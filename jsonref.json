Most us fast through the night – that’s why our first meal is called break-fast. Intermittent fasting tends to extend the period of time that we’re not eating to upwards of 12 hours.Some people go for 14 hours between eating, others go longer. And some people do it every day while others use it as a kind of weekly reset. An old friend of my mum’s, for example, spent 30 years never eating on a Monday. He’d have his last meal on Sunday evening and his next on Tuesday morning.For the most part, it involves dining earlier and breakfasting later. You set aside an eight-hour window in which you can eat what you want (within reason), or to reach your daily calorie intake, and then that’s it. You might have breakfast at 10am, your lunch at 1pm and your dinner at 6pm – and then not eat anything else untli 10am the next day.If you’re eating relatively healthy balanced meals, you should find that during those eight hours, you don’t really get hungry. Most of us snack for about 14 hours a day – and we wonder we’re not seeing the returns we should be from our exercise regimes. This concept allows you to snack within limits.Liam, 34, is a PT who has been intermittently fasting for the past year. In periods when he wasn’t working, he often went for up to 32 hours without a meal – eating only after smashing out weights in the gym today, he only fasts four days a week – although the fasting window is about 23 hours.‘I fast from 8pm the night before until about 5 or 6pm but I don’t fast on gym days,’ he tells .A low-effort way of making gains and maintaining weight (Picture: Ella Byworth for )His fasting days tend to amount to 1,400 calories and he ups that to around 2,800 calories on normal eating days. He claims to have made significant progress in his training and says that fasting allows him to concentrate on other things.‘If I know I’m not going to be eating, I don’t have to spend time shoppingcookingeating,’ he explains.‘I just get on with other stuff – going out or working. It makes you way more efficient with your time and I find it much easier to concentrate on a more empty stomach.’Now that sounds fair enough if you’re one of the lucky people who eat to live, rather than lives to eat. For many of us, however, food is something we love and look forward to – it’s the reason we train hard. So that’s when the 16:8 rule comes in – sticking to that eight-hour window and prioritising when you want to eat means that you can benefit from fasting without really denying yourself. As long as you try to eat healthily for most of the time, you should be able to have your cake and eat it.It’s supposed to be an easy and effective way of getting lean without having to go on a diet. You’re not restricting calories, you’re not embarking on any stupid fat-free, carb-free, sugar-free plan. You’re eating normally, just in a shorter period of time. And because you’er not depriving your body of nutritents, it’s supposed to be a really good way of maintaining muscle mass while getting lean (which is oten hard to balance).Like most things, it might seem like a new wellness fad but intermittent fasting has been around for centuries (Pythagoras was a fan).Remember the 5:2 diet (eating 500 calories twice a week and your normal calorie allowance five days week)? That was a type of intermittent fasting. But this timed approach sounds both easier and less miserable than its predecessor.Intermittent fasting is supposed to help make the body more efficient in how it burns and uses fuel, rather than forcing it to lose weight.When you eat a meal, your body spends a few hours processing the food, taking and absorbing nutrients and working out what it can use. Because of all the readily available fuel you’ve provided it with, your body will choose to burn food as energy, rather than stored fat. And that’s epceially true when you eat carbohydrates and sugars they’re readily available and easy to turn into glycogen.If you struggle with snacking, this might help (Picture: Ella Byworth for )Turning fat into fuel (ketosis) takes a little more effort and means that you’re forcing the body to become more efficient in fat burning the result (if you don’t go overboard in what you choose to eat) should be a reduction in body fat and a maintenance (and perhaps even an increase) in lean muscle.It takes up to about five hours for the body to finish absorbing and digesting and after that period, your body goes into a ‘post-absorptive state’, which lasts up to 12 hours after your meal. That’s when you enter a fasted state – and it’s then that your body finds it easier to burn fat because your insuline levels are low.Most of us never really reach that fasted state. Our culture has increasingly become one of eating regularly so we never really get hungry and we never really recover from digesting and aborbing. Perhaps that’s one of the reasons so many of us struggle with poor gut health – we never give our digestive systems a break.Aside from the benefits, intermittent fasters often claim that their lives are simplier as a result of following suhc a pattern. Wake up, grab a glass of water or coffee and you’re good to go until mid morning or lunchtime. There’s less cooking, less planning and as a result, more time to do other stuff.Back in 1946, scientists discovered that intermittent fasting extended the life of mice. More recently, Harvard researchers concluded that fasting can aincrease life, slow aging and improve overall health by altering hte activity of our cells.They found that fasting can manipulate our mitochondrial networks (they’re the tiny power plants inside our cells) to keep them in a youthful state. Our networks tend to alternate between being fused and fragmented the Harvardstudy found that fasting can promote homeostatis (being in a regular state) in these networks, allowing for a healthy plasticity between the fused and fragmented states.Senior author on the study, William Mair, said: ‘Our work shows how crucial the plasticity of mitochondria networks is for the benefits of fasting,’ the study said.‘If we lock mitochondria in one state, we completely block the effects of fasting or dietary restriction on longevity.’Of course, longevity is down to a whole host of factors, but anything’s worth a shot.‘Going without food for 14 hours can help as in the longer term it may help the way that cells respond to glucose and insulin, and also help lower blood pressure,’ Nutrition consultant and founder of #nutribollocks, Ian Marber, tells .If you have disordered eating or think you might struggle mentally with any form of restrictive eating, you may want to give intermittent fasting a pass.There’s also your social life to think of. If you tend to socialise around food, think about how you’ll navigate those events. Perhaps you only want to fast a couple of days a week when you know that you won’t have any supper parties or events to go to. Perhaps it’s a case of revolutionising how you socialise – swapping meals for activities, for example.Set your hoursIt’s no good deciding that you’re going to go for 23 hours in between each feed if you’ve never done it before. Start small and see how you get on.A good place to start would be to stop eating at 8pm and resume eating at 10am (giving you a 10 hour eating period) and then scale that back to 7pm and 11am (that golden eight-hour window). And if you want to eat a little more during the window, then go back even further and miss morning munch altogether and eat between noon and 7pm.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Decide on your calorie intake and your cheat daysSo unlike the dreaded 5:2, this kind of fasting works on the principal that you keep your calories basically the same. For most of us, we’d probably be looking to stick with our maintenance calories – but if calorie counting isn’t for you, just eat as you normally would.To ensure that you actually stick with it, plan a day when you’re going to eat what and when you want to. It might be every Saturday (who’d want to miss out on brunch?), or it could be all weekend. Whenever it is, use that as your time for having late dinners and early breakfasts.Work out what you want to get out of itIs it just that you want to streamline your life, or do you want to lose body fat without obsessing over calories and scales? Whatever it is, concentrate on that and you should be able to make it through those sneaky 9pm munchies.Anyone fancy a Branston Pickle doughnut for National Doughnut Week?Ramadan 2018: Best places in London to go to for Iftar and break your fastIf you tend to get home from work late, think about meal prepping. Rather than taking your breakfast into work, how about taking in your dinner instead? That way you’re not rushing home to cook and eat in your assigned window.Where does your exercise fit in?Since fasting, Liam tells us that he’s has reduced the number of days he spends in the gym and that’s not uncommon. People often report that they find themselves needing to work out for less time to see the same results. Fasted cardio is supposed to be the thing for fat loss so if that’s your goal, see if you can runcycle to work or gym before your fast ends. If you find that you’re struggling due to low blood sugar, then workout after you’ve eaten your first meal and see if over time that changes.As we’ve said, people have intermittently fasted for donkey’s years. Ramadan is essentially an inverted intermittent fast (with believers fasting during the day rather than overnight). It’s not dangerous when you’re doing it sensibly.Just make sure that you already have a healthy relationship with food before you start messing around with it if you have a tendency to worry about dieting or calories, do not attempt to fast.Fasting could become a problem if you start to obsess over what you’re going to eat and keep increasing the fasting window. Sure, some yogis can go for three days without eating but if you’re pushing the physical boundaries in a bid to lose weight, then you may need to seek advice or help.Make sure that you really do get your full fill of food during your eating window – and if you’re struggling to eat when you do have the opportunity or you find yourself making that window increasingly smaller, contact somewhere like Beat, who can help.Over the next month, I’m going to be giving intermittent fasting a go to see just how easy and effective it really is.

He was ready to step up because the first 25 minutes were really tough.‘They played really well and we were under a bit of pressure.‘But then he got an assist with an excellent corner and he could have had another two or three with the quality of his passing.’One of the biggest conundrums facing Arteta should he be appointed concerns Aaron Ramsey’s future.Arsenal, yet again, find themselves in a scenario whereby one of their most important and influential players is left with just 12 months remaining on his contract.Ramsey has just enjoyed one of his best campaigns in an Arsenal shirt and was rewarded with the captain’s armband in Wenger’s final game.Were it not for his delicate contractual situation, the 27-year-old would represent a natural successor to Laurent Koscielny, whose days as a top class centre-half appear numbered after his Achilles’ gave up on him against Atletico Madrid.Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta were in Arsenal’s midfield together in the 2014 FA Cup final win over Hull (Picture: Getty)Reports claim Arsenal are minded to sell Ramsey, rather than allow him to run down his current deal, but losing a player of the Welshman’s quality would surely represent an early blow, given how highly Arteta rates his former midfield partner and the lack of funds he would have available to replace him.‘A player like this coming from midfield to score that many goals gives you something extra,’ Arteta noted after Ramsey scored a last minute opening day winner against Crystal Palace back in August 2015.‘He reminds me a bit of Fabregas when he was here. At his best, Fabregas was coming off the front, making the final ball and scoring very important goals.Aaron Ramsey’s current contract expires in the summer of 2019 (Picture: Getty)‘I think he will get better with experience and confidence. People fear him now because they know he can create things and that gives you an extra yard, which is very important.‘We don’t have someone to score 30 or 40 goals so players who can score from the middle is very important.’Arsenal’s measly warchest totals just £50million after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the second year in succession, according to reports.Those transfer funds could well be boosted by the sales of several high-profile first team players and Bellerin, perhaps, represents the most expendable given his value allied to the lack of significant progress he has made in recent years.The 23-year-old, who signed a long-term contract in October 2016, has nailed his colours to Arsenal’s mast in the last week, twice giving interviews in which he described London as his home.Hector Bellerin made his Arsenal debut, coming on a substitute for Mikel Arteta against West Brom in September 2013 (Picture: Getty)Despite his public pledge of loyalty, Manchester United and Juventus, as well as his former club Barcelona, continue to monitor his situation carefully. Given he claims to have predicted Bellerin’s rapid rise, Arteta will no doubt hope to keep hold of his compatriot.‘I’ve been really impressed with Hector since he came into the first team – perhaps even more with his attitude than his quality, because I knew all about that,’ Arteta said during Bellerin’s breakthrough 201415 season.‘He has the attributes to become one of the club’s most important players. He is very brave, his decision making is good and he’s a great athlete. He is very open, he is willing to understand what the manager and the team want from him on the pitch and his attitude and contribution have been really good.’Petr Ceh joined Arsenal from Chelsea in the summer of 2015 (Picture: Getty)Petr Cech has come nowhere close to fulfilling the prediction of John Terry, who claimed his former teammate would save his new team between 12 and 15 points a season, and will, in all likelihood, lose his position as Arsenal’s No.1 next season.Time has rapidly caught up with Cech’s battle-weary body and though his experience may well prove to be a useful asset, it is no surprise to see Arsenal being heavily linked with Bayer star Bernd Leno.Arteta faces a relatively straightforward task in demoting his former teammate, but the comments he made upon the veteran joining Arsenal are particularly telling.Bernd Leno has been heavily linked with a summer move to Arsenal (Picture: EPA)Cech’s hunger and bravery, clearly curried favour with Arteta, who clearly recognises the impact sound transfer business can have on a club as a whole.‘His ambition is coming out even though he has won everything in England and in Europe,’ said Arteta, almost two years ago.‘These type of signings give a lift to the whole team. He’s not just a good goalkeeper, he has experience, ambition.‘The decision he made to come here after being a legend at Chelsea is not easy. I don’t think many of them would do it at his age. He is still hungry and he wants to prove himself at the top again and it’s really good decision for us.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12349134.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pictures taken exactly time show world difference just miles apart","story":"Ivanka Trump (third from left) Israel Prime Minister’s wife Sara Netanyahu (second from left), Donald Trump’s son-in-law and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner (right) and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) attend the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem as Palestinians carry a wounded protester during clashes near the Gaza-Israel border (Picture: EPA)A baby who breathed in teargas was among 58 Palestinians killed in violent clashes along the Gaza border with Israel on Monday.Just a few miles away at almost the exact same time, Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner and several other senior White House figures were all smiles as they officially opened the new US embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.Ivanka’s father, US president Donald Trump tweeted it was a ‘great day for Israel’ while Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a ‘glorious day’.‘Remember this moment.

Go on a few viewings and you’re bound to discover that the living room you saw online is in fact just a sofa wedged awkwardly into one of the bedrooms.It’s hard to know what’s normal or what we can expect for what we can afford to pay.To make things a little clearer we launched What I Rent, a weekly series that takes you inside the homes of people renting in London.This week we’re having a nose around James’s one bedroom flat.James lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Crystal Palace. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Let’s chat money. How much are you paying each month?Never thought I’d pay four figures for rent. When I came to see the place I went thinking I wouldn’t take it, but once I stepped inside I was like, f*** it. It’s really decent and actually yeah, I would like a garden.And what about bills?About £150, I guess.Tell us about the location.The flat’s in Crystal Palace, about five mins walk from the best park in London.I can walk for about five minutes and look at a physical living farm animal which is absolutely mind-blowing, frankly. And of course there’s the dinosaurs.There’s a bloody decent Gipsy Hill pub practically next door called the Douglas Fir, the station is under 5 mins walk (and there’s no less than FIVE off-licences on that short way home, that’s like an off-licence per minute which is a really good number), up the hill there’s the Westow House pub which seems pretty lively, and the triangular high street that has a decent selection of shops and cracking views of London.There’s a bedroom, a living room and dining area, a kitchen, and a bathroom. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I think the other thing that hit me moving was how much more chilled out the south feels. I was in Stratford before which was flat, grey, and was kinda aggro.And how much greener it all is – I didn’t realise how much I liked trees until I was surrounded by them.I don’t think I’ll ever live north of the river again, and if I want to go there it’s p*ss easy to get to on the Overground*.I really don’t understand people that are so desperate to live in Zone 1 they pay £2k for a box room in Kensington or whatever. They are doing it wrong.*Until about midnight, in which case it’s buses from New Cross Gate or a train if you’re lucky.What’s the flat like?It’s a self-contained single bedroom flat, so just a bedroom, sitting room, one bathroom and kitchen.The bedroom’s not massive, but it does the job. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How long have you been there?It looks a bit spartan at the moment but I’m going to work on the garden and make it a cozy den with plants and lights and a barbecue, all that gaffDo you feel like you have enough space?Totally. The bedroom is a little cramped but I spend most of the time sitting in the garden or in the living room. Loads of storage in the kitchen.It’s not a huge place but it’s big enough. Be nice if the ceilings were a bit higher I guess, but I can’t really complain.How did you find it?First day of looking at places and saw some pretty awful ones (the view from one was a McDonald’s on a roundabout in a retail park in Charlton), then I had a look on OpenRent. Can’t recommend that site enough.I hear about everyone paying hundreds of pounds in fees and having to mess about with dodgy letting agents.I paid £20 in fees for a background check and the process of putting down a holding deposit was simple – I did it on my phone as soon as I left the viewing (you have to move so fast, the person viewing it before me was already talking money). Also I reckon the sort of landlord that’s going to use it is probably a bit more friendly and forward thinking – mine seems like a really nice bloke.James has only lived in the flat for a month, so is looking forward to make it more his own. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you like living alone?Well my girlfriend is here most of the time so it’s not like I’m lonely, but it’s nice having my own place again. Currently working on getting mates to travel all the way here on the regs but they seem quite happy to do this once they’ve sat in the park with a big bag of cans and realised how great it is.Is there anything you don’t like about where you live?It’s a bitch to get to once the Overground is done.We were at a rave in Hackney Marshes the other week and being on the bus for nearly two hours at 5AM when you’ve been dancing in a field for god know’s how long isn’t an experience I’d particularly recommend.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamAny plans to move again?I’m really happy here, I don’t think I’d want to live anywhere else in London really.When I move it’ll probably be to Berlin or Barcelona or somewhere like that.And… have you thought about buying a place?I’ve never seen that as something that was possible so I don’t waste time entertaining the thought.What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying.

I am openly gay, but that should never be an invitation.Jordan reached out to Uber with the complaint and received an apology from the app’s customer service team.

She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Footage of people running away from knifeman in ParisShocking moment of teacher body slamming a student during classMeghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealed\u0027We\u0027ve got him!\u0027: Locals block road to help police catch \u0027burglar\u0027Injured co-pilot recovers after being \u0027sucked out of plane\u0027Shocking moment prison inmate chats to blogger live from his cellReal life \u0027Forrest Gump\u0027 proposes at finish line of 590 marathonsShocking moment elderly man slaps granddaughter round the headMoment heroic dog jumps into swimming pool to rescue canine palPassenger launches vicious attack on bus driver in Dublin"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/10/4C2A21B100000578-0-image-m-16_1526202287952.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan stay separate Windsor hotels night wedding","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on May 19 in Windsor but will stay apart on the night before  Prince Harry will stay at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park (pictured) in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Friday, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei  Harry and his brother will enjoy sumptuously furnished bedrooms like this on the night before walking down the aisle  Meghan will stay at Cliveden House Hotel (pictured), on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate, with her mother Doria.

The horse rescuer has revealed there has been a huge number of horses being mistreated There’s Daisy, found as a stray in the streets of Chessington Thelma and Louise, left loose in the back roads of Dunsfold Teddy, a young stallion dumped on private property, and Ziggy, another young stallion, abandoned with a filly to wander the lanes.Yesterday’s Mail carried the shocking picture of a pony dumped in the small garden of a home in Stoke-on-Trent.The owner had placed an online advert saying the pony would be put down if nobody could take it, and a 13-year-old girl replied with her grandmother’s address. A man then arrived, dumped the pony and disappeared. In the past few years, horses have been abandoned in their thousands — and it’s getting worse.The RSPCA said last month the number of horses it had rescued has hit a four-year high, with 980 horses being taken into care last year and an average of 80 phone calls a day coming in about horses. Many are in terrible health.Some come from breeders with too many foals who don’t care what happens to them, so long as it costs their business nothing.          Landowners are simply unable to keep their horses due to financial woes and others \u0027simply don\u0027t care\u0027 Jenny Seagrove saysSince the horse meat food scandal in 2013, when sickened shoppers learned that horseflesh was being used in many supermarket ‘beef’ products, the secretive market for human consumption has been shut off to these unscrupulous breeders.But with economic troubles, and the cost of land rising, many private owners are just unable to keep their horses.Some come to us in desperation. They have lost their jobs, fallen ill or been through a orce, and simply can’t afford to stable their beloved animal. Others are getting old and can no longer cope. In some cases, one horse has died and left a second miserable and lonely — a busy sanctuary is a happier place to spend twilight years than an empty field.I have deep sympathy with these owners. If they come to us, they are doing the best they can for their horses.But many others simply don’t care. They condemn their animals to live and die in conditions that beggar belief. Take Millie and Horus — a young mare, and a handsome stallion in his early 20s.They were left in a field of about 100 horses with no food or water. When rescuers found them, the field was scattered with dead and dying animals — Millie and Horus were among the survivors.Woman whose two thoroughbreds were so malnourished they had...A night-mare! Woody looks like the whitest horse in the...Share this articleTwo of our gentlest creatures are mother and daughter, Gwen and Phyllis. Gwen had been savagely beaten and tethered to a goalpost to give birth, and was cut loose, terrified and traumatised.It never fails to baffle me that people treat horses so brutally.One of our herd leaders was called Ernie, a gentle giant 18 hands high, a favourite with mares and visitors. Everyone loved Ernie. But it wasn’t always the case. When he came to us, he would bite the hands and faces of anyone who got too close. He’d been beaten so badly he defended himself against all humans. Gradually, we taught him he didn’t have to be afraid.This is the most rewarding work in the world. Mind you, I never set out to run a sanctuary. I’m an actress and I love my work.But, in 2011, someone I knew phoned me with a desperate problem: she was running a private animal rescue centre and had somehow acquired 40 horses and many other animals and birds.It was hardly surprising that she’d run out of money and I just couldn’t turn my back. I realised there was something I could do: I could start a charity that would take responsibility for the animals and their welfare. Little did I know what a huge task that would be.So with friends and the public being amazingly supportive, Mane Chance was born.It wasn’t all plain sailing. At 7am on the first Sunday after our horses moved into their new home, I had an anguished call from a neighbour. Quad bikers had charged through our field, knocked down the electric fences and spooked the horses . . . who were galloping round the 18th green of the local golf club, causing mayhem.          Jenny Seagrove: \u0027I wish I could say it was rare at Mane Chance Sanctuary to take animals that have been so horribly mistreated, but sadly it is all too common\u0027After six months, the ‘non-equine’ residents and some horses were rehomed, as we worked out a manageable number we could care for. Since 2011, that number has risen to 33 — any more and our staff, and tireless volunteers, risk being stretched too thin. Even within those limits, annual running costs are around £300,000. We’re supported by selfless donors, sponsors, grant givers and businesses, but because of the work we do with young people we need staff experienced at working with people as well as horses. And we need good facilities. It all costs money.Our work with young people began with two Shetland ponies called Grimbo and Mr Smith, who loved company.We took them to a local hospice, and I was amazed to see the powerful effect on children who sat or stood with them, stroking them, giving and receiving unconditional love. It was so moving to watch . . . and it gave me an idea.Most of our horses will never be ridden. Some are too old, others have arthritis. But they can help people, just by being horses. Not all our rescue animals are suitable for this work, but many love it.They seem to understand, when a child with a terminal illness, perhaps, or an older person with dementia, is quietly sharing their company, that they are doing important work.We don’t make any horse work if it doesn’t clearly want to. Most are only too happy to be fussed over, though. In fact, they are so content we’ve decided many will never be rehomed — they’ve endured desperate hardship, and now they’ve found a place they love. We owe them the chance to stay.But with Mane Chance at full capacity, and more calls each week, we need to do more. Tighter legislation is part of it: breeders must not continue to dump young stallions just because they have little use for them (unlike mares, which can bear foals).New laws on microchipping, which will lead to a national ownership register called the Central Equine Database, should help. So would better education for the public: people need to understand how costly it is to keep a horse.Humane euthanasia, when a sick animal needs to be put down, costs about £500, for example. It’s never an acceptable option to dump the poor creature in a field instead.Mane Chance is trying to show that horses don’t need to be thrown away. We dream of little rescued herds all over the country, helping people. We save them, but in many ways they save us, too.n The fee for this article has been donated to Mane Chance Sanctuary (manechance sanctuary.org). "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/03/4C3FA82300000578-0-image-a-21_1526352101416.jpg","title":"Squirrels stash 50 pounds pine cones hood car","story":"    Michigan residents said squirrels stashed 50 pounds of pine cones under the hood of a car\u0027He asked me if I had received some Snapchat videos that he had just sent me,\u0027 Awrey told the newspaper.\u0027They didn\u0027t come through, so he pulled up the video on his phone.

Rob travelled back to the UK to witness the birth of his daughter Bee, and managed to run the London marathon at the same timeAveraging an astounding 40 miles a day, Rob combated against ever-changing climates of blistering heat, traitorous rain, and relentless snowfall, raising nearly £37,000 for his two chosen charities, World Wildlife Foundation and Peace Direct.Travelling from east to west twice over and back again, Rob ran for a staggering 422 days, covering 15,607 miles in the process, four times the length of the Amazon river.After traversing his way across 43 states on foot, the Liverpudlian admits he\u0027s ready to return back to normality.Rob said: \u0027I\u0027m unbelievably proud and still surprised to a degree that I actually made it.Little boy steals the show by dropping his pants and PEEING...Run, Forrest, run!

Heart-warming moment...Share this article\u0027Sometimes the magnitude of it all hits me and I just stand there shaking my head, smiling.          The route has taken Rob past many landmarks from the film, including the Marshall Point Lighthouse, in St. George, Maine\u0027I first had the idea to run across America 15 years ago. I thought it would be an incredible way to see a fascinating and beautiful country.\u0027I\u0027d had a number of half-hearted attempts trying to put a run together, but after watching Forrest Gump one night, I had a light-bulb moment.\u0027My mum, who unfortunately isn\u0027t around anymore, was very aware of our impact on the word and always urged me to \u0027do one thing in life that makes a difference.\u0027\u0027I hoped that this run would be an opportunity to do just that - I\u0027m sure she would be very proud.\u0027My girlfriend, Nadine friends and family have been hugely supportive - I think they\u0027ve been half expecting me to do something crazy like this for a while.\u0027It meant everything to me to have Nadine and our newborn daughter, Bee, there at the finish line.\u0027Nadine has been my rock, I couldn\u0027t have done it without her - proposing in that moment felt right.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show baby Bee all of the photos in a few years\u0027 time.\u0027         Though an accomplished marathon runner, Rob admits he wishes he\u0027d done more training prior to his arrival in the US, as a series of nasty injuries have nearly brought a premature end to his inconceivable passage.           Rob ran through many iconic US landmarks - including the midpoint of Route 66 (pictured)          Rob uses running shoes to mark out the 407th day of his 590 day run          Rob poses on the border of Utah with his newborn baby Bee, the same place Forrest ended his epic trek in the 1994 classic film          Rob runs through one of many valleys on his epic US trek          The run began in Mobile, Alabama, in September 2016 and has taken Rob from west to east coast and back again. He is now just 200 miles short of the finish line          Rob began his run in the plaid shirt and chinos made famous by Tom Hanks, but later changed for a bushy beard and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co hat, just like Forrest           Rob also found the time to run in the London Marathon, breaking a world record in the processFrom an inflamed Achilles to a quadriceps tear, the Liverpudlian has had to consistently grimace through the physical pain, while combating the psychological toll of exhaustion, too.Pausing his run briefly at the Twin Arrows Trading Post, in Arizona, to fly back to the UK to witness the birth of his daughter, Rob also found the time to run in the London Marathon, breaking a world record in the process.He became the fastest ever runner to complete the 26.2 mile course in costume, with a time of two hours and 36 minutes.          Rob poses on Route 66 - he says he has sent a postcard to Forrest Gump actor Tom Hanks about the journey          Rob Pope (pictured after finishing the London marathon) broken the Guinness World Record for the fastest male marathon runner in a film character costumeRob said: \u0027Seeing my daughter be born was even more motivation - having her and Nadine at the finish was a dream come true.\u0027I didn\u0027t do any training specifically for the run. I wish I had done, and maintained more core work.\u0027You didn\u0027t see Forrest doing a Rocky montage in the scenes building up to his run - he just put on his shoes and went. I figured I\u0027d do the same.\u0027After my first injury - anterior tibial tendinitis - only 400 miles in, I had a break down in a gas station in front of a poor attendant - I\u0027d put too much into everything to become a failure.          Rob Pope, 39, from Liverpool, has spent 19-months running the equivalent of 590 marathons in order to recreate the route taken by Forrest Gump in the film          In the 1994 film, Forrest completes his run after being left heartbroken by his love, Jenny. For Rob, it was the words of his late mother that inspired him. She once told him: \u0027Do one thing in life that makes a difference\u0027          Rod said he has contacted Tom Hanks about his run, sending him a postcard from Maine, but he has not heard back from the actor          Having completed more than 15,000 miles Rob took a temporary hiatus in order to travel back to the UK and see girlfriend Nadine give birth, he then proposed to her on the finish line\u0027The enormity of it all, the repetition and loneliness have been mentally very tough.\u0027Fortunately though, I was only ever down for short periods, even if illness or injury persisted longer than that.\u0027As a generally very positive person, I had a strong focus - quitting was never going to be an option.\u0027The London Marathon was an added bonus, despite being a hot day I just went for it and even got to meet two of my heroes, Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge - it was a great feeling.\u0027Hoping to inspire others with the spirit of Forrest, Rob, who is still yet to hear from his hero, Tom Hanks, said: \u0027I think the film - and specifically the character of Forrest - is a beautiful tale of life and how we should treat one another.Rob said he had been planning to run across America for 15 years, but decided to recreate Forrest\u0027s route while watching the film one evening          Much like Forrest Gump in the film, Rob\u0027s run attracted attention from the press  Rob pictured competing in a marathon before undertaking his epic run across America\u0027Forrest didn\u0027t judge anyone, not on the colour of their skin, background, intelligence or anything else.\u0027If everyone could be a bit more like Forrest, the world would be a better place.\u0027This is my attempt to make a difference, just as my mum would\u0027ve wanted.\u0027I haven\u0027t heard from Tom yet, but I have sent him a postcard of the Port Clyde Lighthouse, when I completed my second crossing.\u0027He\u0027s an absolute hero of mine, so I\u0027d love to hear from him.\u0027It hasn\u0027t been hard to return back to my old life, I\u0027m a bit weird like that.\u0027I\u0027m a bit weird like that, but the beard is still there and the memories will last a lifetime.\u0027The charities were my main motivation behind this, so I\u0027ll be disappointed if I don\u0027t get over the 100,000 mark.\u0027In the words of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, don\u0027t let all the running be in vain.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/28/17/49AA7C8000000578-5444413-image-a-4_1519839338769.jpg","title":"Pope says hes thought time leave","story":"Pope Francis, flanked by Bishop Angelo De Donatis, delivered a speech during a meeting with the Roman diocese, at the Vatican Basilica of St. John at the Lateran, in Rome, on Monday  Pope Francis, 81, has spoken in a homily about when it might be the right time to \u0027take leave\u0027 of his flock He said: \u0027When I read this, I think about myself, because I\u0027m a bishop and I\u0027ll have to take my leave.\u0027Francis has previously said that retired Pope Benedict XVI \u0027opened a door\u0027 to future popes by resigning. Although the 81-year-old pope has said he does not envisage a long papacy, he has not yet revealed when, or whether, he plans to retire.The Vatican has not released the full text from his homily. Mormon church is severing all ties with Boy Scouts after 105...\u0027I don\u0027t like your religion.

It has also hurt the pope\u0027s own image because this year he strongly defended a bishop accused in the alleged cover-up before reversing his position.Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of the city of San Bernardo said he could not rule out some of the tainted bishops resigning or being sacked, as many Chileans have demanded.\u0027It does not depend on us. Each person must decide this together with the pope,\u0027 he said.  Representatives of the Chilean bishops conference Luis Fernando Ramos Perez, left, and Juan Ignacio Gonzalez, met with reporters at the Vatican on Monday. Thirty-four Chilean bishops have been summoned to the Vatican over a cover-up of sexual abuse by clergyOne of the key bishops in the crisis is Juan Barros, whom the pope appointed to the southern city of Osorno in 2015 despite allegations that he had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor, Father Fernando Karadima. Barros has said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.Luis Badilla, a Rome-based Chilean commentator for the Vatican-affiliated blog \u0027Il Sismografo\u0027, called for \u0027exemplary and educational decisions\u0027 by the pope to put the Chilean Church back on course.During his trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were \u0027slander\u0027 until proven otherwise.But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. He produced a 2,300-page report that will be discussed at the Vatican meetings. Victims have also accused other bishops of either covering up the abuse by Karadima, of delaying investigations, or of discrediting victims in the media and demonizing them in private conversations and emails.Last month, Francis held four days of meetings with Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, three men abused by Karadima when they were teenagers in Santiago.They said in a statement afterwards that they had been \u0027treated as enemies\u0027 by Chilean Church leaders for 10 years.Karadima, who trained some of the bishops for the priesthood decades ago, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s.He never faced civilian justice because of the statute of limitations. Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile, Karadima has always denied the allegations.At the pre-meeting news conference, Gonzalez said he had met many victims and knew the three who met the pope last month.One of the victims, Cruz, later tweeted: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen him before in my life. The truth according to the bishops of Chile is very different from what we all have lived.\u0027In a stern statement last Saturday, the Vatican indicated that the pope intended to be tough.It spoke of \u0027cover-ups and grave omissions regarding the victims\u0027 and said the meetings would seek to determine \u0027collective and inidual responsibility for these devastating wounds\u0027.In a homily at his daily morning Mass on Tuesday, without specifically mentioning Chile, Francis said every bishop should know \u0027when itâs time to take his leave and step down\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/10/4C42010E00000578-0-image-m-34_1526376527859.jpg","title":"Sweden needs 124 000 public sector workers 2025","story":"    Public sector crisis: The Swedish public sector needs another 124,000 workers by 2025 in order to maintain its welfare state as its population agesThe public sector is the biggest employer in Sweden, however, due to the projected demographic changes in the country, it now requires more workers. The annual report from the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL) found that the lack of public sector workers will eventually put the country\u0027s world-famous welfare state at risk. Swedish mother RENAMES her son to match her botched tattoo,...Share this articleTo keep the current level of service provision, the Swedish public sector needs an additional 124,000 workers by 2025.This would mean 60 per cent of the total workforce increase - estimated at 207,000 people.At the moment, around 30 per cent of those entering the workforce do so into the public sector - a figure which has remained largely unchanged  for the past ten years.           No pain, no gain: Sweden has high taxes, but as a result its population benefits from national healthcare, free primary and university education and heavily subsidized care for the elderlyAs a result, SKL writes in its report, the goal of 124,000 new public sector workers in the next seven years is \u0027not realistic\u0027. \u0027Instead, productivity in the public sector - as in the private sector - must increase.\u0027SKL chairman Lena Micko says: \u0027The public sector will need to recruit, but we also need new working methods where we utilise the possibilities of technology to ease workload and make staff more effective.\u0027Making working full time the norm, and having a longer working life could also decrease the need for more co-workers,\u0027 she adds.SKL writes in the report that an increase of funds is necessary to be able to sustain the current welfare state, which it suggests could be sourced from increased taxes. As Sweden is going to the polls in September, suggestions of raising already high taxes could prove controversial. The main issues during the election campaign are expected to be health care, education and immigration, with the far-right Sweden Democrats yet again on the rise following the country\u0027s record immigration figures.Sweden has registered around 400,000 asylum requests since 2012, or one for every 25 inhabitants - the highest in Europe. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/12/31245AF500000578-0-In_this_handout_photo_provided_by_the_German_Government_Press_Of-a-41_1526382336829.jpg","title":"What Amal Clooneys net worth human rights lawyers worth revealed","story":"    International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney seen here speaking during Senior Day activities at Vanderbilt University in May 2018‘Courage, as they say, is contagious.

Although Scouting was traditionally a male pursuit, since 2013, female participation  grew substantially and there are now 102,000 members.  Muslim children have also been swelling the ranks since changes to uniform policy  allowing long sleeves and a hooded dress for Muslim girls was introduced in 2012.834 units have been established in areas of deprivation and the organisation wants to expand that by 500 before 2023.    Although the badge will not change and the traditional fleur de lis symbol still features in the logo, the branding has been reimagined to work with digital communications and to better reflect the organisations inclusivity goals. The Scout Association currently has 638,827 members in the UK. 10,699 new youth members and 9,371 adult volunteers have joined so far this year. But it is battling to reduce its waiting list, which currently has 57,000 children, but the organisation needs more adult volunteers to cope with more members."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/15/4C47902F00000578-5731629-image-a-274_1526396072222.jpg","title":"Ex Beach star Nicole Bass came home Las Vegas burglars raided flat","story":"     Nicole Bass, 26, had her flat in Dartford, Kent burglarised last June.

Above Dexter is seen posing nude on the end of his bed Cook also took a photo of Dexter completely naked sitting on the end of his bed watching what looks to be a classic movie on the TV.In other snaps Dexter - Mario Singer\u0027s former mistress - is seen kissing the gray-haired architect\u0027s face and the pair also pose for a number of selfies together, one in the garden of his pristine Hamptons home.In some shots Cook is seen wearing a white t-shirt with the words Sag Harbor written across it - the name of the town where his $2.2million waterfront property sits.The three-bedroom home boasts its own dock, wraparound deck and beautiful grounds.DailyMail.com has reached out to Cook for comment. A close friend of Dexter said the pair made the most of the cozy property during the \u0027sex-filled\u0027 trip. The friend, Ali Moore, has also told DailyMail.com that while Dexter enjoyed her time with Cook, she is less than happy at his \u0027ridiculous\u0027 claim they never got together.She says his denial was \u0027hurtful\u0027 to Dexter and she may call time on the relationship.Moore also confirmed details of the trip, saying she spoke with Dexter at length when she got back to Florida.\u0027Peter and Kasey had been texting each other for days and then he invited her to come visit him in the Hamptons,\u0027 Moore explained.\u0027Kasey loved the idea because she kind of liked him and it seemed like fun.          The friend says Cook and Dexter had been \u0027texting each other for days\u0027 before he invited her over to his home. Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027           The friend revealed that Dexter (pictured with Cook in his home) was unhappy about Cook\u0027s claim that the encounter never happened           This is Cook\u0027s $2.2million waterfront property where the two spent five days together \u0027Peter flew her to LaGuardia (airport) on Thursday and she spent the first night at a friend\u0027s house in East Hampton then on Friday Peter came and met her at The American Hotel.\u0027When Peter arrived, Kasey immediately thought he was hot. He obviously felt the same because she had sent him a lot of sexy pictures so there was definitely chemistry.\u0027Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027.\u0027She said he wasn\u0027t a bad guy like she had heard, in fact she really liked him,\u0027 she said.Share this article\u0027He took her for manicures and pedicures and they went to the movie \u0027I Feel Pretty\u0027 with Amy Schumer. They actually had fun together, so it was really hurtful to her when he denied they even were together.\u0027They really got to know each other. Every night they watched old classic movies and he made her latte\u0027s in the morning and brought them to bed.\u0027It seems ridiculous that he would deny it. It\u0027s wrong for him to be embarrassed since he flew her there and she is beautiful and they spent so many days together.\u0027           Cook, who was married to supermodel Christie Brinkley for 12 years, is said to have a \u0027secret pathological predilection\u0027 for younger women. The two famously split after he was caught having an affair with an 18-year-old girl   Dexter, 36, is the former mistress of Mario Singer, the ex-husband of Real Housewife Ramona Singer (right). The two ended their relationship earlier this year Moore claims Cook even bought Dexter a new cell phone, on which many of the photos obtained by DailyMail.com were taken.\u0027That\u0027s another reason why he can\u0027t deny they had an \u0027encounter\u0027 as he referred to it,\u0027 said Moore.\u0027It seems like Peter still wants to be with her because he keeps texting her.\u0027But she might be done with him because he is acting ridiculous about their relationship being public. He has even asked her to talk to his publicist. She has no interest.\u0027Moore says Dexter told her that Cook said he was falling in love with her.\u0027Peter told Kasey: I\u0027m falling for you. You are so beautiful, even with no make-up. After their time, at the airport he expressed that he wanted her to come back and visit and begged her not to see any other young men.\u0027He also was concerned she only came to visit him to make Mario jealous, so he asked her not to go back to Mario.\u0027Cook famously split with supermodel Christie Brinkley in 2008 after cheating on her with Diana Bianchi who he had hired to work at his architecture firm as an assistant at age 18.The couple, who were married for six years, then fought a bitter custody battle over their children, Sailor and Jack, as well as a fierce legal fight over money.Cook\u0027s attorney denied any infidelity but Brinkley still emerged the winner, handing him just $2.1million of her estimated $60million fortune.There were also reports that during the time he was dating Brinkley, whom he married in 1996, Cook was allegedly carrying on a relationship with then 19-year-old, Samantha Cole. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/16/4C43810700000578-5732051-image-m-9_1526399516443.jpg","title":"eBay blasted claims app details exact location parked vehicles sale","story":"    Viewers of this advert for a Suzuki were able to zoom in on it\u0027s \u0027collection in person\u0027 location (above) to reveal the house outside which it was parked (below)          Members of a Facebook page mocked the online shopping giant when the function was exposed in the appWhen viewing a 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, priced at £17,300, the app shows the \u0027collection in person\u0027 area as Bracknell.But when users click on \u0027Bracknell\u0027, they are then able to zoom right in to show the precise postcode, starting RG12, and then able to see where the seller\u0027s house is.A separate search of a Suzuki motorcycle, priced at £850, lists the area as Ipswich but when clicking on the location, the postcode and quiet street where the item has been sold at is shown.

I tried to break away at the branches that were all tied up around me.\u0027(The people that came to save me) said they saw a collie run along towards them on their own, and that they thought it was strange.          They followed the Bonnie for around 500 yards, down several winding paths, before finding Val - who was astonished her beloved pet had returned - and with help in tow          Val said she had been out for the day walking when she took a few wrong turns, ended up on a different path and got overwhelmed by thick, gnarly shrubs\u0027She was beckoning for them to come with her. So they followed her 500 yards or so and then they heard this cracking noise, and could hear me through the brambles.\u0027They then got me out, took me home and gave me a nice cup of tea and some biscuits.\u0027Val sadly didn\u0027t grab the names of the teachers who saved her but she\u0027s overwhelmed by what they did, not to mention astonished by the heroic actions of her dog.Now recovering from her ordeal at home, Val said she\u0027d love to track back down the teachers who raced to her aid.She was also astonished by her dog\u0027s actions.  \u0027I feels that she loves me,\u0027 she said.\u0027She didn\u0027t just run off anywhere and sit down she went to get someone, and to think it was quite far away from anywhere as well.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/05/4C3201D100000578-0-image-m-68_1526360052613.jpg","title":"Modigliani sells 157 2 mn New York Sothebys","story":"Nu Couche(sur le cote gauche) by Amedeo Modigliani sold for $157.2 million in New York, becoming the fourth most expensive work of art sold at auctionModigliani follows Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso as the third highest-selling artist at auction.

I thought it would be an incredible way to see a fascinating and beautiful country.\u0027I\u0027d had a number of half-hearted attempts trying to put a run together, but after watching Forrest Gump one night, I had a light-bulb moment.\u0027My mum, who unfortunately isn\u0027t around anymore, was very aware of our impact on the word and always urged me to \u0027do one thing in life that makes a difference.\u0027\u0027I hoped that this run would be an opportunity to do just that - I\u0027m sure she would be very proud.\u0027My girlfriend, Nadine friends and family have been hugely supportive - I think they\u0027ve been half expecting me to do something crazy like this for a while.\u0027It meant everything to me to have Nadine and our newborn daughter, Bee, there at the finish line.\u0027Nadine has been my rock, I couldn\u0027t have done it without her - proposing in that moment felt right.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show baby Bee all of the photos in a few years\u0027 time.\u0027         Though an accomplished marathon runner, Rob admits he wishes he\u0027d done more training prior to his arrival in the US, as a series of nasty injuries have nearly brought a premature end to his inconceivable passage.           Rob ran through many iconic US landmarks - including the midpoint of Route 66 (pictured)          Rob uses running shoes to mark out the 407th day of his 590 day run          Rob poses on the border of Utah with his newborn baby Bee, the same place Forrest ended his epic trek in the 1994 classic film          Rob runs through one of many valleys on his epic US trek          The run began in Mobile, Alabama, in September 2016 and has taken Rob from west to east coast and back again.

It has also hurt the pope\u0027s own image because this year he strongly defended a bishop accused in the alleged cover-up before reversing his position.Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of the city of San Bernardo said he could not rule out some of the tainted bishops resigning or being sacked, as many Chileans have demanded.\u0027It does not depend on us. Each person must decide this together with the pope,\u0027 he said.  Representatives of the Chilean bishops conference Luis Fernando Ramos Perez, left, and Juan Ignacio Gonzalez, met with reporters at the Vatican on Monday. Thirty-four Chilean bishops have been summoned to the Vatican over a cover-up of sexual abuse by clergyOne of the key bishops in the crisis is Juan Barros, whom the pope appointed to the southern city of Osorno in 2015 despite allegations that he had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor, Father Fernando Karadima. Barros has said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.Luis Badilla, a Rome-based Chilean commentator for the Vatican-affiliated blog \u0027Il Sismografo\u0027, called for \u0027exemplary and educational decisions\u0027 by the pope to put the Chilean Church back on course.During his trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were \u0027slander\u0027 until proven otherwise.But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. He produced a 2,300-page report that will be discussed at the Vatican meetings. Victims have also accused other bishops of either covering up the abuse by Karadima, of delaying investigations, or of discrediting victims in the media and demonizing them in private conversations and emails.Last month, Francis held four days of meetings with Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, three men abused by Karadima when they were teenagers in Santiago.They said in a statement afterwards that they had been \u0027treated as enemies\u0027 by Chilean Church leaders for 10 years.Karadima, who trained some of the bishops for the priesthood decades ago, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s.He never faced civilian justice because of the statute of limitations. Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile, Karadima has always denied the allegations.At the pre-meeting news conference, Gonzalez said he had met many victims and knew the three who met the pope last month.One of the victims, Cruz, later tweeted: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen him before in my life. The truth according to the bishops of Chile is very different from what we all have lived.\u0027In a stern statement last Saturday, the Vatican indicated that the pope intended to be tough.It spoke of \u0027cover-ups and grave omissions regarding the victims\u0027 and said the meetings would seek to determine \u0027collective and inidual responsibility for these devastating wounds\u0027.In a homily at his daily morning Mass on Tuesday, without specifically mentioning Chile, Francis said every bishop should know \u0027when itâs time to take his leave and step down\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/14/4C454ACD00000578-0-image-a-10_1526390031411.jpg","title":"Steamy photos Peter Cook Kasey Dexter Hamptons home","story":"Proof: Steamy photos shared exclusively with DailyMail.com show Peter Cook and his new lover Kasey Dexter at his Hamptons home earlier this month   One racy shot shows Cook, 59, cupping the breast of his younger lover, 36 in a mirror selfie           Cook had denied rumors of an \u0027encounter\u0027 with Dexter, but a close friend revealed the two had a \u0027sex-filled\u0027 trip.

It\u0027s wrong for him to be embarrassed since he flew her there and she is beautiful and they spent so many days together.\u0027           Cook, who was married to supermodel Christie Brinkley for 12 years, is said to have a \u0027secret pathological predilection\u0027 for younger women. The two famously split after he was caught having an affair with an 18-year-old girl   Dexter, 36, is the former mistress of Mario Singer, the ex-husband of Real Housewife Ramona Singer (right). The two ended their relationship earlier this year Moore claims Cook even bought Dexter a new cell phone, on which many of the photos obtained by DailyMail.com were taken.\u0027That\u0027s another reason why he can\u0027t deny they had an \u0027encounter\u0027 as he referred to it,\u0027 said Moore.\u0027It seems like Peter still wants to be with her because he keeps texting her.\u0027But she might be done with him because he is acting ridiculous about their relationship being public. He has even asked her to talk to his publicist. She has no interest.\u0027Moore says Dexter told her that Cook said he was falling in love with her.\u0027Peter told Kasey: I\u0027m falling for you. You are so beautiful, even with no make-up. After their time, at the airport he expressed that he wanted her to come back and visit and begged her not to see any other young men.\u0027He also was concerned she only came to visit him to make Mario jealous, so he asked her not to go back to Mario.\u0027Cook famously split with supermodel Christie Brinkley in 2008 after cheating on her with Diana Bianchi who he had hired to work at his architecture firm as an assistant at age 18.The couple, who were married for six years, then fought a bitter custody battle over their children, Sailor and Jack, as well as a fierce legal fight over money.Cook\u0027s attorney denied any infidelity but Brinkley still emerged the winner, handing him just $2.1million of her estimated $60million fortune.There were also reports that during the time he was dating Brinkley, whom he married in 1996, Cook was allegedly carrying on a relationship with then 19-year-old, Samantha Cole. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/08/4C3AEB2900000578-0-image-a-3_1526369759087.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles father changes mind wants come wedding doctors let him","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s Dad Thomas Now Wants to Walk Daughter Down the Aisle | TMZ.com"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/16/4C47D2AB00000578-0-image-m-29_1526399027897.jpg","title":"Scottish Parliament REJECTS crucial Brexit legislation","story":"    MSPs at Holyrood (headed by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured) have formally refused to grant consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill by 93 votes to 30The Scottish Parliament today voted down crucial Brexit-related legislation - sparking fears of a constitutional crisis.    MSPs at Holyrood have formally refused to grant consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill by 93 votes to 30.It is the first time the devolved Parliament has withdrawn its stamp of approval for legislation coming from Westminster.  They blocked the crucial legislation from being passed amid a row whether powers returned to the UK from the EU should be handed to Edinburgh or London.Despite the vote, Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell has vowed this will \u0027not be the end of the process\u0027.The two Governments aim to settle their long-running dispute over where powers returning to the UK post-Brexit should be held.Protesters clash with police and slam ministers for rolling...MPs vote down fresh bid to launch Leveson 2 inquiry into the...Share this article    The move is a blow to Theresa May (pictured today with members of the UK Invictus Games team) who is trying to steer Brexit through the UK "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec605e344bb52dca8cde2f98c23882645a7b0c31/0_8_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e51a477822a5541b9fd962975fd944a","title":"modigliani nu couche sur le cote gauche sothebys new york 157m","story":"Sotheby’s billed the $157m nude as a proto-feminist portrait of a sexually confident modern woman. In fact, she’s little more than a soft-hued rehash of paintings by more daring innovatorsModigliani is no Leonardo da Vinci. He isn’t even a De Kooning, a Cézanne or a Gauguin. All those artists have had paintings sell at auction for more than $200m. Leonardo’s Salvator Mundi looks set to hold its $450.3m world record for a good while to come, after Modigliani’s Nu Couché (Sur le Côté Gauche) achieved a “mere” $157.2m (£116m) at Sotheby’s in New York last night. Still a nice bit of cash, but far from the astronomical, record-beating sums that were being imagined.I am not surprised. Even in the unreal world of art sales there has to be some relationship between hype and fact. Modigliani’s painting was being sold as something it is not, which some bidders were bound to notice. It was being praised not for its own merits but for a supposed place in cultural and social history that can’t actually be seen on the canvas.Taking their cue from the idealistic catalogue of Tate Modern’s recent Modigliani exhibition – which included this painting – and with an eye to today’s gender politics, Sotheby’s talked up this luxuriant nude as an iconoclastic, radical artwork. “This is a nude of a very self-possessed, sexually self-confident woman” who is “absolutely meeting our gaze”, said Sotheby’s co-head of worldwide impressionist and modern art, Simon Shaw. Painted in 1917 when the first world war was changing the social power of women, Nu Couché purportedly reflects that revolutionary moment as a woman lying with her back to us turns her head to look boldly out of the painting.You can see why this description of the painting suits Sotheby’s. Any male buyer who might feel embarrassed about purchasing a sensationally carnal picture of a naked woman to slaver over can rest assured that she’s a strong, self-possessed woman.Unfortunately, this is a fairytale. Even if Modigliani was the most feminist man of his age in his lucid periods between bouts of booze and drugs, that has nothing to do with this painting. To see it as radical at all – either politically or aesthetically – depends on a massive ignorance of art history.The Guerrilla Girls chose Ingres’ Odalisque as the embodiment of the oppressive nude in their poster asking: “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?” So what makes that painting the quintessence of patriarchy, while Modigliani’s 1917 restaging is said to somehow subvert gender roles?There’s nothing new in the way Modigliani’s model looks out of the painting, either. Her gaze is nothing like as confrontational as that of Manet’s Olympia, painted in 1863. Nudes have been looking directly out of paintings, capturing the beholder’s eye, holding the gaze, for centuries. Titian’s Venus of Urbino did it back in the 1530s. Not many people would claim Titian as a feminist – but his nude is not a dreamy classical statue either. She looks at you directly because she’s offering sex. That, surely, is what Modigliani’s nude is also doing. Both are fantasy women proposing fantasy love.Modigliani is easy to look at and think about, so his art will aways be popular. Yet it will never quite be in the highest league. Last night’s non-world record proves that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f380edf92fd3fca2ef4f16648f6eecb834c7b4ba/0_1048_2847_1707/master/2847.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d20f015d581d1895211b4954e11578d","title":"last samurai london photography fair in pictures","story":"A collection of rare photographs of samurai presented by Daniella Dangoor is being exhibited at The London Photograph Fair.

It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next levelHelsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next level“A library card was the first thing that was mine, that I had ever owned,” says Nasima Razmyar. The daughter of a former Afghan diplomat, Razmyar arrived in Finland with her family in 1992 as a refugee fleeing political unrest. Unable to speak the language, with scant resources, and trying to make sense of the strange new city she found herself in, she was stunned to discover she was entitled to a library card that would grant her books – for free. Her appreciation of the privilege has not faded: “I still have that library card in my wallet today,” she says proudly.Today, Razmyar is deputy mayor of Helsinki, and ready to champion the institution that has given her so much – starting with the construction of Oodi, the city’s new central library, due to open in December. She is not alone in her passion for libraries. “Finland is a country of readers,” declared the country’s UK ambassador Päivi Luostarinen recently, and it’s hard to argue with her. In 2016 the UN named Finland the world’s most literate nation, and Finns are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of public libraries – the country’s 5.5m million people borrow close to 68m books a year.Oodi – Ode in English – is more than a sober monument to civic pride. Commissioned as part of Finland’s celebration of a century of independence, the library is no mere book repository. “I think Finland could not have given a better gift to the people. It symbolises the significance of learning and education, which have been fundamental factors for Finland’s development and success,” says Razmyar. Libraries are seen as the visible face of the Finnish belief in education, equality and good citizenship. “There’s strong belief in education for all,” says Hanna Harris, director of Archinfo Finland and Mind-building’s commissioner. “There is an appreciation of active citizenship – the idea that it is something that everyone is entitled to. Libraries embody that strongly,” she adds.Those feelings of pride in the equality of opportunity offered by the city’s new library are echoed by the site chosen for Oodi: directly opposite parliament. “I think there is no other actor that could stand in front of the grounds of democracy like the public library does,” says Razmyar. “It’s remarkable that when standing on the open balcony of the library people are looking straight into the parliament and standing on the same level.”But Oodi isn’t the only Helsinki library to cause excitement. “Töölö library is one of my favourites,” says Harris. “It’s set in a park and has a rooftop balcony. Recently my colleagues and I went down there and there was a queue outside the doors – on a regular weekday morning, there was a queue at 9am to get in.”Perhaps a clue to the Finnish enthusiasm for libraries comes from the fact that they offer far more than books. While many libraries worldwide provide internet access and other services, libraries in cities and towns across Finland have expanded their brief to include lending e-publications, sports equipment, power tools and other “items of occasional use”. One library in Vantaa even offers karaoke.These spaces are not designed to be dusty temples to literacy. They are vibrant, well-thought-out spaces actively trying to engage the urban communities who use them. The library in Maunula, a northern Helsinki suburb, has a doorway that leads directly to a supermarket – a striking and functional decision which, along with its adult education centre and youth services section, was partly down to the fact that it was designed with input from locals. Oodi, however, will go even further: in addition to its core function as a library, it will boast a cafe, restaurant, public balcony, cinema, audiovisual recording studios and a makerspace with 3D printers. A sauna was apparently considered, but seems not to have made the final cut.This ersity is key, argues Razmyar. “Libraries must reach out to the new generations. The world is changing – so libraries are changing too. People need places to meet, to work, to develop their digital skills.”The site and design of Helsinki’s new library are certainly striking, but perhaps the most impressive thing about it is the lack of public opposition to such a costly project. “People are looking forward to Oodi. It’s not been contentious: people are excited about it across the board,” says Archinfo director Harris. “It will be important to daily life here in Helsinki.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45d740e5fb1cce10f64f09fda0bbdc37d1fb615/257_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3d7580e02ef4230ecd491ee744a1333","title":"price natural world destruction natural capital","story":"This powder is the monetary valuation of the natural world. Through the market, we can avoid conflict and hard choices, laws and policies, by replacing political decisions with economic calculations.Almost all official documents on environmental issues are now peppered with references to “natural capital” and to the Natural Capital Committee, the Laputian body the government has created to price the living world and develop a set of “national natural capital accounts”. The government admits that “at present we cannot robustly value everything we wish to in economic terms wildlife being a particular challenge”. Hopefully, such gaps can soon be filled, so we’ll know exactly how much a primrose is worth.The government argues that without a price, the living world is accorded no value, so irrational decisions are made. By costing nature, you ensure that it commands the investment and protection that other forms of capital attract. This thinking is based on a series of extraordinary misconceptions. Even the name reveals a confusion: natural capital is a contradiction in terms. Capital is properly understood as the human-made segment of wealth that is deployed in production to create further financial returns. Concepts such as natural capital, human capital or social capital can be used as metaphors or analogies, though even these are misleading. But the 25-year plan defines natural capital as “the air, water, soil and ecosystems that support all forms of life”. In other words, nature is capital. In reality, natural wealth and human-made capital are neither comparable nor interchangeable. If the soil is washed off the land, we cannot grow crops on a bed of derivatives.A similar fallacy applies to price. Unless something is redeemable for money, a pound or dollar sign placed in front of it is senseless: price represents an expectation of payment, in accordance with market rates. In pricing a river, a landscape or an ecosystem, either you are lining it up for sale, in which case the exercise is sinister, or you are not, in which case it is meaningless.Still more deluded is the expectation that we can defend the living world through the mindset that’s destroying it. The notions that nature exists to serve us that its value consists of the instrumental benefits we can extract that this value can be measured in cash terms and that what can’t be measured does not matter, have proved lethal to the rest of life on Earth. The way we name things and think about them – in other words the mental frames we use – helps determine the way we treat them.As the cognitive linguist George Lakoff points out, when you use the frames and language of your opponents, you don’t persuade them to adopt your point of view. Instead you adopt theirs, while strengthening their resistance to your objectives. Lakoff argues that the key to political success is to promote your own values, rather than appease the mindset you contest.The natural capital agenda reinforces the notion that nature has no value unless you can extract cash from it. Dieter Helm, who chairs the government’s preposterous committee, makes this point explicit: the idea that nature has intrinsic value, independent of what humans can take from it, he says, is “dangerous”. But this dangerous idea has been the motivating force of all successful environmental campaigns.The commonest response to the case I’m making is that we can use both intrinsic and extrinsic arguments for protecting nature. The natural capital agenda, its defenders say, is “an additional weapon in the fight to protect the countryside”. But it does not add, it subtracts. As the philosopher Michael Sandel argues in What Money Can’t Buy, market values crowd out non-market values. Markets change the meaning of the things we discuss, replacing moral obligations with commercial relationships. This corrupts and degrades our intrinsic values and empties public life of moral argument.It is also, his examples show, counterproductive: financial incentives undermine our motivation to act for the public good. “Altruism, generosity, solidarity and civic spirit are … like muscles that develop and grow stronger with exercise. One of the defects of the market-driven society is it lets these virtues languish.” So who will resist this parched, destructive mindset? Not, it seems, the big conservation groups. In this month’s BBC Wildlife magazine, Tony Juniper – who in other respects is an admirable defender of the living world – says he will use his new post as head of campaigns at WWF to promote the natural capital agenda.Perhaps he is unaware that in 2014 WWF commissioned research to test this approach. It showed that when people were reminded of the intrinsic value of nature, they were more likely to defend the living planet and support WWF≈than when they were exposed to financial arguments. It also discovered that using both arguments together produced the same result as just the financial one: the natural capital agenda undermined people’s intrinsic motivation.Has this been forgotten? Sometimes I wonder whether anything is learned in conservation, or whether the big NGOs are for ever destined to follow a circular track, endlessly repeating their mistakes. Rather than contributing to the alienation and disenchantment the commercial mindset fosters, they should help to enrich our relationship with the living world.The natural capital agenda is the definitive expression of our disengagement from the living world. First we lose our wildlife and natural wonders. Then we lose our connections with what remains of life on Earth. Then we lose the words that described what we once knew. Then we call it capital and give it a price. This approach is morally wrong, intellectually vacuous, emotionally alienating and self-defeating.Those of us who are motivated by love for the living planet should not hesitate to say so. Never underestimate the power of intrinsic values. They inspire every struggle for a better world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43a0ed2bb317bcdacb7247e73b08c90e9af482c/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3f36ef35a3cfdb66ee6b0e4be6dfbe","title":"what have the royals done for the arts meghan markle prince harry wedding","story":"From the RSC to the ROH, Britain’s most prestigious arts institutions are all by royal appointment. But as Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle, is it goodbye Royal Variety Show and hello Royal Reprezent FM?The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle means many things to many people, but, while loyalists are bagging their picnic spots and unpacking the union-jack party plates, some hard-pressed arts organisations will be taking a longer view.Once the party is over, reality strikes: a royal wedding means the admittance of a new member into “the firm” – and for them, a lifetime of public patronage. It has already been announced that Markle will become a partner in the Royal Foundation, set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 as an umbrella for a clutch of charities. Besides youth work, the foundation’s portfolio is dominated by the princes’ preoccupations with the armed forces and conservation, while the charities that will be picked for Markle’s inidual support will – in Palace parlance – “reflect Miss Markle’s own interests”.The National Portrait Gallery and the art therapy organisation, Art Room, were among the first four charities to be chosen for her future sister-in-law, Kate. A clue as to where Markle’s interests might lead her – as a cosmopolitan mixed-race TV actor, with avowedly feminist views – lies in the couple’s second official engagement in January. It took them (on their own request) to the “youth-led” radio station Reprezent FM, in Brixton, south London, which is credited with launching the careers of a galaxy of DJs and grime stars, including this year’s Brit award-winner Stormzy.But what does royal patronage actually mean for the arts? For Reprezent, which was saved from closure three years ago by a crowd-funding appeal, even a one-off visit has been an overwhelming experience. “To be honest, we’re hunkered down. We’ve been inundated with requests, and there’s been a three-line whip across the board not to talk to the press about anything at all,” said their phone operator.Over the next four years, the specialist graduate college – whose alumni include Sylvia Pankhurst, Ian Dury, David Hockney and Tracey Emin – will expand to a new campus in Battersea and increase its student numbers from 1,900 to 3,000. It already recruits from 74 countries and the rapid growth both in numbers and costs will increasingly involve looking overseas, where the word “royal” is an invaluable calling card.“The royal connection has always been hugely beneficial when being seen on the international stage,” said a spokeswoman, “so we are no different from other great institutions such as the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Rada, Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company.” As Andy Hillier, editor of the charity sector magazine Third Sector, points out, the two great advantages of a royal association are publicity and trust. “For smaller organisations, the biggest advantage is publicity because it can be very difficult to draw attention to yourself. For larger organisations, the publicity benefit might not be so obvious unless you’re staging a big event, but trust is a big issue at the moment, and if you have a royal patron there is an assumption that there’s a royal stamp of approval and that you will have been thoroughly vetted.”The twists and turns of royal support are as bewildering as the Hampton Court maze. Presidencies and patronships come with varying, and not always consistent, levels of commitment. As a “royal visitor” Prince Charles is unlikely to visit the RCA much, though it hopes to profit from a hook-up with the Royal Drawing School, which he co-founded in 2000 as the Prince’s Drawing School, but which only went on to earn its “Royal” appellation in 2014. The announcement of this upgrade, by an institution that could be seen as the result of a hobbyist’s anachronistic obsession with “observational drawing”, is revealing: “With this name change, the Royal Drawing School joins the Royal Academy (1768), the Royal College of Music (1882), the Royal College of Art (1896) the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1920) and the Royal Ballet School (1956), as a member of the small circle of prestigious, world-renowned arts education institutions to bear the Royal title. It is the first such institution to be granted the name since the Royal Ballet School, which received its title in 1956 – the fourth year of the reign of HM Queen Elizabeth II.”The Royal College of Art’s headquarters – along with the Royal College of Music – are in an area of London once known as Albertopolis, in memory of the royal spouse who played a bigger role than others in the development of the UK’s enduring cultural capital.Prince Albert was the driving force behind the Great Exhibition, staged in a custom-built Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851 with the not inconsiderable ambition, according to Queen Victoria, “to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world”.Despite the disapproval of critics including Karl Marx, who deplored it as an “emblem of the capitalist fetishism of commodities”, the self-financing extravaganza, which is said to have been visited by six million people, turned in a profit big enough to buy a swath of land in South Kensington for a new cultural quarter that would include the three great national museums on Exhibition Road and the Royal Albert Hall.It’s a mark of the decline of royal power that, while Albert could influence the shape of a city, Prince Charles has had to content himself with a model village, incarnating his ardent architectural philosophy in the Beatrix Potter cottages and Disneyland castles of Poundbury, a new town that was planned and developed at his command on 400 acres of Dorset land from 1989.But, though the capacities of this century’s royal patrons might be reduced, their credibility has greatly improved since the late 1980s, when National Theatre director Richard Eyre fought a valiant rearguard action against being landed with a royal charter. “The ‘Royal National’ nonsense has burst like a fat blister,” he wrote in his diary in June 1988. “I haven’t yet had to publicly defend it, and am not looking forward to having to lie in public … Neal Ascherson writes to me that ‘everyone is looking to you to stop this royal nonsense’.”Thirty years on, Ascherson – a leading Scottish author and academic – feels just as strongly. “I’m not a fanatical anti-monarchist,” he says. “What I fancy is a country with republican institutions which, if people wanted, could have an ornamental bobble-king on top, like the royal republic of Norway.” Ironically, given her propaganda wars with “the firm”, the change in public opinion was partly due to Princess Diana’s touchy-feely support of charities working in previously stigmatised fields such as support for people with Aids and leprosy. Hillier points out that the younger generation have continued that tradition by extending royal patronage into mental health, “which is not an area the royal family has supported in the past”. He cites their support for the Heads Together campaign – encouraging people to be more open about mental illness – which involves a partnership with existing charities to challenge this social taboo. In today’s celebrity culture, part of their value is their ability to pull in showbiz stars – as Prince William did for Heads Together with Lady Gaga last year. Their four-minute Facetime chat, filmed in Kensington Palace and Lady Gaga’s Hollywood kitchen, was part of a series of celebrity heart-to-hearts that are now on YouTube.But to what extent do these enthusiasms extend beyond celebrity to the arts themselves? Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has concentrated on reading charities, with patronages including the National Literacy Trust and Book Trust. At the more glitzy end she’s become a regular at the Man Booker prize dinner, and will be hosting its 50th anniversary celebrations in July with a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles – who has never sold himself as a great reader, though he’s known to love a spot of Shakespeare – discreetly backs (and personally attends) the Boswell book festival in the Scottish countryside. The boutique fiesta of biography and memoir takes place in Dumfries House – a Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that he rescued and restored, and which recently joined his School of Traditional Arts as part of the Prince’s Foundation.Prince Charles has never been one for public displays of emotion, but it won’t have escaped fans of Markle’s best-known TV role – paralegal Rachel in the series Suits – that one of her strongest suits is a capacity to emote to order. Social deprivation is likely to feature in her charity choices, with the arts as enablers. While Dumfries House is at the Chippendale end of royal patronages, it’s a fair bet that Markle’s furnishings will be more street than five-star suite.

Earlier this year an unprecedented joint inquiry by four committees of MPs described it as a “national health emergency”. In the report, the “super committee” was scathing about the government’s clean air plans which have been judged illegal three times in the high court. The latest proposal, rejected by the high court earlier this year, was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.London’s air pollution crisis is responsible for 9,000 early deaths each year.

This giant straw hat is absurd to look at on a catwalk, but worn on a sandy beach, and photographed from behind, it encapsulates everything that summer is – and everything you want to be when you wear it. In short, to be seen while not being seen, ideally on holiday.It has also kickstarted what looks like the defining Instagram trend of the summer – hats with brims of alarming diameter. At Sensi, they are large and paper-braided, while versions at Topshop and Off White, although smaller, come with a wide brim as flat as the Norfolk Broads. At Missoni, they are shaped like an exaggerated wimple. At Gucci, they tie under the chin with a ribbon. At Delpozo, they are more bow-like than hat-like, but the sentiment remains.Dig deeper, and oversized hats serve the same seenunseen purpose on celebrities. Melania Trump hid beneath a white one designed by Hervé Pierre when the Macrons visited the White House. Justin Bieber dodged speculation over his love life in a straw version as he took a “meditative hike” through the hills.Jacquemus is the French label for cool French women. The Jacquemus girl, the handsome, oft-tanned designer Simon Porte Jacquemus once told the , “is not Parisian, and that is important. She is French, and French girls are not elegant, they are raw, casual, spontaneous.” It is also a label that likes to play with scale when it comes to accessories. His tiny Le Sac Chiquito handbags are the size of your fist, yet are the It bag of summer 2018. The La Bomba hat is the size of a manta ray, making it impossible to transport, yet it is long sold out and, even if it wasn’t, is comically antisocial, shielding not just its wearer from the sun but anyone on the same stretch of beach. And yet ...Hats have become heavy with meaning, and a good way to signal an allegiance – be it Trump’s red baseball cap or the pink pussy hats. If autumn 2017 was dominated by baseball caps worn by people who wouldn’t normally wear baseball caps, then other kinds of hats are successfully revised each season, and do the same job. See berets, stetsons and, now, straw hats. Much like Lenny Kravitz’s famously large scarf a few years ago, hats are the quickest way to signal a “don’t look at me, but, like, do” level of fame.If Instagram 2017 was all about tropical kitschiness, starring flamingos and cacti among other twee nostalgic tics, then this is the summer of the giant parody straw hat. Some shade intended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5090a92b01d584b80a163b26557daef9ff3743d/0_339_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42739aee34b229c28403a628567788e1","title":"asako i ii review japanese romcom flips gaze ryusuke hamaguchi","story":"Ryūsuke Hamaguchi’s earnest romance switches things up by having a woman obsessed with a man’s beauty and then falling for his doubleHere is a quibblingly titled movie from Japan that turns out to be an odd doppelganger romance of YA earnestness, directed and co-written by Ryūsuke Hamaguchi, adapted from the novel by Tomoka Shibasaki. It has a kind of counter-Vertigo theme, a tale of mirror-image obsession, but where this kind of thing is usually about the possessive male gaze and passively enigmatic female beauty, here things are reversed. Asako is about the female gaze, and male beauty.Erika Karata plays Asako, a college student in Kyoto, demure, hardworking, self-effacing and possessed of a doll-like beauty. One day she attends a photographic exhibition and outside chances across Baku (Masahiro Higashide), a fellow student who is hardly less pretty than she is: cool, careless, like the solo breakout star of a boyband. Baku waltzes up to Asako, chats a little and then presumes to kiss her. Within an instant, she is in love, and they are an item, to the dismay of Asako’s loyal pal Haruyo (Sairi Itô), who knows about Baku’s irresponsible-heartbreaker reputation. One day, Baku does precisely what everyone feared: he wanders off and capriciously vanishes from Asako’s life, having evidently dropped out of school.Cut to two years later, and Asako is working at a coffee shop in Tokyo, which does outside catering at business events. While turning up to clear away the cups and thermos canisters at some conference, she is astonished to see Ryôhei, a nice-looking but rather boring suit-wearing young salaryman. He is the dead spit of super-glam Baku, like his dull twin, and is of course played by the same actor. She is mesmerised by the resemblance there is no one around from her home town to confirm her astonishment, and even after chatting to him and scraping up a friendship, she can’t bring herself to confess this deeply strange coincidence to him. And so she embarks on a relationship with poor, unknowing Ryôhei, based on his poignant resemblance to someone much cooler, much sexier and more fascinating who has disappeared like a dream. But then, just as she has forgotten about Baku and is perfectly happy with Ryôhei, and has formed a happy circle of friends in Tokyo based on getting to know him, she sees a very familiar gorgeous face on a billboard and everything is back up in the air.I wondered if a certain Hitchcockian twist was coming the audience’s way. And you can’t help wondering. People watching a realistic film, set in the recognisable modern world – and not in, say, the magical-twin world of Shakespearian comedy – can’t be blamed for demanding some sort of explanation for a resemblance so exact that the film is using the same actor. And indeed it is great work from Higashide.Well, I’m not sure that Asako I \u0026amp II either furnishes an explanation, or styles out the lack of one. But it is an arresting metaphor for a certain phenomenon: settling. Asako wanted sexy love-god Baku, but settled for dependable, reliable Ryôhei in the idealised romantic image she carries around. And in fact it is Ryôhei who is entitled to consider himself as having the supernaturally ideal life: he’s extremely handsome, as well as being nice. But that is not how these things work. We all carry around with us a high school or college memory of heartbreak, and thus preserve around that culprit – always accessible in these social media times – a false romantic cachet. This is an amusing essay in amorous delusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de222efac3e6f9f13488d73f607c41c7922b71f/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24038419075b74dc8a0b2fc0fb49acd6","title":"vomitive pathetic lars von trier film prompts mass walkouts at cannes","story":"More than 100 people said to have exited early from a screening for The House That Jack Built, which features scenes of duckling mutilation and child killingDanish director Lars Von Trier’s much-anticipated return to Cannes has resulted – with some predictability – in controversy, as a screening of his new film The House That Jack Built was met with mass walkouts.The blackly comic thriller, which stars Matt Dillon and Uma Thurman, follows the murder spree of a serial killer over the course of several decades. Advance word on the film suggested that it would feature scenes of sadistic violence and brutality, with Cannes director Thierry Frémaux saying that it featured “a subject so controversial” that it could only appear in an out-of-competition slot at the festival.That advance billing seems to have been lived up to, with Variety’s Ramin Setoodeh reporting more than 100 people leaving the cinema prematurely due to the film’s “disgusting” content. “Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic,” wrote one attendee on Twitter, while entertainment reporter Roger Friedman described it as a “vile movie” that “should not have been made”. “He mutilates Riley Keough, he mutilates children... and we are all there in formal dress expected to watch it?” another viewer told Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan. Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela also left the screening early, stating that “seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment”.The scene which seems to have prompted the majority of walkouts is one in which Dillon’s character shoots two children at a family picnic in the head with a rifle. In another Keogh’s character is seen having her breast sliced off, while a flashback scene shows a child removing a duckling’s leg with a pair of pliers. Archive footage from concentration camps is also shown.Von Trier was making his first appearance on the Croisette since being declared “persona not grata” by the festival over a 2011 press conference in which he joked about sympathising with the Nazis. At the time the Cannes board declared the director’s comments “unacceptable, intolerable, and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival”. However, last month Cannes overturned the ban, with Frémaux saying that it was a “punishment that was disproportionate and that had lasted long enough”. That decision was greeted negatively in some quarters, with critics pointing to allegations made by the musician Björk, who claimed that Von Trier had sexually harassed her on the set of his film Dancer in the Dark. Von Trier denies the allegations.Critical response to The House That Jack Built has been largely negative. In a two-star review, the ’s Peter Bradshaw wrote that the film was “an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness that was every bit as exasperating as I had feared”, though he did admit that he was impressed by its “spectacular horror finale”. Also giving the film two stars was the ’s Robbie Collin, who wrote it “feels like way too much and nowhere near enough”, while, in an F-grade review, The Playlist’s Jessica Kiang described it as “misogynistic” and “irredeemably unpleasant”.Not everyone seems to have been appalled by The House That Jack Built, however. Setoodeh reports that the film received a standing ovation at the Cannes premiere, which prompted someone sitting near him to declare: “They’ll clap for anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeefdcd79e319bbc3ee471fcbf14a5996291578f/1157_198_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1399a177d5a77a17293d006c6468972","title":"margot kidder a life in pictures","story":"The 69-year-old actor, known for roles in Superman and The Amityville Horror, has died of throat cancer.

The Arsenal midfielder, who has not played for his country since Euro 2016, started only 12 Premier League games in the season just finished and a historically fragile body may have counted against him given the demands of a tournament.In leaving out Hart, Southgate has chosen to ignore his most experienced player. The Manchester City goalkeeper, who has spent the season on loan at West Ham, was told on Monday in a phone-call from the England manager that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals despite Southgate having considered the 31-year-old his first choice for much of his tenure. Hart won his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil in November but Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland started the friendlies in March and have usurped him in the pecking order.The suggestion had been Hart would still travel to the World Cup as an experienced third-choice – only Gary Cahill and Jermain Defoe of Southgate’s recent selections have more than 50 caps, with neither expected to make the cut for Russia – and would have been willing to fulfil that role, but his toils at club level appear to have counted against him.He has endured an indifferent spell on-loan at West Ham this season, losing his place towards the end of November to Adrián and starting only 19 league games in total. He regained his place after a 4-1 defeat at Swansea in March, but there were subsequent high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke. His last appearance was a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April.Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is the likeliest to replace Hart in the 23-man squad, which Southgate will reveal on Wednesday.Delph’s inclusion follows a season in which he has been successfully remodelled as a left-back at City by Pep Guardiola. The 28-year-old has been more naturally a central midfielder and brings versatility to Southgate’s squad. The left-back Ryan Bertrand has been left out but Ashley Young will be part of the squad.The Burnley defender James Tarkowski, who has one cap, is understood to be on the standby list. Southgate is expected to select Phil Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f5fe466233c05c9ea48c1b127d3e736b284c94/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ee75f657d9effe1353bf093f91034c","title":"mikel arteta favourite to become arsenal manager replace wenger","story":"Mikel Arteta is the strong favourite to be appointed as successor to Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, with productive talks having progressed between his camp and the club.Conversations are so advanced that Arteta is giving thought to the people he might want in his backroom team.

But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, orced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette.Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride.Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.”One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes.In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.”Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.”It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights.Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle.Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.”Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone).Any knotty family matters – orced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb1562241815b3fe99e3f50363d6960ac4cf8f0/487_1306_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d49b7055982eb4b58c9648f858553f","title":"nigel slater bresaola peas and feta recipe","story":"A fresh and sprightly piquant spring saladPut the juice of half a lemon, 6 tbsp of olive oil, 8 mint leaves and a small handful of parsley leaves into a blender, season with a little salt and process to a thick, bright green dressing.Slice a couple of medium-sized tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a serving plate then moisten them with a spoonful of the dressing.

Swap the bresaola for thin slices of smoked trout, which will work beautifully with the peas, and include a little thinly sliced cucumber, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9080d2f5402bd879de0010f742822c97379f0c4/0_1179_5493_3295/master/5493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5e0b63163ae20e763692d690fb53f7","title":"joan armatrading webchat not too far away","story":"The songwriter, whose new album is Not Too Far Away, weighs in on Post Malone, recording with Queen and learning to play on a £3 guitar in a webchatThank you very much for your questions that you\u0027ve put to me - very interesting (some boring!) - it was a very nice way to spend the afternoon talking to you.Loved your gig on Graham Norton last week.R u free to do Eurovision next year?I think I\u0027m busy that day... although I love watching it.First of all, thank you for 42 years of your soul-expanding music. I came to the JA party a wee-bit late but, hey, I found your music in a record store in Helena, Montana. I have followed you ever since, loving every album and seeing you in concert four times. What a gift. This new album sounds as fresh as that first album I found in 1976. Is there anything unique to the writing experience andor its inspiration of this album that you would like to share?Yes, my first album was 1972, thank you for finding me in 1976! The uniqueness of this album is that I wrote all of the words first before I wrote any of the music. The other interesting thing about this album is the order of the songs on the album is exactly in the order that I wrote the songs.I believe the opening line of Love and Affection to be one of the greatest ever penned. Generally, the lyric in the whole song is nothing short of sublime. Thank you so much for your artistry. Coupled with Down to Zero you have perfectly soundtracked this young man’s forays into life and love.Have you ever strayed from Ovation? Beautiful instruments with amazing mid- and bass- tones. Which models do you play? Some are going to be manufactured in the US again. Any perceived differences over the years, countries of manufacture, or species of wood?Ovations are great guitars. I\u0027ve been playing Ovations since 1975 or so. Great tone, they were being manufactured in America when I started using them - in fact, I was given a special medal from Ovation because I was one of the first people using their guitars, and there was a whole ceremony that the whole factory came to. As I say, I\u0027ve been using them for all this time, but on this album I decided to play a Martin guitar, and this tour, for the first time since I started using Ovations, will be on a Martin guitar. And it\u0027s very different - everything about it is different. An Ovation is something that you hold very close to you. It feels very near to your body whereas a Martin feels quite distant, it\u0027s a boxy shape that you feel as if you\u0027re playing at arms\u0027 length, and it\u0027s taken me quite a while to get used to playing it, it\u0027s so different! Just felt like a change.I saw you in Leicester many, many years ago. One of the highlights of my student days. How did you get to be such a different voice?This is how I was born. I\u0027ve done nothing to it, nothing for it.Having studied for a history degree, do you think history is a kind of mystery? Would that inform any compositions? PS: Me Myself I is super.I have never written a song because I did a history degree, but history is very interesting and very important, and everybody, whether they know it or not, is interested in history. Any money you\u0027ve asked your parents or grandparents at some point what they did when they were young - well, that\u0027s history.I’ve read you left school at 15 to support your family, working in a tool factory. Was music an escape from all this? Was it perhaps the associated angst that drove your inspiration? What barriers to progressing your music-making did you face, coming from this background?I left school at 15, yes I left to help my family, and I worked in the office of the tool factory - not on the factory floor - as a typist and comptometer operator. I started writing when I was 14 because my mother bought a piano and put it in the front room, thought it was a great piece of furniture, but I was born to write so writing wasn\u0027t an escape, it was a calling. It was what I was put on this earth to do. I don\u0027t know anything about barriers.I heard that Johnny Rotten is a fan of yours. Are you a fan of his?I love the Sex Pistols! I thought the Sex Pistols were great. He brought a passion, whether made up or real, you certainly saw the passion, and it worked. And they got people talking, and I think they got people thinking, maybe we need to make some changes. I think the Sex Pistols were probably necessary to the music business. They were on my label, and the chaos when they were in the A\u0026ampM offices was unbelievable!In hindsight, did you know what you were looking for in all your songs of longing, desire and isolation? Was it romantic love or connectedness or what?I think the way the songs work is that they are trying to help people to connect to each other and perhaps to explain to each other emotions that they\u0027re going through. So all the things you\u0027ve mentioned are things that people go through - longing, desire, isolation, romance, lost love, found love - and I try in my songs to explain some of those in any way that I can. Also in any way that will make people connect to the songs and to each other.Embarrassed to say that I really only found your music after seeing The Tempest in the wonderful Shakespeare Trilogy. It’s now in my regular rotation. Is there any chance at all that you might do any concerts in America? I would love to see you but in any case thanks so much for all of your contributions!Thank you for enjoying the Tempest, I loved writing the music to such a wonderful play, and the cast were brilliant in their performances every night. I\u0027ve been touring America since 1972! Have toured after every album - this is my 21st album - and I will be on tour in America at the end of this month, May.Any tips for writing music?You can start with the words, the music, the piano, the guitar, a riff - that\u0027s it, just as long as you start - and finish - that\u0027s the main thing. Don\u0027t start and stop halfway!I saw you perform at Manchester University in 1975 in support of Nils Lofgren. I bought you a drink afterwards, and you gave me your Nils badge, which I still have. Do you still drink lemonade?I have drunk lemonade since 1975, funnily enough. And very nice it is too. Nils is great, he\u0027s another great guitarist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71bb366b5fa8b7fdd43daba3ae5353fd6dfe16a/21_0_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae7d9af004f4e1f3a121bd363177b58","title":"pessimism about customs impasse after rees mogg remarks","story":"Rees-Mogg has said hard Brexiters will not back down, as subcommittee prepares to meetTheresa May’s inner Brexit cabinet is preparing to meet again, with ministers pessimistic about breaking the customs deadlock after Jacob Rees-Mogg said hard Brexit MPs would not back down.Ahead of the subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg, who heads the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, said he was not minded to take a more conciliatory position. “If we were to do so it would completely undermine the heart of why we voted to leave, rendering our almost-reclaimed sovereignty a myth,” he said.He repeated calls for Britain to walk away from the negotiations if the options May gave the European commission were rejected. “The UK will simply have to leave with no deal because the referendum result must be upheld,” he said. “Democracy is the backbone of established political societies, it fosters stability and fairness and cannot be treated so disdainfully.”Writing in the Daily , Rees-Mogg said May “ought not to take Brussels too seriously about the Irish question” when seeking a customs deal. “The commission hides behind faux concern for the Irish border undermining the single market ... We will not impose a border. If there is a deal to be done about the border it will be precisely that: a deal. Nonetheless, if one side keeps refusing to bargain, no deal will be struck.”The intervention came after May held private meetings with dozens of Conservative backbench MPs to try to explain the two options for customs arrangements with the EU. She and Rees-Mogg are reported to have clashed over the consequences for the Irish border during their meeting.The inner Brexit cabinet meets again on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the two rival plans. May still faces having to deal with a significant split among ministers over whether to back a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border.Conservative MPs were invited to five separate sessions at the Department for Exiting the European Union, where May made introductory remarks and took questions. Her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then gave a “neutral, technical” presentation of both options, with MPs given the chance to press him further on the detail afterwards. A Brexiter source said the presentation had been “neutral to the point of being incoherent”.David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the cabinet would “test proposals to destruction” and denied the arguments were coming too late in the process. “We’ve been very focused on other aspects of Brexit, agreeing the withdrawal agreement, the implementation period. The EU themselves set a timescale to discuss these issues and it’s right that we’re focusing on it now,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We are focusing on it in a way that ensures that we get it right, that we test proposals to destruction.” Asked if that phrasing meant he agreed with Boris Johnson’s assessment that the customs partnership was “crazy”, Mundell said: “I agree with cabinet collective responsibility, we’ll look in detail at proposals that have been worked through by the sub-committees.”Before the full Brexit subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, May also faced pressure from the former John Lewis boss Andy Street, who won the West Midlands mayoralty in a surprise win over Labour last year.Street, a Tory remainer, said his region’s car industry was facing an uncertain future without a comprehensive customs deal. His remarks echo those made last week by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who favours the customs partnership option.“As the cabinet examines the different systems for administering customs after Brexit, it must ensure that whatever the final arrangements are, they sustain the manufacturing renaissance we have seen in the West Midlands,” Street wrote in the Times.He said technology would be “part of the solution” but said trade flow was crucial. “If the technology doesn’t work for car parts at Dover or Felixstowe, if there are big delays, new checks or burdensome processes to claim back customs paid, costs will go up and companies will struggle,” he said. “If we get this wrong, we will see the unintended destruction of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry in the West Midlands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/030f7ee707922cab3a4e74f0713deca1b2c2c4de/0_452_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dcda2fa3a7af6739f10adc3d802ebdb","title":"unite and momentum back rival candidates in lewisham byelection","story":"Final selection hustings to choose Labour candidate expected to be a ‘real tough battle’ for the leftUnite and Momentum are expected to back rival candidates for the battle to become Lewisham East’s next Labour MP, the  has learned.Momentum’s national coordinating group is likely to back Lewisham councillor Sakina Sheikh, a former student campaigner who has close links with the grassroots group. Unite has already formally backed Islington councillor Claudia Webbe, a member of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) and a former adviser to Ken Livingstone.A Momentum source suggested the group wanted to back a candidate with local credentials. “The local Momentum heavily backs Sakina and it feels like she will get the national backing, as they are keen to make sure it’s a local candidate with the endorsement of local members,” the source said.However, Lewisham Momentum itself is split, with a recent AGM ending in a dispute. A Facebook post on the group’s account on Tuesday shared details of a campaign phone bank for Webbe.Unite announced on Tuesday it was backing Webbe, the more experienced candidate, saying she would be “a huge asset in parliament”. The trade union said Webbe was “a lifelong socialist who tirelessly fights the corner of working people, and for justice for those let down by our political system”.Two other candidates have also been shortlisted, councillor Brenda Dacres, who stood unsuccessfully to be Lewisham mayor earlier this year, and Janet Daby, Lewisham’s deputy mayor. Lewisham East’s local party is controlled by party centrists, who are likely to organise for Daby or Dacres. A Momentum source said the seat could be “a real tough battle” for the left in the local party.The final selection hustings for the seat, which has a 21,000 Labour majority, will take place on Saturday, when party members will vote for their preferred candidate to fight the by-election in June. The process was slowed down following an email campaign by grassroots party members who felt the initial timetable was too rushed.Ian McKenzie, the chair of Lewisham East CLP, said: “I’m absolutely delighted that the NEC has listened to local members and given us a say on who is on the shortlist, so members have a genuine choice. It looks like Jeremy Corbyn’s member-led democracy actually means something.”Two of the four shortlisted candidates, Daby and Dacres, were on a list published unilaterally by the local party, but which has no formal role in drawing up the shortlist. Centrist activists in Lewisham had feared the NEC, on which Corbyn’s backers now have a majority, would only allow them to choose between candidates from the left wing of the party.The byelection was called after the resignation of Heidi Alexander, the former shadow health secretary, who quit to take up a role as deputy mayor for transport under the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at City Hall. Alexander has been co-chair of the Labour campaign for the single market.Corbyn paid tribute to her at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in Westminster on Tuesday night. A Labour source said Corbyn had joked that he would lobby Alexander in her new role for a new bus stop in his Islington North constituency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ce53b84394f00cde7da2c5257da687d1c4e232/0_127_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31b7271d15504a159c42c0bfd62f8b6","title":"buttler and bess are surprises in england test squad as vince dropped","story":"Jos Buttler and Dom Bess are the standout names in the first squad picked by Ed Smith, England’s new head selector, for the opening Test in the series against Pakistan next week.Buttler, who last played a Test in December 2016, has been selected as a specialist batsman after England’s struggles in recent months while Bess, the uncapped Somerset off-spinner, benefited from the untimely broken thumb suffered by his team-mate Jack Leach at Taunton on Tuesday.In that same match, James Vince struck a double hundred for Hampshire the day before the selectors met at Lord’s to finalise the 12-strong squad but it was not enough to convince the panel that he should retain his place for the first Test against Pakistan. There was a reprieve, however, for the opener Mark Stoneman, despite low scores in the championship for Surrey so far.The 27-year-old Buttler is a mainstay of the one-day and Twenty20 sides but played the last of his 18 Tests in India during England’s 4-0 series defeat in 2016 and is still searching for a maiden Test century. A failure to take his chance in India saw him fall down the pecking order again and he was overlooked entirely for the 2017-18 Ashes, when Ben Foakes travelled as the back-up wicketkeeper to Jonny Bairstow. Buttler is again in scintillating form in limited overs cricket, however, having recorded five consecutive 50s for the Rajahstan Royals in the IPL. Smith, who met his fellow selectors Mick Newell and Angus Fraser, the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and the Test captain, Joe Root, earlier on Tuesday, said: “Jos Buttler is an outstanding talent. The selection panel feels that this is the perfect moment to reintroduce Jos to Test cricket, where he has already enjoyed some success, including a stint playing as a specialist batsman at No 7.”The 20-year-old Bess has played 16 first-class matches and was impressive in the Champion County match for the MCC against Essex in March. “Dom Bess has impressed everyone with his performances for Somerset and when he has been given opportunities with England representative teams,” Smith added. “With Jack Leach missing out, the selection panel wanted to invest opportunity in a young spin bowler. Dom’s strong form, character and all-round abilities presented a compelling case.”England have awarded incremental contracts to Surrey’s Tom Curran and Middlesex’s Dawid Malan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc53fd6e8cbe578c3d6d2225f19b13875f8706a/0_13_2998_1799/master/2998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0913841aa14996b99eb5246bb1d33","title":"carolina panthers sale david tepper nfl","story":"The Carolina Panthers are being sold for an NFL-record $2.2bn. Hedge fund manager David Tepper has agreed to buy the Panthers from team founder Jerry Richardson, a source has told the Associated Press.The purchase is subject to a vote at the NFL owners meeting next week in Atlanta. The price tag is the most ever paid for an NFL franchise, eclipsing the $1.4bn the Pegula family paid to purchase the Buffalo Bills in 2014.Forbes listed Tepper’s net worth at $11.4bn in February of 2017. He donated $55m to Carnegie Mellon University’s business school in 2013. If the deal does go through, Tepper will find himself in an interesting position due to President Donald Trump’s ongoing feud with the NFL over the player protests. In April Tepper told a student at his alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University: “whether I like the person or not I’m not going to get into that although I did call him a demented, narcissistic scumbag. And if you look up demented, narcissistic scumbag, you’ll see my name calling Trump that. Just Google those three words.”Richardson was the first and only majority owner of the Panthers. He became only the first former player since George Halas to become an NFL owner when he was awarded an expansion franchise in 1993. Richardson promised fans at the time the Panthers would win a Super Bowl “within 10 years.” Carolina have reached the Super Bowl twice, including in 2015, but have never won the championship. Richardson announced in December he was selling the team amid an NFL investigation into sexual and racial misconduct in the workplace. That decision came after a report by Sports Illustrated detailing Richardson’s alleged misconduct. Tepper’s own workplace environment has been called into question. In a 2010 New York Magazine profile, the publication described his offices: “Tepper has a pair of brass testicles. Cartoonishly huge and grotesquely veiny, they are affixed to a plaque inscribed with the words THE MOST VALUABLE SET OF ALL TIME and are not at all out of place in Appaloosa’s offices, which resemble a high-end sports bar – all polished mahogany and flat-screen TVs and black-and-gold Steelers paraphernalia – or a wealthy frat house.”The league’s investigation into the allegations is still ongoing.

Mohoric finished 34sec ahead of the main bunch, which led by the Irish sprinter Sam Bennett of Bora-Hansgrohe.Chris Froome finished safely in the pack and moves up to 10th in the general classification, still two-and-a-half minutes adrift of Yates in the race for the pink jersey.Stage 11 on Wednesday will be another lumpy one, covering 156km and three categorised climbs between Assisi and Osimo.1 Matej Mohoric (Svn) Bahrain-Merida 6hr 4min 52sec 2 Nico Denz (Ger) AG2R La Mondiale at same time 3 Sam Bennett (Ire) Bora-Hansgrohe at 34sec 4 Enrico Battaglin (It) LottoNL-Jumbo 5 Davide Ballerini (It) Androni-Sidermec 6 Mads Würtz Schmidt (Den) Katusha 7 Francesco Gavazzi (It) Androni-Sidermec 8 Jarlinson Pantano (Col) Trek-Segafredo 9 Gianluca Brambilla (It) Trek-Segafredo 10 José Gonçalves (Por) Katusha all at same time.1 Simon Yates (GB) Mitchelton-Scott 43hr 42min 38sec 2 Tom Dumoulin (Neth) Sunweb at 41 sec 3 Thibaut Pinot (Fr) Groupama-FDJ at 46sec 4 Domenico Pozzovivo (It) Bahrain-Merida at 1min 0sec 5 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar at 1min 23sec 6 George Bennett (NZ) LottoNL-Jumbo at 1min 36sec 7 Rohan Dennis (Aus) BMC Racing at 2min 8sec 8 Pello Bilbao (Sp) Astana at same time 9 Michael Woods (Can) Education First-Drapac at 2min 28sec 10 Chris Froome (GB) Sky at 2min 30sec."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93b46be975821b9e17feebc774140ca2d1efcc9/32_374_5550_3330/master/5550.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c0d0747d540ba647b12c5a545f42c2b","title":"irleand pakistan test match report","story":"Ireland came up short in their bid to pull off a miracle in Malahide as they were beaten by five wickets in an enthralling inaugural Test with Pakistan. Hopes of an unlikely home victory were raised on the final day when the tourists, chasing 160, crashed to 14 for three, but half-centuries from Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam helped Pakistan home ahead of their meeting with England at Lord’s next week.The result had appeared to be a foregone conclusion on Sunday when Pakistan made Ireland follow on with a 180-run lead, but Kevin O’Brien’s century guided the hosts to 339 second time around. That knock ended on 118 to his first ball on Tuesday and despite further fireworks early in Pakistan’s innings, Ireland were unable to record what would have been only the fourth win in Test history for a side following on.As Pakistan warmed up on the final morning, they could hear Daniel Powter’s Bad Day playing, but if it was meant to be psychological warfare it did not work as Mohammad Abbas took the final three Irish wickets within 40 minutes. O’Brien, who had been pivotal to Ireland’s fightback on Monday, fell to his first ball of the day chasing a wider delivery and nicking to slip.Boyd Rankin and Tyrone Kane soon followed, both bowled by Abbas, who returned five for 66 in the innings, and nine for 110 in the match, as Ireland added just 20 to their overnight score. The 160 target was still enough to make the chase intriguing and the drama grew once Tim Murtagh and Rankin made early inroads.Azhar Ali’s tactic of dancing down to Murtagh proved short-lived as a shaped delivery did for him and he edged through to first slip from the innings’ fourth ball. Pakistan then slipped to 13 for two for the second time in the match when Haris Sohail attempted one drive too many and picked out Ed Joyce at gully off Rankin.And when Murtagh struck again, bowling Asad Shafiq through the gate, Ireland sensed a stunning success. Only England in 1894 and 1981, and India in 2001, had won a Test after following on, and no country had won their inaugural fixture in the longest format since Australia won the first Test match in 1877.The 11th Test nation’s optimism began to dissipate with Imam and Azam at the crease, though the former was fortunate an edge dropped short off Murtagh and the latter was almost undone by a Rankin yorker. Imam, in particular, looked at ease and was scampering between the wickets – a trait his uncle Inzamam-ul-Haq was not renowned for during his career – as Pakistan reached lunch 52 for three, needing 108 more.Ireland could not afford any missed opportunities and Andrew Balbirnie, who got a pair with the bat, endured another moment to forget at third slip when he put down Azam from his first ball faced in the second session. With the threat of rain to come later in the day, Pakistan sensed the need to accelerate against attacking Irish fields and Imam soon moved to his maiden 50 before Azam progressed to his fifth.Balbirnie at least had some reason to remember this match fondly when his throw back to Stuart Thompson at the non-striker’s end ran out Azam on 59. Thompson then pinned Sarfraz Ahmed in front but Pakistan got over the line prior to tea, with Imam unbeaten on 74."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de80ae67a91bddbbcde4909ec05cd482e93d663/0_133_5420_3252/master/5420.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c996177679957798607a8e45b76d3bf6","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook plans uk evidence mps parliament","story":"MPs inquiring into Cambridge Analytica breach urge Facebook CEO to appear via video linkFacebook has said Mark Zuckerberg has no plans to come to the UK to give evidence to parliament despite the threat of a formal summons, prompting frustrated MPs inquiring into the Cambridge Analytica data breach to ask if he would appear via video link instead.The social network said it recognised “the seriousness of these issues” and provided written answers to 39 questions posed by the MPs, who had argued that the oral evidence of the chief technology officer sent in lieu of Zuckerberg last month was insufficient.Damian Collins, the Conservative chair of the digital culture media and sport select committee, said: “If Mark Zuckerberg truly recognises the ‘seriousness’ of these issues as they say they do, we would have expected that he would want to appear.“Although Facebook says Mr Zuckerberg has no plans to travel to the UK, we would also be open to taking his evidence by video link, if that would be the only way to do this.”The MPs intend to maintain the threat of issuing a formal summons to Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, while they hope he can be persuaded to appear. They also indicated they would study the company’s response to their questions as they weighed up what to do next.Select committees rarely formally summon witnesses to appear, but the move has been successful in persuading another US-based chief executive to give evidence in the past.Rupert Murdoch and his son James were formally summoned by the same committee in the summer of 2011, after the two men had initially indicated they would not answer questions about phone hacking at the News of the World. Once the committee issued a formal summons, the duo relented, and chose to appear.However, in practice, the committee has no power to force a person to give evidence if they are based abroad, as Zuckerberg is.

Captain Liu Chuanjian – hailed as a hero on social media after having to land the Airbus A319 manually – told the Chengdu Economic Daily his aircraft had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000ft when a deafening sound tore through the cockpit. There was a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature. When he looked over, the right windshield was gone. “There was no warning sign. Suddenly the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window,” he was quoted as saying. “Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.”The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in. He sustained scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said, adding that one other cabin crew member was injured in the descent. None of the plane’s 119 passengers were hurt. An investigation is under way. The flight, Sichuan Airlines 3U8633, left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday morning and was bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. It made its emergency landing in the south-west city of Chengdu. “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake,” an unnamed passenger told the government-run China News Service. “We didn’t know what was going on and we panicked. Then the oxygen masks dropped … We experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilised again. “I’m still nervous. I don’t dare to take an airplane anymore. But I’m also happy I had a narrow escape.” The windshield shattered about half an hour after the plane took off at 6.25am local time, the Chengdu Economic Daily said. A separate report said the aircraft had accumulated 19,912 flight hours since entering service at Sichuan Airlines in July 2011.Birds or lightning strikes have been known to crack airliners’ windshields before but an entire windshield coming off is rare. In 1990 one of the pilots on British Airways flight 5390 was sucked partially out of the cabin window after its windshield blew out at 23,000 feet. He survived the incident, which occurred on a BAC-111 jet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073b742223d6dee8095c90e3570d3ec86e98bc5f/0_330_5056_3034/master/5056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75dbe75d78e9bfb4b76cdd3976554fa8","title":"central european university ready to move out of hungary","story":"Michael Ignatieff of Budapest-based Central European University says institution has been left in limbo after Viktor Orbán questioned its legal statusCentral European University is prepared to move its base of operations out of Hungary if the government of Viktor Orbán does not sign a deal to legalise its status soon, its rector has said.“We can’t go into another academic year like this. We’re in a holding pattern but it’s not going to go on too much longer,” said Michael Ignatieff, CEU’s rector and a former liberal politician in his native Canada, in an interview at the CEU campus in Budapest. Ignatieff said the university had demanded a resolution by the start of the new academic year, and that if the government refused to sign, it would be forced to move much of its operations to Vienna. “You can’t run a university in legal limbo, and you can’t have academic freedom without the rule of law,” he said.The Budapest-based university is often seen as a bastion of liberalism, where thousands of students from across central Europe and the former Soviet Union have a received a world-class education in English over the past two decades.Orbán has championed the concept of “illiberal democracy”, and his Fidesz party was re-elected with a two-thirds parliamentary majority last month on an anti-migrant, anti-Soros platform.Hungary’s new parliament is expected to pass the so-called “Stop Soros” legislation in the coming weeks. The bill is targeted at what the government claims is a campaign by the Hungarian-born American financier George Soros to undermine the country and promote immigration. Civil society groups say it will make the work of NGOs dealing with migration issues impossible.On Tuesday, Soros’s Open Society Foundations formally announced they will move their Budapest office to Berlin, confirming earlier rumours.When the Hungarian government moved against CEU last year, saying it violated Hungarian law, mass protests in Budapest and howls of indignation from foreign capitals prompted a rare climbdown from Orbán. However, a final settlement was not reached.The “Stop Soros” law will not target CEU, but the university was founded by Soros and is frequently referred to by government-controlled media as a politicised, anti-government institution. It will soon become clear whether the campaign against CEU was simply political point-scoring, or part of a vendetta that will be seen through to the end.The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has used scaremongering tactics about migrants and refugees as the cornerstone of his politics in the past few years, but in classic populist style he has also required a shadowy, nefarious overlord to target. In Orbán’s case, that figure has been George Soros, who perfectly fits the bill as both insider and outsider in Hungary.Soros was born György Schwartz to a family of Hungarian Jews in 1930, but his father changed their surname to make it more Hungarian. His family split up and lived under assumed identities to escape the Holocaust, and Soros left Hungary in 1947 to study in London. He later emigrated to the US, making billions as an investor and hedge fund manager. His Open Society foundations have donated billions to promoting civil society and human rights, particularly in the former Communist countries of central and eastern Europe.Soros is a favoured target of rightwing governments worldwide, including in Israel. Hungarian officials have used criticism of Soros by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to deflect allegations of antisemitism around their own anti-Soros campaign.However, at times, the rhetoric appears to borrow heavily from antisemitic tropes. In a March\u0026nbspspeech\u0026nbspin which he accused the political opposition of being “Soros candidates”, Orbán referred to his enemies as “not straightforward but crafty not honest but base not national but international does not believe in working but speculates with money”.“I’ve been in politics. You say a lot of things to win elections,” said Ignatieff. “I genuinely don’t know if this was just to win an election or is there something else. There’s no question this is a government with a very strong point of view. Is this an ideology? Is this a vision? How far are they going to go with that vision?”A deal appeared to be reached back in September, but the Hungarian government has yet to sign. Ignatieff said CEU had done everything to comply with the Hungarian government’s requests, including opening a US campus. A negotiated agreement had been waiting for Hungarian government sign-off since September, he said, adding: “We’ve met our obligations and it’s now time for them to meet theirs.” In the days after the election result, Orbán refused to rule out shutting down the university, saying he had not yet discussed the issue with the new government.The European People’s party, the centre-right grouping in the European parliament of which Fidesz is a member, has been criticised for sheltering Orbán, but EPP officials have claimed that without their pressure, the Hungarian government would have closed CEU last year.Over the past eight years, Orbán’s government has cracked down on free media and brought a number of previously independent institutions under its control. There is growing unease in parts of the EPP about how much further a newly emboldened Orbán might push the boundaries. Closure of CEU and a full-blown assault on the judiciary are seen as potential red lines for Orbán’s European partners.In a speech last week to launch his new term in office, Orbán made no secret of his desire to remain in power for many more years, and continue with his project to reshape Hungary, saying he was not thinking about only this four-year term but looking ahead at the next 12 years. “They raised the pitch so high that it’s hard for them to back down now without losing face,” said one western diplomat based in Budapest. “All the indications are that the ‘Stop Soros’ laws will be passed. They may keep CEU open, but will try to do it quietly, as it looks confusing when they’ve just run a whole election campaign on an anti-Soros platform.”Ignatieff said he sympathised with the NGOs affected by the “Stop Soros” laws, but that CEU’s fight was different. “Our purpose is not to hold the government to account. That’s not what universities do.” “Our mission has always been to teach people to be free: meaning sceptical, dispassionate, knowledgeable, smart and hardworking. The symbolic issue is whether there is space for a free institution in this kind of society ... That’s a decision for the government, and it is a decision that will have huge ramifications for what Hungary is.”Many CEU professors are already scoping out Vienna ahead of a potential move, and Ignatieff said he was willing to move the centre of operations to the Austrian capital if the Hungarian government refused to sign the deal in the coming months. “But I will say that if we get pushed, we will not go quietly, and I think they know that,” he warned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c534cd956009a78df6235ff279ad4a3f7d090042/44_0_3412_2048/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eec420ad6013576383c69f13f484eaf","title":"gaza palestinians israel negotiations","story":"Hopes for reviving any Israeli-Palestinian negotiations now look like a remote fantasyPalestinians in the Gaza Strip are desperate. Not only because they are burying their dead while marking the anniversary of the Nakba (catastrophe) of 1948 that saw their grandparents flee or expelled from homes in what is now Israel, but also because their lives under blockade are intolerable, as is the sense that they have been abandoned to their fate by an indifferent world.Israel was their main enemy before and after the 1967 war. It unilaterally dismantled settlements and withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 but still controls its borders, airspace and waters.Meanwhile Egypt’s crossing point at Rafah is often closed and Cairo uses access to put pressure on Hamas and the 2 million people in the territory it rules. Mahmoud Abbas, the West Bank-based Palestinian president, condemned Monday’s killings from Ramallah, but he is hostile too, withholding the salaries of Gazan Palestinian Authority employees because of a row over taxes and legitimacy dating back to Hamas’s takeover in 2007. Efforts at reconciliation between Abbas’s Fatah movement and Hamas have got nowhere since a flurry of excitement last year. Abbas’s demand for disarmament was unacceptable to Hamas. In the 2014 war, when 2,300 Gazans including hundreds of civilians and Hamas fighters were killed, Abbas was accused of nodding and winking at Israel to continue attacking and thus weaken his rivals.Abbas’s popularity has hit rock bottom in the last few months, and not only because of his authoritarian style. The overwhelming reason is that the Palestinian national liberation movement he has led since Yasser Arafat’s death in 2004, with a strategy of non-violence, negotiations and, crucially, security coordination with Israel, has failed to liberate anything.Continuing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem under Benjamin Netanyahu has hammered nail after nail into the coffin of a diplomatic solution. Donald Trump, the US president, has also done much to help write its obituary. Netanyahu, leading the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, is prepared at most to give the Palestinians what he calls a “state-minus” while demanding that Israel be formally recognised as the nation state of the Jewish people. No peace talks have been held for over four years.Increasingly, Palestinians also fret about the wider Arab world. Their cause has long attracted popular support: witness the emotional scenes in cafes from Algiers to Kuwait when al-Jazeera is broadcasting from Gaza, Nablus or Jerusalem. Arab governments are a different matter. Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) have held in part because both are close US allies. Nowadays the discreet links between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, making common cause to confront Iran, have generated accusations that their leaders are “Arab Zionists” who are conspiring to liquidate the Palestinian issue. The bitter isions caused by the war in Syria have been a far bigger preoccupation since 2011.Still, Gaza’s border protests reflect not only despair but also popular mobilisation and tactical creativity that has attracted international attention and condemnation of Israel for using excessive force – albeit at a terrible cost. Hamas certainly wants to harness the protests, but Israel’s insistence that it is merely “defending its borders” from terrorists is a glib soundbite that ignores ordinary Palestinians, a bitterly contested past – and its own role.The US parrots the Israeli line. If Trump’s message in the timing of the controversial opening of the US’s Jerusalem embassy was greeted with jubilation by Israelis, it seemed to Palestinians to be an act of open bias that was deliberately intended to pour salt on their still raw wounds. The message that Jerusalem is “off the table” promoted even Abbas to disqualify the US from playing any role in a future peace process. That means that Trump’s promised “deal of the century” between Israel and the Palestinians – if it is ever delivered – will be pronounced dead on arrival.Hopes for reviving any kind of negotiations now look like a remote fantasy. The same is true of demands for the mass return of Palestinian refugees. Alarm, anger and calls for restraint and investigation are predictable responses to what the Haaretz journalist Amos Harel called “a predictable bloodbath”.But there is an urgent need to persuade the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to end their debilitating rift, to help provide drinkable water, electricity and sewage treatment to Gaza, for Israel to allow more exports and exit permits, and for Egypt to open the Rafah crossing regularly. Otherwise Gaza’s unrelenting misery, when the smoke has cleared, is unlikely to be relieved any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a333b16936f96b91a2f6e310e0705fa4c3b3ad3a/0_39_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3020faa9b778a60688225749605eda89","title":"julian assange ecuador london embassy how he became unwelcome guest","story":"He has been in the Knightsbridge building for six years, but his departure looks ever more likelyby  Luke Harding,  Stephanie Kirchgaessner and  Dan CollynsIn June 2012, a tall, mysterious figure turned up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He rang the bell, walked in and asked for political asylum.It was Julian Assange. Days earlier, he had lost his long legal fight against extradition to Sweden, where two women accused him of rape.Soon afterwards, the left-leaning then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, agreed to Assange’s request, precipitating a major diplomatic row with the British government. And a full-blown siege. politan police officers swarmed outside the building, ready to arrest Assange should he venture out.It was against this febrile backdrop that Correa authorised a secret programme named “Operation Guest”. It was later renamed “Operation Hotel”. The guest was Assange, politely referred to as el huésped.The goal, at first, was to stop detectives bursting into the modest ground-floor embassy and dragging Assange away. But documents seen by the  show it developed into something more complex. The aim seems to have changed from protecting Assange – which propped up WikiLeaks in the process – to spying on him.Whatever its aims, WikiLeaks was able to keep going up to and beyond its role in the 2016 US presidential election, with all the seismic consequences. It was WikiLeaks that published hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and senior Democratic officials, leading to claims that it was part of an alleged Kremlin plot to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.How WikiLeaks got the emails in the first place is an enduring mystery.Did someone drop them off to Assange on a flash drive? Were the files uploaded on to an encrypted remote server? Or did they come in by some other route?Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election, is looking for the answer. The secret records seen by the  and the magazine Focus Ecuador may give him important new clues.According to the documents, the counter-espionage effort began nearly six years ago when a team secretly installed CCTV cameras in the Ecuadorian embassy. They covered the entrance lobby, a meeting room and the mini-balcony from which Assange would periodically address supporters. The agents filmed everyone who came in and out, and kept watch on the street.Security personnel worked two-person shifts and were on duty 24 hours a day. They do not appear to have recorded Assange’s conversations, documents suggest. However, they were able to observe him closeup, noting his moods, habits and sleeping patterns.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.None of this came cheap.The documents set out how Ecuador’s intelligence agency, known as Senain, hired an international security company. Its bill in 2012 was $55,000 (£40,000) a month, paid from a “special expenses” government budget.They detail how the company’s agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy, in a multi-tenant Edwardian mansion block in Basil Street. Unbeknown to Ecuadorian taxpayers, the operatives were camping out in one of the most expensive parts of London, albeit in a basic basement flat with two bedrooms, which cost £2,800 a month.From a control room, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. They consulted with him about anyone wanting to visit. If he agreed, guests were allowed in. They were met in the foyer, went through a security check, and handed over their passports and mobile phones.The documents show that operatives wrote down passport numbers, nationalities and the purposes of the visits. These included “social reunion”, “medical”, “legal” or “VIP”. They clocked when the guest arrived and when they exited, in the early months past a phalanx of armed police waiting in uniform on the embassy’s front steps. At the beginning of the crisis, when the small Andean nation was facing off against the might of the British state, officers lurked on the interior stairs and next to the embassy toilet. Every month, the security company sent a confidential list of Assange’s visitors to the Ecuadorian president. There were additional “extraordinary” reports. Sometimes, the company included stills from secret video footage of interesting guests, plus profiles and analysis. They also reported when a packet of sweets was lobbed on to the balcony, seemingly a present for Assange. It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood.Assange has refused to say how the emails got to WikiLeaks. He denies they came from a “state actor”. The FBI does not appear to believe him. Giving evidence last year, the agency’s then director, James Comey, told Congress that Moscow was behind the DNC cyber-raid. An “intermediary”, he said, passed the emails to WikiLeaks.Assange’s relationship with Moscow is certainly longstanding. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Kremlin-owned television network RT. The Julian Assange Show featured 10 guests, including Correa. Weeks after Assange’s interview with Correa was broadcast, the Australian sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy.The logs record that Assange had more than 80 visitors in one month in 2016. They included the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison and longtime supporters such as Craig Murray, the UK’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Another was the Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat.There were also visits from Assange’s lawyer Gareth Peirce and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, who hosted WikiLeaks at his Norfolk mansion for 13 months up until Assange jumped bail. On 23 June 2016, RT broadcast a referendum special from inside the embassy, with the final guests leaving at 4.30am.The external surveillance team wrote up descriptions of these encounters. They were sent back to Senain and Correa, sources say. The then Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, visited Assange in London, talking with him into the early hours, and criticised Britain for failing to find a solution to the standoff. The UK was unmoved. Asked what the government planned to do about Assange, the then foreign minister, Hugo Swire, said: “Not my stone, not my shoe.”Correa had no immediate comment on the operation. He has previously decried the UK’s attempts to arrest Assange, saying his country would not tolerate “colonialism of any kind”. Meanwhile, leaked invoices show the Ecuadorian government spent as much as $28m on surveillance equipment, sold only to states. What it was used for and by whom is unclear.By 2014, it appears tensions over Assange were growing. The documents reveal that Ecuador’s then ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconí Puig, forwarded a complaint to Senain after a bill arrived for unpaid council tax from Kensington and Chelsea. The tax was payable on the agents’ clandestine flat in Basil Mansions. Puig had no idea it existed. He rang Patiño, demanding to know what was going on, according to sources in Quito. That autumn, the security consultants reported that Assange had somehow set up his own secret communications network. Moreover, they said he had “violated” the embassy’s computers and was apparently reading confidential diplomatic traffic, the company reported. Embassy staff apparently kept their personal files on Assange in a safe – the one place he could not access.The head of Ecuadorian intelligence, Rommy Vallejo, held a meeting with Patiño to discuss the Assange situation and the “risks” he posed to embassy staff. Over time, Assange came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space. Initially, he slept in narrow room next to the balcony. He subsequently colonised a back room as a bedroom and occupied half the kitchen. Assange’s unkempt realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and was entirely private. There was no CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, the rooms only accessible via special codes.Patiño brushed off these concerns. His solution to this internal takeover was to dispatch three undercover intelligence officers from Quito to increase security, documents show. The Assange bill was already causing friction with Ecuador’s financial chief. The new state agents cost an extra $35,000 a month, paid out on top of the security company’s monthly invoice, which had climbed to $97,000.Documents show the private security team’s duties included keeping an eye on Hans Crescent, the street outside the embassy. It reported demonstrations in support of Assange, noting that they became smaller each year. There was a strange visit by an American superfan who spent two days outside the embassy sleeping in a car. Protesters who took part in an anti-Correa demonstration were surreptitiously photographed. One one occasion, the team sent back images of a young man in a suit whom they deemed suspicious. Much of their job involved monitoring British police officers stationed outside. Scotland Yard later scaled back its presence outside the embassy and withdrew officers altogether in 2017, when Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences, which Assange has always denied.In November 2017, the team filed an “extraordinary” 10-page report on a visit by two Catalan separatists, Oriol Soler and Andreu Grinyó. The meeting might “trigger criticism” from Madrid if it leaked, they concluded. Assange tweeted that same day in support of Catalan secession.Over time, Ecuador’s counter-espionage operation became mundane. In January, the agents noted that a new cleaner had started work. Typically, Assange would hold private conversations in the women’s bathroom, they wrote in a daily log. Visitors noticed that he used a “squelch box”, a counter-surveillance device that emitted a loud sound.Letters arrived for him, as did flowers, the agents noted. The flowers were thrown away “according to protocol”. Sometimes, Assange smoked a pipe. His mood was generally placid. On occasion, there were angry eruptions, sympathetically interpreted by the agents who could understand his frustration after being in the embassy for such a long time. The agents faithfully recorded visits from Bolivia’s former foreign minister, as well as such high-profile guests as Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. Early this year, Assange’s most frequent visitor was the legal analyst Stella Morris, a member of his legal team.Journalists and film-makers have been frequent guests. They included the ’s Ewen MacAskill, who visited twice in January and February to discuss Assange’s confinement and his prospects for the future.In February, there were no more visits recorded for two weeks. This barren spell was marked across a line as “sin visitas”.Friends conceded that after almost six years in the embassy, Assange was visibly suffering, and in poor health, although they described him as mentally robust. At weekends, embassy staff go home, leaving him with no one to talk to apart from a solitary guard.The logs do not explain how WikiLeaks received the 70,000 Democratic emails that had been hacked.By the spring of this year, developments in Quito had moved in an ominous direction for Assange. Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, pronounced him a costly “inherited problem” and made it clear that he viewed Assange as an obstacle to better relations with the US.As a candidate, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks when it revealed embarrassing Democratic party secrets. When Assange released the email correspondence of the Clinton aide John Podesta, Trump exclaimed: “I love WikiLeaks.” Before and after the election, Donald Trump Jr exchanged a handful of direct Twitter messages with Assange.Seemingly, the Trump White House changed its view when Wikileaks dumped out classified CIA hacking tools. The agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo, who was later made secretary of state, dubbed WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service”.In March, Assange’s internet access was cut off. A jammer was installed to prevent him from accessing emails. For more than a month, he has been forbidden visitors. Friends say he is passing the time by reading. They say he is leafing through books on the US election, which WikiLeaks did so much to influence and – its critics allege – subvert. Meanwhile, Correa, Assange’s protector and patron, has moved to Belgium. He has since landed at job at RT.Last week, the embassy appeared deserted. Nearby, well-heeled passengers emerged from Bentleys and Mercedes outside Harrods. Six supporters held banners that said “Free Assange” and #ReconnectJulian. A violinist serenaded him from the pavement. There was no sign of the guest, but the window next to his balcony was open.Assange faces a tough choice. If he walks out of the embassy, he can expect arrest and could spend up to a year in prison for breaking his bail conditions.The US might then seek to extradite him. He would contest any attempt, and might win, but would face a long, uncomfortable spell behind bars while his case is decided.Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next. Russia would be an obvious choice, though this would cause problems with the US. Cuba and Venezuela are also said to be under discussion. Since January, Assange has officially been an Ecuadorian diplomat. However, this probably would not stop the UK arresting him if it had the chance.If Assange remains in the embassy, cut off from the world, WikiLeaks cannot function. Either way, it is clear that Ecuador no longer wants him. His future is more uncertain than ever. The most likely scenario is that he will soon walk out the door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f968492bfa40b66da8728f7d5c4cfcc7aedaa163/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a52ddc1f35ccae369b4cf4528a86b5","title":"mp who called jacinda ardern a stupid little girl refuses to own up","story":"Member of New Zealand’s opposition made comment about prime minister in parliamentA male MP from New Zealand’s opposition party who called the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, a “stupid little girl” remains unidentified more than a week after making the remark in parliament.A search of parliamentary records and an investigation by Newshub have so far not uncovered the identity of the man who blasted Ardern – the third woman to lead the country. The speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, halted proceedings immediately after the comment was made, and demanded the man apologise for the “very sexist remark” directed towards the prime minister, who is 37 years old and expecting her first child next month.The MP who spoke the words has yet to own up to the incident. In doing so, he would have to issue an official apology to Ardern and withdraw the remark. According to comments made by Mallard at the time, the MP was sat somewhere behind the opposition leader, Simon Bridges.

He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002, but has said he may request more.Last week Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the leader of an Islamist militia that had been opposed to Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, that she was “profoundly sorry” about the role MI6 played in their kidnap, rendition and torture in 2004. The government paid Boudchar £500,000. Throughout his six-year legal battle, Behaj insisted he wanted only an apology, and he received no payment. In return, the couple dropped their civil claim against MI6 and the Foreign Office, and against Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, who were foreign secretary and head of counter-terrorism at MI6 at the time of the couple’s kidnap. The couple’s lawyers also withdrew their attempt to seek a judicial review of the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision not to charge Allen with criminal offences after a four-year Scotland Yard investigation.The couple had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and detained by the CIA after a tipoff from MI6. They were put on a flight to Tripoli, where Belhaj was imprisoned for six years and frequently tortured. Boudchar was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight. She was four and a half months pregnant at the time.Four weeks later, a second leading opponent of Gaddafi was kidnapped in Hong Kong after an MI6 tipoff and flown to Tripoli with his wife and four children. He settled his claim against the British government in 2012, receiving £2.2m. Documents discovered in government offices in Tripoli during the Libyan revolution show the kidnap operations followed lengthy MI6 surveillance of the two men.Papers recovered at the same time show that information subsequently extracted under torture from the two men was used to justify the detention and attempted deportation of a number of Libyans living in Britain.There were also papers that detailed the way in which Gaddafi’s intelligence officers were invited to Britain, where they allegedly threatened Libyan asylum seekers and British-Libyan nationals, in the presence of MI5 officers. Asked whether it was resisting Ashton’s request because it did not wish to see further evidence of unlawful and politically embarrassing activities coming to light, the Cabinet Office declined to comment.Ashton submitted his request for information in 2014 and hopes ultimately to achieve a greater understanding of the role the British government played in creating Libya as it is today.This would include examining British responses to the Lockerbie bombing and Gaddafi’s support for the IRA the period of rapprochement during which the rendition plots were hatched and the UK’s role in supporting the insurgency that eventually toppled the Gaddafi regime.“The public interest in understanding Britain’s policy towards Libya is overwhelming,” Ashton said. “It seems extraordinary that the Cabinet Office has resisted my freedom of information request at every turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c458b35223a9139d55120f869df128c21efc14d/300_627_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07b67d5d3ac846ae409e276f152568bf","title":"70th anniversary palestine nakba day in pictures","story":"Palestinians have been marking Nakba Day, which is generally commemorated on 15 May to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.

Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor.

Photograph: AP British prime minister Theresa May has invited all Conservative backbench MPs to private Brexit briefings in Downing Street on Tuesday, as she tried to stop a row over Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU tearing the party apart. Ms May admitted there were flaws in both the customs models being considered by the government, a view reinforced by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, at a foreign affairs meeting in Brussels. “So he thinks it’s unnecessary to fight about it, as none of them are realistic, no matter which one they choose.”Ms May is being urged by senior Tories to abandon her support for a so-called “customs partnership” with the EU, with hopes rising in Eurosceptic circles that the prime minister will switch her support to their favoured option.Ms May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell gave Tory MPs what one called “a technical briefing” on the advantages and flaws of the two customs options being considered by ministers and which have split the cabinet.The prime minister has abandoned hopes of resolving the issue this week, but is hoping to finally agree a favoured customs proposal next week. “This is complex stuff,” said one aide. “This was a chance to explain the issues and take questions.”Ms May’s preferred option - a “new customs partnership” under which Britain would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - was rejected by a majority of her inner Brexit cabinet earlier this month. Boris Johnson called it “crazy”.Pro-Brexit ministers, including Mr Johnson, back a “maximum facilitation” plan that would create a customs border between Britain and the EU, including in Ireland, but use technology and “trusted trader” schemes to smooth trade. The political mood appears to be shifting towards the latter option, even though the EU has warned that it would not address its demand that there should be no hard border in Ireland.Damian Green, Ms May’s former deputy and a close ally for many years, suggested on Sunday that a form of “max fac” could emerge as the preferred option, but that Britain might have to stay in a customs union while the technology was developed.British chancellor Philip Hammond is also said by colleagues to be willing to consider that approach, although he remains worried about the impact of any customs border on British companies trading with the EU. Greg Clark, the pro-European business secretary, paid a visit to Svinesund on the Norway-Sweden border on Monday morning to examine how customs arrangements work there.“Greg wanted to see it to get a proper understanding of how an example of ‘max fac’ could work in practice, and it was definitely not without friction,” said one ally.Meanwhile David Miliband, former Labour foreign secretary, returned to the British political fray on Monday to join a cross-party campaign for a soft Brexit.“Britain is being held to ransom by demands for a hard Brexit, severing links with the customs union and single market,” Mr Miliband said.Mr Miliband shared a platform with Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Commons Treasury committee, calling for Britain to retain very close ties to the EU. - Financial Times Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markles wedding cake royal bakes ages","story":"Meghan and Harry have chosen their wedding cake, and it is to be a celebration of spring a zingy, floral confection with firm nods to all of the current fashionable food preoccupations - seasonality, provenance and natural ingredients.

It could even help bust fake news and social media stories.You can test yourself and family with a few sample questions using the tool at the bottom of this page.False health claims come in many forms and are the cause of many millions of unnecessary deaths worldwide, said Sir Iain Chalmers, a co-author of the study and world authority on evidence-based decision making.“What this research shows is that by teaching children a series of simple concepts we can significantly enhance their ability to detect and reject pseudo science and false health claims.”Vaccine scares, old wives tales and claims of miracle cures are common across the globe.In Europe these bogus claims have led to a recent surge in measles cases, an endless stream of fad diets and, for many, a dangerous reliance on quack or “alternative” therapies such as homeopathy and colonic irrigation.Goodbye, Goop: 7 of Gwyneth Paltrow\u0027s most ridiculous recommendationsIn parts of Africa people believe that cow dung should be used to treat burns, and in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan vaccine myths are preventing  health workers eradicate the last remaining pockets of polio.Not to be outdone, Gwyneth Paltrow\u0027s Californian lifestyle site Goop now sells a medicine bag containing an assortment of magically charged stones – yours for just $85.Fuelling these and other health claims say Sir Iain and his colleague, Dr Andy Oxman, director of the Centre for Informed Health Choices in Oslo, is not a lack of information specific to each claim but a failure to teach children a handful of key concepts necessary to make a sensible judgment in the first place. New or expensive treatments are not necessarily better  Personal experiences or anecdotes are not a reliable way to judge whether something works  Treatments can be both harmful and beneficial at the same time  Just because a treatment is popular, it doesn’t mean it’s the best Dr Oxman has spent his career trying to encourage people to think critically about health but decided to switch his focus to children in an attempt to catch them before they start learning bad habits.He tested his theories in primary schools in Uganda, not because Ugandans are more likely to believe bogus health claims but “because the fewer resources you have the more important it is not to waste them,” he says.Researchers worked with staff and pupils in Ugandan primary schools to teach children the fundamentals of critical thinking around health claimsWorking with teachers and children in Ugandan primary schools he and a team of researchers came up with a list of key concepts, an algorithm for scoring them and various teaching materials, including a comic book-style textbook which would teach children the fundamentals of critical thinking around health claims.The full package is available to parents and teachers online.The book uses local beliefs as a basis for debunking myths.Allen Nsangi, a researcher at Makerere University College of Health Sciences in Uganda, worked with the children on the design and content of the book and trained teachers to deliver the lessons..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}I would love to see the whole world thinking critically – we really need this in the age of fake newsDr Andy Oxman, director of the Centre for Informed Health Choices“You could tell they loved the lessons. They would be drawing on their own personal experiences of hearing health claims – like the cow dung – and were very active throughout,” she said.At the end of the nine-week session of lessons the researchers tested the children on their ability to assess health claims and compared them with a group of children who had not had the lessons.Research published by the team in the Lancet last year showed that 69 per cent of those children who had had the lessons scored highly in the test, compared to just 27 per cent of those who had not had them.A year later, the children are using their new knowledge, researchers have found.Dr Oxman says: “One of the concepts is that new and more expensive isn’t necessarily better and that’s one the kids carried away. One kid talked about not buying a new pair of shoes just because they were expensive.The alternative therapy of cupping has risen in popularity in recent years thanks to endorsements from celebrities such as Gwyneth PaltrowAnother talked about buying toothpaste. Mum wanted to buy a more expensive brand but when the kid looked at the label they realised the ingredients were the same.”While this might seem like a lightweight project, Dr Oxman says that learning to think critically is a vital tool – important not just for health but in many areas of life – especially as so many of us are wedded to social media, scanning our timelines for the latest news..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Critical thinking is much broader than just health – everyday decisions can become more informedSandra Galvin, University of Galway researcherCritical thinking is on a list of 21st century competencies people recognise as vital. Most people recognise the importance of knowledge about health but these two things have not been put together and there aren\u0027t many resources out there.I would love to see the whole world thinking critically – we really need this in the age of fake news. The same sort of skills apply to lots of political and personal decisions, he says.The new tool has been used in Norway and Rwanda and will soon be launched in Spain. Researchers in Ireland are also looking at introducing it in primary schools there.Sandra Galvin, a researcher at the University of Galway, is currently adapting the tool to work in Ireland with a view to launching it in two primary schools in 2019, before conducting a full-scale trial along the lines of the Lancet study.While it is unlikely that the Irish material will include advice on cow dung it may feature the old wives\u0027 tale that to get rid of a wart you should rub a potato on it.Old wives tales: spurious claims can impact on people\u0026#39s health all over the world“If we can get this into schools the real benefit will be long term,” says Galvin. “It would be great if in a few years’ time a student picks up a newspaper and reads about an energy drink making them run faster and they step back and say ‘hang on a second’. How was that study conducted, what are the biases, if the evidence doesn’t come from a randomised-control trial where does it come from?“Critical thinking is much broader than just health – everyday decisions can become more informed. We will have a population that has a critical eye,” she says.Currently, there are no plans to introduce the lessons into the UK but Helen Wilson, a lecturer in science education at Oxford Brookes University, believes there is space for it in the current curriculum.She led a study called Thinking, Doing, Talking Science which aimed to encourage primary school children to think more deeply about science. Pupils were asked ‘Big Questions’, such as ‘How do you know that the earth is a sphere?’ that were used to stimulate scientific discussion.Wilson\u0027s study found that the approach improved pupils\u0027 progress and had a particular impact on poorer children.She says: If you teach children to think critically about the content of the curriculum they do better.

Bleached of patriarchal presumptions about the bride (“it starts with her sinking into my arms, and ends with her arms in my sink”), it has also lost its gender-bias when it comes to the spouses: he-he and she-she combinations are run of the mill these days. Not even hen parties are what they were, according to James Eadie QC, who has pointed out that such events are often no longer gender segregated.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, with Ms Markle\u0027s father Thomas – who was to walk his daughter down the aisle – claiming on Monday that he was no longer planning to attend the ceremony.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, he has reportedly changed his plans.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.So what\u0027s in store? Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.Thomas Markle Snr is apparently not coming to the wedding after reports this weekend that he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the ceremony and has suffered a heart attack.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.The celebrity website TMZ first reported that Meghan\u0027s father had pulled out of the wedding. The site stated that it had spoken to the US actress\u0027 father, saying: He\u0027s now decided not to go because he doesn\u0027t want to embarrass the Royal Family or his daughter.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsPrince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSoldier killed on training exercise due to officer\u0026#39s \u0026#39total disregard for safety,\u0026#39 court hearsNicola Sturgeon accused of engineering constitutional crisis as MSPs refuse consent for Brexit BillWarring tour guides turn picturesque Bruges into a battlegroundComment: Why Boris Johnson is the William Brown of BrexitMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleMother-of-four killed by digger as she helped renovate garden for in-lawsSoldier killed on training exercise due to officer\u0026#39s \u0026#39total disregard for safety,\u0026#39 court hearsNicola Sturgeon accused of engineering constitutional crisis as MSPs refuse consent for Brexit BillWarring tour guides turn picturesque Bruges into a battlegroundComment: Why Boris Johnson is the William Brown of BrexitMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesThomas Markle Snr now wants to come to Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s wedding - if his health allowsComment: There\u0026#39s a modern case for marriage – so why isn\u0026#39t the government making it?Ramadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranNearly a quarter of children are starting school with rotten teeth, figures showWhat Iraq\u0026#39s election results say about Iran\u0026#39s waning influenceNorth Korea \u0026#39will join efforts for a total ban on nuclear tests\u0026#39, ambassador tells UNFad diets, alternative therapies and vaccine scares: How to \u0026#39inoculate\u0026#39 your child against health myths Comment: Why we must work together to prevent Disease X We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/15/TELEMMGLPICT000163577130_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"two previously unseen pages anne franks diary published","story":"The two new pages of Anne Frank\u0026#39s diary, seen at a press conference at the Anne Frank House in AmsterdamResearchers using digital editing techniques deciphered the writing on two pages of Anne Frank\u0027s diary that she had covered over with brown masking paper, discovering four risque jokes and a candid explanation of sex, contraception and prostitution.Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile, said Frank van Vree, director of the Netherlands Institute for War Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The \u0027dirty\u0027 jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.Anne, age 13 at the time, wrote the two pages on Sept. 28, 1942, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex behind a canal-side house in Amsterdam.Later on, possibly fearing prying eyes or no longer liking what she had written, she covered them over with brown paper, and their content remained a tantalizing mystery for decades.It turns out the pages contained four jokes about sex that Anne herself described as dirty and an explanation of women\u0027s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.A picture of Anne Frank behind Anne Frank Foundation director, Ronald Leopold, who said the adolescent was understandably curious about sex education, which is covered in the pagesThey bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank, Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House museum, said Tuesday.Experts on Anne\u0027s diary said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne\u0027s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.However, he said it provides an early example of how Anne creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about. In her diary, for example, she addressed entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.Anne wrote her diary while she and her family hid for more than two years during World War II. The family went into hiding in July 1942 and remained there, provided with food and other essentials by a close-knit group of helpers, until Aug. 4, 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne\u0027s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp. Anne was 15.After the war, Otto Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions. Please review our commenting policySoldier killed on training exercise due to officer\u0026#39s \u0026#39total disregard for safety,\u0026#39 court hearsNicola Sturgeon accused of engineering constitutional crisis as MSPs refuse consent for Brexit BillWarring tour guides turn picturesque Bruges into a battlegroundComment: Why Boris Johnson is the William Brown of BrexitMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married this weekend (Saturday, 19 May). Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC\u0027s coverage will run from 9am until 2pm on Saturday. The broadcast will be anchored by Huw Edwards, Kirsty Young and Dermot O\u0027Leary from the grounds of Windsor Castle. Young and O\u0027Leary will cover the build-up from the castle\u0027s moat, whilst newsreader Edwards presents from the equally spectacular roof of the Windsor Guard Room.They will be supported by a team of roaming presenters including The One Show\u0027s Alex Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Ore Oduba, who will capture the excitement on the ground. The BBC has announced that a television licence will not be needed to watch the wedding, allowing communities to screen the event at street parties and gatherings.  ITV\u0027s output will run from 9:25am until 3pm, presented by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, using a purpose-built studio in Windsor.Other presenters include Mary Nightingale, Nina Hossain, Charlotte Hawkins and royal editor Chris Ship who will provide updates throughout the day.Sky\u0027s coverage will also start early, running from 9am until 3pm. Kay Burley, Anna Botting, Jayne Secker, Sarah-Jane Mee, Colin Brazier and Jonathan Samuels will present the live coverage from Windsor. Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, travel to Buckingham Palace, after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, 2011As Harry and Meghan will enter the chapel at 12:00 B.S.T, North American viewers will have an early start if they want to catch the action live.   The first footage will be available from CBS\u0027 This Morning, which airs at 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT). NBC takes its entire Today show to Windsor for their coverage beginning at 4:30 E.S.T (1:30 PT), and ABC News and Good Morning America will begin at 5:00 E.S.T (2.00 PT).Meanwhile, BBC America will broadcast a live simulcast of the UK\u0027s BBC One from 4:15 E.S.T (1:15 PT), and HBO begins their live coverage at the more accommodating time of 7:15 E.S.T (4:30 PT). All of these American broadcasters are set to provide online and mobile coverage of the big day,  but ensure you are a paid subscriber to watch BBC America or HBO.Another alternative is to find one of almost 200 cinema screenings across the US for a 10am (local time) screening of ITV\u0027s broadcast, only a few hours after the events unfold in Windsor. Canadian\u0027s can turn to national broadcaster CBC from 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT) for live coverage, or opt to follow their live CBC News blog with updates from the goings-on at Windsor. Whist CBC\u0027s World Report radio programme will air from 6:00 E.S.T (3:00 PT) for a special royal wedding breakfast edition.On the opposite side of the globe, New Zealanders can tune-in from 22:30 for TVNZ\u0027s simulcast of BBC One for the ceremony set to begin at 23:00 Wellington-time.

Never mind... there\u0027s various screenings taking place across the country, including in Belfast, Salisbury, Leeds, Swansea, Winchester and Portsmouth.Here are the main events taking place in the capital.Head down to ONE Marylebone church for its Royal Wedding Party. The all day event will feature live screenings from Windsor at 12 noon as well as various entertainment throughout the day, including live bands, corsage making and first dance classes. Make sure you get a ticket though - they\u0027re £25. Over in Chelsea, Bluebird on the King\u0027s Road is hosting a full day screening of the wedding, followed by a live DJ from 5pm. Everything from bunch, burgers and strawberries and cream will be available. Tickets are £25 and include a glass of bubbles. Cheers!In Greenwich, a big screen will be set up on the lawn in front of the National Maritime Museum between 10am and 3pm. There will also be a big screen up in the shadow of the iconic Battersea Power Station. Both screenings are free - even better. Kensington Palace is also hosting a special outdoor screening of the wedding in the palace gardens in association with The Luna Cinema - what better place to follow all the action than in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s back garden.However, the 1,000 tickets were only available via a ballot, which has now closed. If you\u0027re one of the lucky ones you\u0027ll be watching the historic event unfold on the Orangery lawn with a picnic and a glass of bubbles.You can expect the wedding to attract a large audience in the UK and abroad. About 27 million Brits and 23 million Americans watched the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.The BBC\u0027s coverage of William and Kate\u0027s wedding attracted 67.2 per cent of the television audience share that day, attracting 18.7 million viewers to BBC One during the ceremony. More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby. They were also criticised for using Fearne Cotton to provide coverage from outside Buckingham Palace.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAs excitement builds before the wedding day, a host of broadcasters will deploy in-depth documentaries and extended Harry and Meghan coverage.ITV have already aired a one-off feature entitled Invitation to a Royal Wedding. It looks-back at British royal weddings from the past and is produced by the team responsible for the Princess Diana documentary Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy.The BBC unleashes its programming on the Friday night, with Edwards, Young and O\u0027Leary featuring in The Royal Wedding: They\u0027re Getting Married In The Morning. A large handful of major American broadcasters have announced plans for royal wedding inspired programmes to be shown in the coming weeks.The FA Cup final falls on the same day as the royal wedding.

Despite some anecdotal evidence that shortages of European workers may have pushed up wages, there’s precious little evidence of that in the aggregate data. Real wages grew less than half a percent in the year to March in the year before the referendum, when close to 300,000 Europeans joined the workforce, they grew by 1.5 per cent.What the blue passport row tells us about our economy after BrexitImmigration, and in particular free movement, was one of the key factors – many would argue the key factor – behind the Brexit vote. Yet since, late last year, the government conceded that free movement would continue precisely as now until the end of the so-called “transition” period in December 2020, we’ve heard very little about it in the context of the Brexit debate.Over the last few months, far more column inches have been devoted to the subject of the Irish border and the Customs Union – hardly mentioned during the campaign, and certainly not big vote-winners on either side – than to the subject of the UK’s post-Brexit immigration policy.Perhaps in parallel, public concern about immigration has fallen sharply – the proportion naming it as one of the most important issues facing Britain has fallen from well over half at the time of the referendum to less than a fifth now.Is this because the public think that Brexit means that we’ve “taken back control?” That seems unlikely to happen before 2021 at the earliest. Because the numbers have fallen? They remain historically high overall. Because there is greater public awareness that falling immigration has its (very considerable) downsides, including increased pressure on an already vastly overstretched NHS? Or simply because the papers have stopped writing quite so many scare stories? At this point, no-one can be sure.But in any case immigration has pushed itself back on to the agenda. The Windrush scandal has nothing to do with Brexit: it is the predictable (and predicted) consequence of the “hostile environment” measures introduced by Theresa May as Home Secretary during the 2010-15 government. Policies were designed to “root out illegals” (in the words of one of the policy’s leading supporters, David Goodhart) by making life difficult or impossible for people who cannot (as the Prime Minister put it of one Windrush-era arrival) “evidence their settled status.”These have inevitably hit some people who arrived here legitimately a long time ago, as well as the thousands of children who were born or grew up here but cannot afford the Home Office’s exorbitant fees. But at some point in the future, the “hostile environment” policy will be the primary means by which we enforce immigration policy against EU nationals as well as those from beyond. Remember that, despite the Prime Minister’s deliberately misleading rhetoric, ending free movement has little or nothing to do with border control. Controls – over access to employment, health care and housing –  will happen well inside our borders.And Windrush is just the tip of the iceberg. In the last few weeks, the Prime Minister has intervened personally to stop NHS hospitals hiring desperately needed doctors from outside the EU, ignoring pleas from virtually every Department involved.Most people have a more balanced view of immigration than you thinkDespite clear evidence of maladministration (to put it charitably) the Immigration Minister has refused to correct the Home Office’s error in deporting students falsely accused of cheating, or to intervene in the cases of highly skilled migrants threatened with deportation on obviously spurious grounds. And taxpayers face a large bill for compensation to EU migrants deported in clear violation of the law.What do all these issues have in common? The answer is that they are a combination of the Prime Minister’s fixation on the net migration target, which leads to policies that focus on reducing numbers (either by stopping people coming here or by finding ways to kick out those already here) and a toxic Home Office culture, where there has been, and still is, absolutely no incentive at any level to take account either of the impact of decisions on iniduals or on the broader interest of the UK.The result is policies that manage to combine arbitrary cruelty with economic illiteracy. And while the Prime Minister must bear the main responsibility, senior civil servants have a lot to answer for as well.So Sajid Javid needs to get a grip both on the policy and the administration of his Department – and this can’t wait for Brexit. The assumption in both Whitehall and Westminster was that – having been originally been promised fully a year ago – the government was set on “kicking the can” on the post-Brexit immigration system until at least the end of the year.This was partly for good reasons. The Home Office has enough on its plate already, and the independent Migration Advisory Committee will produce a comprehensive review of the evidence on the impact of EU migration in September, incorporating new research. And partly because Brexit-related paralysis has also infected this area of policy  – the Cabinet is unable to agree whether there should be any preference for EU nationals in the new system.But rumours (unconfirmed as yet) suggest that the long-delayed Immigration White Paper may be published before the summer Parliamentary recess.This is both an opportunity and a risk. It would be unfortunate if the White Paper pre-empted the big strategic questions on “European preference” decision or related ones on the structure of the new system. Policy first, evidence later is not a good look.However, the new Home Secretary has an ideal opportunity to get ahead of the game on the wider strategy. The Prime Minister’s diktat may mean that he can’t ditch the net migration target – which his predecessor never mentioned if she could possibly help it – entirely. But he could take advantage of the clear consensus within Cabinet to remove the absurd quotas on skilled workers that are keeping out much-needed doctors, and reset policy on international students, including fiddling with the target in some way. Neither of these changes would be controversial anywhere outside Number 10 Downing Street.And at the same time he could signal that he was serious about getting to grips with the Home Office culture, by establishing new presumptions (normal in some other Departments but radical in the Home Office) that the job of civil servants is to administer law and policy sensibly, proportionally and in the interests of the public and holding his officials to account for actually doing that.Pressing the reset button on an immigration policy that has failed in every possible way – economically, politically and morally – would not just be right thing to do, it would be a real boost for “Global Britain”, both at home and abroad.Jonathan Portes is a senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe research group and professor of economics and public policy at King’s College Londonor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And that means we’d be able to sample it,” Ms Turtle told a Nasa briefing.The research, headed by University of Michigan space physicist Xianzhe Jia, was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.The findings support other evidence of plumes from Europa, whose ocean may contain twice the volume of all Earth’s oceans. Nasa’s Hubble space telescope in 2012 collected ultraviolet data suggestive of a plume.Nasa will get a close up look from a new spacecraft during its Europa Clipper mission that could launch as soon as June 2022, providing a possible opportunity to sample plumes for signs of life, perhaps microbial, from its ocean.Europa is considered among the prime candidates for life in our solar system, but is not the only one. For example, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft sampled plumes from Saturn’s ocean-bearing moon Enceladus that contained hydrogen from hydrothermal vents, an environment that may have given rise to life on Earth.A bit smaller than Earth’s moon, Europa’s ocean resides under an ice layer 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 km) thick, with an estimated depth of 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 km).Additional reporting by ReutersThe Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

First discovered by Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe a decade earlier, Kosok had photographed them from the air and realised their true form.Reiche was transfixed by his account and, after visiting the 140 square mile site, committed herself to their study as Kosok\u0027s side, describing the landscape as a huge blackboard where giant hands have drawn clear and precise geometric designs.Spending many nights camping in the desert, Maria became an object of curiosity herself: The locals either thought I was a spy or completely mad. Once a drunk threatened me with a stone, so I took out my sextant and pointed it at him. He ran off screaming, and the next day the local papers ran the story of a mad and armed German spy in their midst.Reiche and Kosok\u0027s study of the Nazca Lines in the 1940s led to the dramatic conclusion that the beasts were actually roughly equivalent to the signs of the zodiac and that they together comprised an early astronomical calendar, mapping out the celestial bodies in the heavens. The geoglyph of a monkey is seen on the plains of the Nazca desert in southern Peru (Reuters)Her book The Mystery of the Pampas (1949) detailed the theory that the giant monkey geoglyph was the Nazca interpretation of the Great Bear constellation, whose movement across the night sky was used to mark time and predict the onset of the rainy season. Her work debunked a myth popularised by Swiss conspiracy theorist Erich von Daniken that they were made by extraterrestrials.Although Reiche\u0027s conclusion has now been largely sidelined in favour of the idea that the geoglyphs served a more earth-bound ceremonial purpose, she nevertheless played a vital role in preserving them, sweeping the lines, preventing vehicles from driving over them and ensuring they received Unesco protected status in 1994.The Lady of the Lines spent her days living in a Nazca tourist hotel, was granted Peruvian citizenship in 1992 and published her complete scientific findings Contributions to Geometry and Astronomy in Ancient Peru in 1993 at the age of 90. She died of ovarian cancer in June 1998, a beloved figure in her adopted homeland.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In essence, just how real are the pictures they take?A number of media outlets published images of Thomas Markle Sr getting measured for his wedding suit, while reading a book on British history, working out with weights in a park, and looking up reports about his daughter\u0027s wedding in an internet cafe. They initially appeared to have been taken by a member of the paparazzi without the retired television lighting engineer\u0027s knowledge. But the Mail on Sunday later published CCTV footage which purported to showed Mr Markle and the photographer entering the internet cafe together.Everything you need to know about the royal weddingLive updates on the build-up to the Royal WeddingThis is what the weather will be like for the royal weddingThe allegations the 74-year-old, who lives in Mexico, cooperated with an LA-based photo agency to stage images of himself getting ready for the wedding have been followed by reports he will not attend the royal wedding at Windsor Castle this Saturday. Mr Markle told TMZ he suffered a heart attack six days ago, but checked himself out of the hospital so he could attend the wedding. But according to the celebrity site, he has “now decided not to go because he doesn’t want to embarrass the royal family or his daughter”. A later report on the site indicated he had changed his mind once more and now intended to walk her down the aisle.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have called for understanding and respect to be given to the Suits actor’s father “in this difficult situation”.The images of Mr Markle raise pertinent questions about paparazzi photos in general and what proportion of such images are actually staged.Jesal Parshotam, a photographer based in London, argues there is a growing number of images which look like they are taken by paparazzi but are actually initiated by the inidual who is being photographed.How much land does the Royal Family actually own?“Often public figures, celebrities or even politicians stage their own images. Sometimes if they want to promote a certain object or fashion line then they will wear a certain item of clothing so they can be photographed in a good way. It is a very frequent thing, he told The Independent. “It is very predominant in the reality TV world but Hollywood stars also do it. When reality TV stars are in a new relationship, they will get photos taken of them.“The main reason is so they can control the images. If you stage photos, it means wider interest in them dies down. It’s about trying to have more autonomy and finding a way for the images to be beneficial for everyone.” Mr Parshotam said he thinks that while many iniduals are duped by staged paparazzi photos and believe they are taken by wholly unconnected paparazzi, others are more discerning.“If you look at the comments section on images online people will say these are staged, they are working with a photographer,” he said.“Henri Cartier-Bresson, a French humanist photographer who is seen to be a master of candid photography, believed the only way you can truly capture someone is if it’s truly candid, he added. In staged photos, they obviously try and make it look as candid as possible.”Land owned by the royal family – in picturesLand owned by the royal family – in picturesMr Parshotam argued that while some newspapers have taken the angle that Mr Markle was trying to make money, his real motivations could lie in wanting to control his public image.This view mirrors remarks made by Meghan’s half-sister, who has admitted to arranging the photo shoots of their father but claimed they were motivated by good intentions. “There’s a lot of scrutiny that it was money motivated, it was not,” Samantha Markle told ITV talk show Loose Women. She also tweeted that it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in an attempt to counter his bad portrayal in the press.The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault,” she tweeted. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money.This echoes the TMZ report which said Mr Markle vented about the fact that at times over the past year he had been ambushed by paparazzo who have taken unflattering pictures and believed the staged photos would alter his public image.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

To date, around 40 structures have been destroyed by the lava.   Giant fissure opens in Hawaii volcano, flinging lava bombs into skyLava spews from fissure in wake of Hawaii volcano eruptionHawaii volcano spatters lava from fissure as Trump declares emergencySmoke billows from lava flows in Hawaii after volcano eruptionHawaii County Civil Defence issued an emergency alert after the fissure was discovered and officials called for more evacuations as fears grew about a potential major eruption at volcano\u0027s summit. More fissures are expected to open among homes and countryside some 25 miles east of Kilauea\u0027s smoking summit, possibly blocking one of the last exit routes, Highway 132.Residents in the immediate area were told to evacuate and two nearby community centres were serving as shelters for people and pets. Lava spread across hundreds of yards of private land and loud explosions rocked the neighbourhood not far from Leilani Estates subision, where more than a dozen other active vents have opened in the past week. I\u0027ve actually seen rocks fly over the tree line and I can feel it in my body, said resident Richard Schott, 34. It\u0027s like a nuclear reaction or something. The US Geological Survey\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said new fissures, ground deformation and abundant volcanic gases indicate eruptions on the eastern flank of Kilauea are likely to continue. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said the pair in coalition held a “clear majority” of the state’s 225 seats.But the more likely scenario would see the state governor offer the BJP the first chance to form a government, as the best-performing single party.The result “certainly bodes well” for Mr Modi in 2019, said Ajay Mehra, a political science lecturer at Delhi University. It gives the BJP control of 22 out of the country’s 29 states – a record number, though the total number of states has grown over the years.India dust storms: Dozens killed as extreme winds hit northern regionsThird Indian teenager raped and burned alive in a weekFeral dogs kill six children and wound dozens more in India attacksIs India’s tourism ‘pro-poor’ if it fails to reduce absolute poverty?Forecasts for more bad weather as ‘freak’ Indian storms kill 143Taj Mahal is turning brown and green, warns India’s Supreme Court The Karnataka vote is the first in a number of important state elections this year, and some commentators suggested the wave of Hindu nationalist sentiment that bore Mr Modi to power in 2014 might already have broken, amid criticism over an overnight ban on high-value banknotes in 2016 and an unpopular nationwide sales tax.But on the best turnout for a state election since the 1950s, that seems not to be the case, and Tuesday’s result makes for grim reading for Congress supporters.“There are lots of middle class Indians who feel each victory for the BJP is making them bolder,” said Mr Mehra. “There is the impression that it is emboldening them to do things they should not be doing – iding society along religious lines.”For Mr Modi’s grassroots supporters, his ability to reach beyond the educated middle classes is one of his strongest appeals. And to do that, Mr Mehra said, the BJP has shown an extraordinary ability to organise and mobilise its political activists to reach into every home.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said in a statement to The Washington Post that it was “stepping up” its efforts to tackle such usage ahead of the 2019 election.Between now and the general election, Mr Modi’s newfound confidence may manifest itself in new economic reforms. The World Bank has called on India to revamp its labour sector and change the rules around land acquisition, things the prime minister has previously been wary of doing.“The result provides some reassurance to the BJP that its popularity remains intact,” Shilan Shah, a senior India economist at Capital Economics, told Reuters. “That could embolden the government to pursue reforms in future, including loosening foreign direct investment restrictions and moves towards privatisation.”And for Congress, the result will raise serious questions about the position of Mr Gandhi, the fifth generation of politicians from the famous Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“His authority is weakened and it is difficult for the Congress now to stake a claim on the leadership of the opposition,” said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.Mr Mehra’s assessment for the party as a whole was bleak. “If they cannot win these elections, in spite of so much anti-government feeling, then Congress appears to be shutting up shop,” he said.Party spokesman Sanjay Jha admitted Congress was “disappointed” by the result but defended Mr Gandhi’s campaigning. “He raised issues that mattered, unlike PM Modi, who indulged in hollow rhetoric,” he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger of being killed once again, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the king-maker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq\u0027s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face-to-face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill-effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse.”Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said that ‘the Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war.”The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqi are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party. Next to Brexit, it is the most important thing for them to fix.Mrs May once said it was her mission to solve the housing crisis.Well, PM, what happened?SEXISM has no place in the workplace.Yet almost a third of women say they have been ordered to dress provocatively by bosses, against their wishes.The Government has issued guidelines to stamp this out.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I said to him to show the world Im getting in shape and getting healthy so I suggested it to benefit him and the Royal family.She said that the paparazzi photos were not money-motivated and any payment would have been a pittance.Meghan has reportedly been pleading with her dad to change his mind and walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but has not been able to speak to Thomas since he made the last-minute decision to no longer attend the nuptials.A source told The Sun: “Meghan is devastated and wants her father to be there.“They’re trying to work this out so he will come after all.”Ladbrokes has since put it at 4/6 odds that Meghans mum Doria will be by her side when she walks down the aisle, while Prince Charles is tipped at 2/1.The Duke of Cambridge has also been tipped to step up to the plate, with 5/1 odds of walking Meghan down the aisle, while there have been a flurry of bets predicting the US actress would walk down the aisle alone.Thomas said he suffered a heart attack six days ago, telling TMZ that he believed the US actress mum Doria, 61, would be a good choice to walk her down the aisle.The yoga instructor, who has already met Prince Harry, is described as a free spirited clinical therapist who has been by her daughters side for  a number of events.She reportedly recently left her job at a mental health facility in Los Angeles, with it unclear what why she made the career change.Last night it was revealed Thomas was going to check back into hospital after suffering more chest pains, having admitted that he had been paid to pose for staged paparazzi pictures.He said he did not want to embarrass either his daughter or the Royals in the wake of his confession.His no-show revelation which came just four days before the wedding at Windsor’s St George’s Chapel, caught the Palace completely by surprise — throwing its plans into chaos.Kensington Palace said last night: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.“She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”But wedding preparations are going on regardless, with flowers today arriving at royal wedding floral designer Philippa Craddocks London store today.The pink and white blooms are expected to decorate the chapel where Harry and Meghan will tie the knot.A pal of the Princes told the Daily Mail: The couple have been doing everything they can to help him.This is not what she wants. She obviously wants her dad there. And the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do.He [Harry] is devastated. He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life - this is the price they have to pay.He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow.Son Thomas Jr, 51, told the Daily Mirror: “Meg will be frantic, she’ll want to know how he is. I’m deeply concerned about him.As much as he was dreading all eyes being on him he will not want to cause any embarrassment or deflect attention away from Meghan and Harry’s day.“He’ll be devastated not to be going but also relieved.”If Meghan walks down the aisle with her mum by her side, it wont be the first time that members of the royal family have been given away by the matriarch of the family.Queen Victoria walked her youngest child, Princess Beatrice, down the aisle at St Mildreds Church, Whippingham, in 1885.Thomas, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, was supposed to be flying to London this week to meet the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Wills and Kate at a lunch ahead of the ceremony.If Thomas does not turn up, Doria will be the bride’s only immediate relative at Saturday’s wedding.But Tracey Dooley, estranged wife of Meghan’s brother Thomas Jr, is already in London with her two sons despite not having an invite with the trio set to appear on Good Morning Britain as part of the shows wedding coverage."},{"url":null,"title":"michaella mccollum reveals she has had twins in instagram post","story":"One half of the infamous Peru Two drug mules shared the news that her two kids are one week old today.Michaella posted a short video of herself holding the two babies, writing: My little darlings, 1 week today.She has remained tight-lipped about who the father is since announcing her pregnancy earlier in the year.The new mum, 24, appeared to still be in hospital when the clip was filmed as medical equipment can be seen on her hand.It hasnt been confirmed what sex the tots are, but one person congratulated her on the birth of two girls in the comments.But she hinted at the baby daddys identity in an April social media snap which left tongues wagging.It showed both her and a male pal wearing white spa gowns and matching slippers.Since being released she has enjoyed a string of holidays abroad - after queuing up at the dole office in her home town of Dungannon, Northern Ireland.She captioned her post: Wow had some crazy dreams... guess thats what happens when your dreaming for more than one.Michaella had previously fuelled both pregnancy and engagement rumours when spotted shopping for childrens clothes at Jojo Maman Bebe in Belfast while wearing a ring.Michaella spent more than two years in jail on cocaine smuggling charges in 2013.She was jailed for six years in December 2013 after admitting trying to smuggle 11kg of cocaine out of the country alongside Scottish pal Melissa Reid.More to follow...For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-life stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

It was not for money.It is now not clear who will walk Meghan down the aisle, although the 73-year-old has reportedly said he is happy for his ex-wife and Meghans mother Doria to take on the role.The Mail On Sunday reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of Royal Wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.TMZ first reported that Meghans father had pulled out of the wedding.The site stated that it had spoken to the US actress father, saying: Hes now decided not to go because he doesnt want to embarrass the Royal Family or his daughter.The statement issued by Kensington Palace indicates the concern Harry and Meghan feel for Mr Markle who is likely to be at the centre of intense media scrutiny in the coming days.The former lighting director was due to meet the Queen with Meghans mother Doria Ragland in the days leading up to the wedding being staged at St Georges Chapel at the castle.And at the same event he would have been introduced to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.Meghans father met her mother on the set of the US soap General Hospital, where he worked as a lighting director when she was a temp in the studio.

MPs have voted twice to reject a backward-looking, disproportionate and costly Leveson 2 inquiry.We would now urge the House of Lords to respect the wishes of the elected House.The Government win came after Culture Secretary Matt Hancock vowed to carry out a regular review of how the media handles sensitive data in a last-ditch attempt to head off a Commons rebellion.He also said ministers would act if the press self-regulation regime appeared to stop working well in future.Mr Hancock told MPs: “We have gone out of our way to offer concessions at every stage to make sure the system of press regulation is both free and fair.What we propose with this set of amendments is that this house can continue to debate and scrutinise the effectiveness of the self-regulation of the press, without requiring statutory regulation which we seek to avoid.Now is the time to look forward, not back and come together to build a vibrant, free and fair press that holds the powerful to account and rises to the challenges of our time.He was speaking after the House of Lords last night voted to hold a re-run of the Leveson Inquiry even though it had already been rejected by the Commons.Peers decision to back a controversial amendment to the Data Protection Bill meant that MPs had to vote again even though theyd already rejected the plans.Last week, the Commons narrowly voted against an almost identical amendment, proposed by ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband.But the margin of victory was just nine votes - raising hopes among anti-press campaigners that they could win over enough MPs to change the result second time around.Mr Hancocks last-minute offer of a new amendment enshrining regular reviews of the media was designed to convince the Commons there is no need for a full-blown inquiry which could drag on for years.It seemed to work - as the Governments winning margin increased from nine votes to 12.Speaking as MPs debated this afternoon, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said anti-press campaigners only wanted to get even with the media by holding a Leveson re-run.Tory MP Peter Bone - one of five Conservative rebels in last week’s vote - switched sides in today’s vote.He suggested that it was wrong for the Lords to defy the wishes of the Commons because Theresa May vowed not to hold a “Leveson 2” inquiry in her election manifesto last year.The only Tory rebels today were veteran Ken Clarke, Crispin Blunt and Philip Hollobone, as Dominic Grieve chose to abstain rather than opposing the Government.Senior backbencher John Redwood said in the Commons that the peers’ vote was “rather undemocratic”, adding: “They dont like results of referendums, they dont like the EU Withdrawal Bill... and now they want to regulate the press because the press points out the errors of their ways.”The Lords vote came despite senior peers warning their colleagues they risked undermining Britain’s tradition of the free press by holding a re-run of the inquiry.VOTED IN FAVOUR OF LEVESON 2 (291)Diane Abbott (Labour - Hackney North and Stoke Newington)ABSTAINED IN TODAYS VOTE (44)Ian Austin (Labour, Dudley North) - PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LEVESON 2(Note: those abstaining includes MPs unable to vote because they are absent or ill. Does not include the Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, who dont vote, or seven Sinn Fein MPs, who refuse to take their seats.)Viscount Colville said: “Even the prospect of the bar being raised will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism.”And Lord Hunt added: “I suspect what lies behind this amendment is yet another attempt to exercise some statutory controls or levers over our free media.”The House of Lords will technically be able to push the Leveson 2 amendment again when the bill returns from the Commons - but it is highly unlikely they will seek to defy MPs for a second time.Despite being a well-paid columnist until last year, he hates newspapers for revealing he had an affair using his government-owned flat.LORD KERSLAKE: The former head of the civil service now advises Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, but press revealed he was nicknamed “Bungalow Bob” by staff as there was “not much upstairs.”Never far from the headlines after his bungling in Whitehall and later as an NHS Trust chief.PETER HAIN:The Labour arch-remoaner was forced to resign as Transport Secretary in 2008 in a scandal about undeclared donations from rich donors.He was left red faced after he put an expensive new roof for his “log store” on his expenses.LORD MENDELSOHN:The Labour big-hitter was forced to quit the frontbench in January after the press revealed he attended the controversial President’s Club Ball.Female waitresses were groped and harrassed at the all-male charity dinner that rocked the City.LORD MACLEAN:The former Tory whip led the charge to have MPs exempt from Freedom of Information laws when he was in the Commons.And he was a key player in trying to block the publication of MPs expenses ahead of the devastating 2009 scandal.BARONESS CHAKRABARTI: Corbynista peer Shami was accused of whitewashing antisemitism in the Labour Party in a duff report published shortly before she was ennobled.Exposed as a hypocrite for sending her son to £18,000-per-year private school after attacking grammar schools for being unfair."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406035415.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sichuan airlines pilot sucked out cockpit window","story":"Liu Chuanjian is being hailed a hero on Chinese social media after landing the Sichuan Airlines flight manually after his colleague was pulled back into the cabin.He told the Chengdu Economic Daily that the Airbus A319 had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet when a deafening sound tore through the cabin.The cockpit experienced a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature and when he looked over, the right windshield was gone.Liu spoke of the terrifying moment he realised his colleague had been sucked out of the window.He said: There was no warning sign. Suddenly, the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang.“The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window.Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned - and I couldnt hear the radio.“The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in and miraculously only suffered scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.Officials confirmed that none of the planes 119 passengers or any of the other cabin crew were injured in the nightmarish descent .Authorities said Frances BEA accident investigation agency and Airbus would send staff to China to investigate.Sichuan Airlines Flight 3U8633 left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.It made its emergency landing in the south west city of Chengdu.An unnamed passenger told Chinese media: “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake.“We didnt know what was going on and we panicked.“Then the oxygen masks dropped... we experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilised again.Im still nervous.

One week its one thing, one week its the next.“Everyone would like to see a fast resolution, a united front, and some leadership thats united rather than split.The 74-year-old singer was making a rare foray into politics, although he did release two politically charged songs last year, moaning about Brexit and Donald Trump.And in the same interview this morning his Stones bandmate Keith Richards revealed the band’s angry run-in with US President, which led him to pull out his “trusty blade”.The guitarist said Mr Trump was their promoter for a concert in Atlantic City, but added: “It was (billed as) Donald Trump presents the Rolling Stones, (which was) in miniature.We never have much to do with promoters usually, but this one got me. That was the last time I got angry. I pulled out my trusty blade, stuck it in the table and said, Youve got to get rid of this man!Mr Richards added: Now America has to get rid of him. Dont say I didnt warn you.It means there are no tariffs on goods going between EU states, and they all enforce the same standards for goods imported from outside Europe.Some pro-EU politicians want Britain to stay in the customs unionafter Brexit - but that has been ruled out by Theresa May, because it would stop us striking any new trade deals with the rest of the world.Last year, the PM set out two possible paths for the future customs relationship between Britain and Europe.One option is the customs partnership - which would mirror many aspects of the existing customs union.It would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods which enter Britain on their way to the continent.The advantage of that would be no border checks would be needed between the UK and EU, particularly on the key Irish border, but Brexiteers worry it would tie us too closely to Europe.The alternative is known as maximum facilitation - a hi-tech arrangement where automated systems check goods as they flow across borders in a way which helps business trade freely.But EU bosses have cast doubt on whether the right technology exists to make that solution work.While the row may seem technical, many Brexit backers regard it as crucial for the UK to take total control of our trade and customs arrangements, or risk making our EU departure pointless.Theresa May faces a major challenge finding a solution which is acceptable for both hardline Eurosceptics and the pro-EU Tory rebels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

driven.At the moment the average temperature looks like 19C to 20C (68F) but up to 23C is possible.The amount of sunshine and cloud cover will determine whether we get those upper temperatures.Most of the UK is expected to share in the fine and dry weather but there is a chance of some rain as it become cloudier and breezier in far north-western parts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000344205750.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"180 social network rely five","story":"Researchers who carried out a poll of 1,500 adults revealed partners are most likely to be in the circle of trust, along with parents and siblings.It also emerged we turn to the trusted inner circle for help or support at least twice a month.The study was commissioned by American Express to celebrate the launch of its new brand campaign and understand more about how the support of others can help propel you forward.Digital entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, who is working with American Express on the launch of its new campaign, said: “Having the support of others can be instrumental to success, but it’s not always about having friends in high places.Support can come from anywhere and more often than not it’s people you’ve known all your life.’’The study also found for nearly half of Brits (47 per cent) this social support network has become more important today than ever before.More than a third put this down to busier lives while 28 per cent blamed an increased pressure to succeed.According to the data, Brits believe having a support network around you is one of the most important factors to self-achievement.Additionally, the research identified the support network is primarily made up of a “backer” (64 per cent), a “comforter” (62 per cent) and a “cheerleader” (62 per cent).It also consists of a “constructive critic” (45 per cent) and a “big picture thinker” (40 per cent).Jamal Edwards, who is also the founder of SBTV, a British company run by a small team of young people working on web-based content, added:  “I’ve relied on my parents more than anyone else.“They’ve helped back me on many occasions and given me the encouragement to get to where I am today.“For example, they bought me my first camera for Christmas when I was 15 which is when I really got into making videos and I became inseparable from the camera.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406342496.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds best engagement photos 2018","story":"The winning

markle dad thomas royal wedding wants walk aisle","story":"Thomas Markle has told TMZ he does want to make the trip, but his doctors might not let him travel due to recent health scares.Mr Markle earlier appeared to back his ex-wife Doria Ragland to be by their daughters side this Saturday after pulling out of the royal wedding last minute.That came following the revelation he had been paid to pose for paparazzi pictures.But he now appears to have backtracked, saying: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.He revealed he missed Meghans earlier phone calls but added shed messaged him to say she loved him and was concerned about his health.The 73-year-old dismissed the idea of the Queen being upset with him, saying: I dont think the Queen is thinking about what Im doing.What we know so far...It was earlier reported the father of the bride intended to check back into hospital after suffering more chest pains.And it was thought Meghan had been unable to contact her father since his decision to pull out.Thomas, who said he had a heart attack a week ago, insisted he would not walk Meghan down the aisle for fear of embarrassing her or the royals.Prince Harry was said to be blaming himself over the last-minute hitch - with Meghan pleading with her dad to change his mind.A source earlier told The Sun: “Meghan is devastated and wants her father to be there. They’re trying to work this out so he will come after all.”Another pal told The Daily Mail that reclusive Thomas was not in a good place after the picture deal was revealed.They said: (Meghan) obviously wants her dad there and the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do.Thomas initial no-show decision, just four days before the wedding at Windsor’s St George’s Chapel, caught the Palace completely by surprise - throwing its plans into chaos.Kensington Palace said last night: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.“She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”Thomas, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, was due to fly to London this week to meet the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Wills and Kate at a lunch ahead of the ceremony.But instead, it seemed Meghan might have to rely on her mother Doria to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day.It is understood Meghan, 36, had already asked her to be on standby in case Thomas was too unwell to come to the UK.The photographs which caused the initial upset showed Thomas in Rosarito reading a book on British history, working out with weights, being measured for a wedding suit and looking up Harry and Meghan at an internet café.The pictures were sold around the world — before the Mail On Sunday revealed they had been staged.Thomas admitted in the interview that the staged paparazzi pictures looked “stupid and hammy.”His confession is embarrassing for Kensington Palace, which had issued strong legal letters in an attempt to protect Thomas’s privacy.A source said: “Tom was really upset when he was photographed looking unkempt and dishevelled earlier this year.“He thought they made him look like a lush and he wanted a more positive image of him out there.“So that’s why he colluded with the picture agency and photographer to do better shots.”Thomas admitted accepting money from agency Coleman Rayner for the pictures.The chaos has also hit Prince Harry hard, with a pal telling the Daily Mail: He [Harry] is devastated. He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life - this is the price they have to pay.He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow.Thomas was pictured driving away from his home last Wednesday and staying the night at a motel in San Diego after crossing the US border.The next day, Thursday, he lifted two heavy pots of flowering plants and put them on Doria’s door step in Los Angeles along with a card.He was seen driving around LA, visiting the post office, pharmacy and bank before heading back to Mexico that evening.Thomas’s daughter Samantha, Meghan’s estranged half-sister, said the posed pictures were her idea.Samantha, not invited to the wedding, told ITV’s Loose Women she said: “My father doing staged photos is my fault.“I suggested he do positive photos. It was not for money.”She said she had no idea if he had been paid but added: “If he was it would have been a pittance. I’m entirely the culprit.I said to him to show the world ‘I’m getting in shape and getting healthy’ so I suggested it to benefit him and the Royal family.”Thomas’s grandson Tyler Dooley, 25, yesterday said his granddad had suggested only on Sunday that he would be at the wedding.He said: “My grandfather is in pieces – he is broken. He is not doing well.“He is a very reclusive guy — he has been in the spotlight his entire life behind the cameras and now he has been thrusted into all this with the Royals.“It is overwhelming. My grandfather just wants to be left alone — he wants the peace and the quiet back.”Tyler, a debt recovery worker, said of his Sunday discussion with Thomas: “He emailed me and I emailed him back.“He said he’s had some serious complications because of the stress, anxiety and pressure. I was also told that he had a heart attack. He had a pretty big health scare.“He told me that he loves me very much and he’s sorry about everything that’s happening.“He said he plans to get the care and the help he needs after the wedding — which told me that he was going.”Tyler said he believed Thomas would change his mind again and go to the ceremony — because he loves Meghan so much.He added: “There is no way he is not going to go to that wedding. That is his daughter and she loves him more than anything in the world.“I couldn’t be more proud of Meghan — she is everything to me.“She knows she has a big support base behind her and that’s all she needs to know.”If Thomas does not turn up, Doria will be the bride’s only immediate relative at Saturday’s wedding.But Tracey Dooley, estranged wife of Meghan’s brother Thomas Jr, is already in London with her two sons despite not having an invite.The three are set to appear on Good Morning Britain as part of the show’s Royal wedding coverage."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406401224.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"two headed baby deer found minnesota forest","story":"The conjoined white-tailed fawns found in a Minnesota forest two years ago were stillborn and are the first recorded case of such a deformity being carried to term.The study was recently published in the science journal American Midland Naturist and the fawns have since been mounted on a bed of greenery by a taxidermist.Lou Cornicelli, co-author of the study and a wildlife research manager for Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), told Fox News: Its never been described before.There are a few reported cases of two-headed ungulate fetuses, but nothing delivered to term. So the uniqueness made it special.In two previous cases of conjoined white-tailed deer fawns, neither made it through the full pregnancy.The discovery was made in May 2016 when a man came across the twins about a mile from the Mississippi River in Freeburg in south-eastern Minnesota.He contacted the states DNR and the body was subsequently frozen until an autopsy could be performed.A CT scan and MRI revealed the fawns had two separate head and neck regions, which rejoined along the spine.Internally the fawns had a shared liver, extra spleens, and gastrointestinal tracts, according to co-author Gino DAngelo, a researcher at the University of Georgia.DAngelo told UGA Today: Their anatomy indicates the fawns would never have been viable.Yet they were found groomed and in a natural position, suggesting the doe tried to care for them after delivery.The maternal instinct is very strong.Conjoined twins are commonly found in domestic animals, such as  this mutant piglet born in China last year, though it is rare to see it in wild animals.But last summer trawlers were shocked to pick up a dead two-headed porpoise off the coast of the Netherlands.Similarly, scientists were baffled to find perfectly preserved conjoined bats under a tree in Brazil.The two-headed baby deer has been mounted as if it is just waking up from a nap and will eventually be put on display at the headquarters of Minnesota DNR.Cornicelli added: We all thought it was pretty near and were glad to be able to show it to the public."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/462a3d7a0f8fe5bef070a3c9fd3e816bf2f66789ccaec980a47b4ffd055cc3a4_4304202.jpg?20180508183530 ","title":"how vodafone was shaped into a behemoth","story":"The second Vodafone chief executive, who succeeded Sir Gerry at the end of 1996, was Sir Chris Gent, a prot\u0026#233g\u0026#233 of Sir Ernie Harrison, the East End docker\u0027s son who as chairman had taken Racal into telecoms in the first place.His period at the helm is remembered as a period of swashbuckling global expansion, during which Vodafone first moved into the US in a big way with the 1999 acquisition of Airtouch, for $66bn.This was followed a year later by what remains the biggest takeover ever done by a British company - the $183bn acquisition of German mobile operator Mannesmann, which put itself in play after agreeing to buy Orange in the UK, going back on a gentleman\u0027s agreement that the two companies had not to encroach on each other\u0027s turf.As required by the EU\u0027s competition authorities, Vodafone subsequently sold Orange to France Telecom, which today trades under the Orange name.Sir Chris was subsequently criticised for overpaying for Mannesmann, the deal having been done at the height of the bubble in telecoms, media and technology stocks, but his genius was in using Vodafone shares as its acquisition currency rather than cash.That not only meant Vodafone rode out the later downturn in the sector because, unlike some rivals that had used cash to do deals, its balance sheet was not as heavily geared. It also meant the company\u0027s by-then prodigious cash-flow - augmented by the sale of unwanted assets - could be invested in upgrading and expanding its networks, rather than having to be spent on servicing debt.Sir Chris\u0027s time is also associated with heavy investment in 3G licences around Europe.It was a thrilling time to be covering the company\u0027s fortunes and the soundtrack to it all was Bohemian Like You, a track by the US band The Dandy Warhols, which became ubiquitous as Vodafone became one of the world\u0027s heaviest-spending advertisers.When Sir Chris stepped down, in 2003, it fell to his Indian-born successor, Arun Sarin, to make all that investment pay off."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-israeli-forces-tear-gas_4310455.jpg?20180514205630 ","title":"israeli bullets didnt seem to frighten any gazans","story":"Men, women, teenagers and sometimes children would simply stay where they were, or would keep moving forwards.Israel has portrayed the protests as a Hamas project it claims it is sending people to the fence knowing they will get hurt to provoke international outrage against the Jewish state.It also accuses the group of using the demonstrations as a cover for terrorism.I asked dozens of protesters if this was the case.

More than 40,000 people took to the streets of Gaza to demonstrate against the controversial opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. On Tuesday, Palestinians were observing a general strike to mourn those killed in the deadliest day in Gaza since the 2014 war. Middle East minister Alistair Burt said that moving the US HQ from Tel Aviv was not backed by the UK and that the government did not see it as being conducive at present in the region to the peace. He told MPs: The United Kingdom supports an independent investigation into what has happened. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told MPs that there had been an apparent calculated and deliberate policy to kill and maim unarmed protesters, who posed no threat to the forces on the Gaza border. She said: Many of them shot in the back. Many of them shot hundreds of metres from the border, and many of them children.  Ministers could not say whether arms sold to Israel by the UK had been used to fire on Palestinians at the border.  Labour MP Richard Burden said the Government had written to him to say it did not collect data on the use of equipment after sale when he challenged them to investigate how sniper rifles and other weapons exported under licences from the UK to Israel were used. He said: Doesn\u0027t that answer mean the Government hasn\u0027t the first idea whether UK weapons are being used to shoot demonstrators in Gaza, and what does it take for the UK to enforce its own arms export criteria and stop arms sales to Israel?  Mr Burt said a proper risk assessment takes place before sales are considered, adding: Since the start of the recent difficulties in Gaza we have looked at all existent licences in relation to Israel and our sense at the moment is we\u0027ve no information to suggest that UK-supplied equipment has been used against protesters.  Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said peaceful Gaza protests have been exploited by extremists but urged Israel to show restraint in using live fire after violence claimed scores of lives. More protesters are expected today on Nakba Day (Catastrophe Day) which marks the 70th anniversary that saw thousands of Palestinians flee amid the creation of Israel in 1948. Alistair Burt said the tragedies should be used as an opportunity for a springboard to peace. Ministers discussed the situation in Gaza at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet where Theresa May urged both sides to show restraint and refrain from any further violence.

Sajid Javid revealed the shock figure in a grilling by the Commons Home Affairs Committee. It comes just weeks after Mr Javid, whose predecessor Amber Rudd resigned over the scandal, said he was not aware of any Windrush citizens being wrongly deported. Furious Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: The responsibility for these wrongful deportations stops at Theresa May\u0027s door. Apologies are not enough for the lives that have been ruined and the deep hurt and pain that communities have suffered. Campaigning MP David Lammy added: This is the worst human rights and home affairs crisis in my time in politics. The Prime Minister\u0027s hostile environment stands in the dock, guilty as charged. The 63 people are Caribbean nationals who were removed from the UK since records began in 2002, and who are also over the age of 45.  Their age means some of them might have arrived in Britain before 1973 - a legal cut-off date. Under UK law, anyone who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 should have had an automatic right to stay in Britain, so should not be deported. Home Office officials do not yet know how many of the 63 should have been protected under Windrush law.  Only last week the Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes, said she had not yet found a single wrongful deportation of a Windrush citizen. Her officials also suggested only a handful of people - five - had been wrongly deported from Britain at all in the last five years, even beyond the Windrush scandal. Yet today Mr Javid suggested the final total could be even higher than 63, telling MPs: It\u0027s not a final number at this point - it could change. The work on those records is still ongoing.  Of the 63 citizens, Mr Javid said 32 were removed because they committed crimes. The other 31 were administrative removals, which includes people who were sent Home Office letters telling them to leave. The cases were found in an ongoing trawl of 8,000 Home Office records on people deported from the UK since 2002. Mr Javid confirmed: Out of the 8,000, there\u0027s so far a focus on 63 where there\u0027s something on their record that indicates they could have been in the UK before 1973.  The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks.

It\u0027s thought that the pink and white flowers are being sent to Windsor now even though it\u0027s four days until Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday.  The flowers were spotted being carried into a truck in boxes outside Philippa Craddock\u0027s London depot, the florist preparing flowers for the Royal Wedding. Photographs show the decorations being organised by a group of people helping each other carefully carry the boxes. The sighting comes as businesses in Windsor prepare their shop windows - and memorabilia sellers pop up around the town.    has previously reported the flowers in St George\u0027s Chapel and at the formal reception which follows will be provided by self-taught florist Philippa Craddock.   She said she\u0027d work with florists from St George\u0027s Chapel and Buckingham Palace to turn white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves into show-stopping creations.  Philippa provides flowers for weddings, events and brand campaigns.  At the time, Philippa said in an Instagram post: I am thrilled to share with you that we have been asked by Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle to create their wedding flowers in May.   I am loving working with them, it is an incredible privilege, and the designs will be a true reflection of them as a couple, with sustainability at the forefront. We will be using plenty of locally sourced greenery and seasonal flowers including peonies, garden roses and foxgloves.  Some of the foliage was expected to be gathered from The Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park, with beech, birch and hornbeam expected to feature. The flower arrangements will focus on flowers that are in season in May, and will have a wild feel - with bee-friendly plants from the Royal Parks\u0027 wildflower meadows set to be incorporated.

Thomas Markle Snr, 73, remains in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just four days away.  He had been expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but last night it was claimed he no longer plans to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi amid reports he had suffered a heart attack last week.  It\u0027s now emerged that the royal family were allegedly caught flatfooted when the news that he would not be attending broke last night, TMZ reports.  It added that up until that point the Palace had been planning a security detail, accommodation and access to events for the father of the bride. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims that it was blindsided by the news when approached by MirrorOnline. The news has cast light on not just Thomas Snr but the wider Markle family - who were completely unknown until they were cast into the limelight when Meghan got engaged to Prince Harry.   Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland could walk the American actress down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle if Mr Markle doesn\u0027t attend the ceremony.   He claims he hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan, 36, since reports emerged that he had decided not to attend the wedding.   Mr Markle told TMZ he\u0027s been popping Valium to ease his chest pains after suffering a heart attack, and he could return to hospital as early as Monday night.   Mr Markle told the website he suffered a heart attack six days ago and his new chest pains have been triggered by emotional upset. Reports suggest some plans for the wedding have been thrown into turmoil with Mr Markle deciding to stay put at home. Mr Markle allegedly sold the paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000, and admitted to TMZ that he was paid for the images.     It was claimed Harry is blaming himself after Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, reportedly pulled out of the wedding.  Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father, and has reportedly begged him to change his mind and walk her down the aisle as planned in front of 600 guests and a TV audience of millions. Harry and Meghan released a statement Monday night to address reports that Mr Markle wouldn\u0027t attend the ceremony.  A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation. In an interview with TMZ, Mr Markle called out his oldest daughter, Meghan\u0027s estranged half-sister Samantha Markle, who has criticised the Suits actress and claimed she was to blame for the paparazzi controversy. He added: I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.  The pensioner, who lives in the Pacific coastal city of Rosarito, Mexico, fears he will suffer a third heart attack, it was claimed.  Piers Morgan lashed out at Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.  He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles. Samantha, who suffers from MS, has claimed she wasn\u0027t invited to divorcee Meghan\u0027s first wedding - on a beach in Jamaica - because of her wheelchair.  The 53-year-old revealed she hasn\u0027t spoken to her sister since 2015.  She has also previously blasted the royal wedding guest list by claiming that she had shunned her own family in favour of thousands of complete strangers.  Meghan\u0027s estranged half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr, 50, wrote an open letter begging to be invited to the wedding, despite telling Harry to call it off.

Mary Crumpton, 44, lives with legal husband Tim and boyfriend John Hulls, 53, who she unofficially wed during a \u0027commitment ceremony\u0027 at the Unitarian Church in Chorlton, Manchester, earlier this month. The 44-year-old has two more boyfriends - Michael, 63, and 73-year-old James - who live just down the road. Mary was walked up the aisle by her 43-year-old husband. The second-time bride wore a white dress and celebrated with family and friends at a 100-strong reception. The 44-year-old last month spoke publicly about her relationships in the hope of allowing others to understand people who follow the practice polyamory. She told the Sun: It was a lovely day. Tim said a few words to bless mine and John\u0027s commitment to one another. We couldn\u0027t sign legal documents as polygamy is illegal in this country but in all other respects the ceremony was conducted like a normal wedding. Polyamory is having more than one relationship and is different from having more than one spouse.   Polyamorous couple reveal what it\u0027s really like to be in a marriage with three people  Speaking last month, Mary said: I was brought up in quite a traditional home. I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind. In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life. At the time I didn’t really question having just one partner. It was normal. I did sometimes have feelings for other people, but I felt guilty about doing so and just took it as a sign that I didn’t love my husband enough. When the marriage didn’t work out, I met someone else, and started a monogamous relationship with him. The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner. I had never come across it before, or the term ‘polyamory’ which means ‘more-than-one love’. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them. My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted. A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person. I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us. I took to it immediately. I had a friend that I was already close to and that friendship drifted very naturally into something more. My partner had a similar experience with a friend of his. It was a revelation to me. I quickly realised that I had been ‘wired up’ this way probably all my life - loving more than one person now seems like the most natural thing in the world to me and I can’t imagine being any other way. For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.  She continued: I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous. I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I have a partner, John, 53, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to ‘marry’ this year. We can’t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May. Both men are straight and have been brought together through Mary. They have all lived together since 2015. Mary has another two other partners, Michael, 63, who she has been with since 2016 and James, 73.  Mary said: John has been living with me and my husband in our house in Chorlton since 2015. He has a flat a few streets away from my house and I usually stay over at his place once or twice a week, and sometimes he stays at mine. Michael spent Christmas with us and we had a really special day together. Last but not least, I am with James, 73, who I bonded with while watching football games in the pub together in 2015. My husband and John have no interest in football, so it is nice to have someone to share that interest with. One of the lovely things about a life with more than one partner is that there is no pressure on one person to supply all my needs. My husband Tim and I share an enthusiasm for environmentalism and all that entails, like electric cars, and veganism. With my fianc\u0026eacute John I enjoy watching science-fiction and we go to church together. With Michael, I like to watch and support him playing for his local darts team at the Royal Oak, and we go to karaoke nights - which is possibly more embarrassing than admitting to polyamory. Living in a house with more than one partner is something I have done for a number of years now. I suppose in many ways it is no different from living in a shared house with a group of friends, or family. All the usual things about whose turn it is to wash up etc. Tim and John get on well, I suppose a bit like brothers, going on bicycle rides together for example. So it seems to work okay. They have something in common in that they both love me of course, and friends joke that I need two of them to keep me in-line. Like in any relationship, insecurities can arise. Though in some ways there is less jealousy perhaps - no fear that a partner might cheat on me because why lie about it when having another partner is allowed anyway? Sometimes there might be a fear that a new partner is ‘better’ in some way than a current one, but good communication and offering reassurances allows that to be dealt with.  In many ways I have found that being in open relationships has forced me to communicate much better. I am very honest and open with my partners about my feelings and needs, in a way that I didn’t have the courage to be in previous monogamous relationships. So I think I have grown as a person, and have better and stronger relationships now. Of course, all of that is possible in monogamous relationships, and I am not suggesting polyamory is in any way better, just different. But it works well for me personally. I don’t have children, and have no desire to have children. I see no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up though, because I have seen co-parenting work really well for other polyamorous groups. It is not something we plan though. Mostly people have been great. They had lots of questions about it, and some family members needed reassurance that we were all happy and no-one was getting hurt. I find that I have a huge capacity for romantic love. I just naturally fall in love with more than one person at a time. So to settle down with just one person for the rest of my life just doesn’t feel natural to me. People sometimes ask me if it means that I love my husband, or any of my partners less. And I say no. Perhaps it is a bit like how we love our children - when a parent has a second or third child, it doesn’t mean that they love their first child any the less. I think that romantic love is unlimited too. Time is limited of course. But I do not believe that love is. It certainly isn’t for me. I get different reactions. Most people are interested and people often say ‘I wish my wife/husband would let me do that’. I sometimes get negative reactions too - I have been called a slapper or a slag. I think that negativity mostly arises because I am doing something a bit different and sometimes that can make people feel uncomfortable.

Said to be happy in his own company, shy and intensely private, fast-foward 12 months and Markle has found himself the focus of intense scrutiny and embarrassment over staging photos for the paparazzi .  In the wake of these revelations and the subsequent upset, Markle has said he will no longer be attending his daughter\u0027s wedding. He was meant to be walking her down the aisle. As distressing as this is for Meghan, it\u0027s not an isolated incident.  Royal weddings and cold feet go hand-in-hand.   Given the sheer amount of attention and the glaring spotlight these events attract, it\u0027s perhaps not that surprising. Just under 37 years ago, both Charles and Diana were expressing their doubts over whether they wanted to go ahead with what turned out to be the wedding of the century.   Catherine Mayer, author of Charles: The Heart of a King , interviewed various members of the prince\u0027s inner circle who revealed the turmoil he was in the night before his wedding.   Apparently a desperate Charles confided in that I can\u0027t go through with it...I can\u0027t do it to an aide, the  reports.

But Charles wasn\u0027t the only one harbouring serious doubts. In an extract from Andre Morton\u0027s now infamous 1992 biography of Diana, it seems she was also wanting to back out.

The mother bought an adult and child train ticket to Windsor at a packed Slough train station full of morning commuters but walked to an empty platform where no trains were due to stop. Train driver David Campbell-Kinder said he saw the 46-year-old bending down to talk to 10-year-old Amaar before climbing onto the tracks with him in her arms and laying down as horrified commuters watched. Just seconds later, the pair were hit and killed by the 8.41am Bedwyn to London Paddington service at about 9.45am. Amaar\u0027s backpack full of school books was found by officers on a bench on the platform, their inquest heard today.  In a statement read to the Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford at Reading coroner\u0027s court, her brother Zahire Khan said he was surprised to see the pair on September 23 when he stopped and spoke to them just 30 minutes before they died. I was surprised to see her as I had never seen her in town before and it was a school day and Amaar was with her, he said. They were surprised to see me as well, but a nice unexpected surprise and we stopped and had a brief chat. Amaar appeared to be happy and excited and I asked \u0027what are you lot doing here?\u0027 Rubina smiled and said she had an appointment with her dentist in London and Amaar had the day off. I just said \u0027okay\u0027 and then waved and said our goodbyes and walked off in opposite directions.

Student Lucy White, 24, suffered a seizure caused by a toxic mix of cocaine and prescription drugs in her system. The seizure starved her brain of oxygen for more than 40 minutes as her partner cooked dinner in the next room. Lucy\u0027s older sister Stacey Jordan, 28, rushed to her bedside - finding her hooked up to wires and tubes - after receiving a terrible phone call in the middle of the night of May 3. Stacey has now shared the heart-wrenching photos of the top marks criminology student to warn others about the dangers of drugs.  Her social media post went viral with more than 200,000 likes and shares as Stacey bravely told the world her sister, who had previously volunteered for drugs charities, was dead and had donated her organs on May 7. She included pictures of a deeply personal letter Lucy had written to her last summer in which she thanked her for always being there and vowed to repay her one day. Stacey said: Anyone would say she was like a sunshine - her hair was bright blonde, and she was always smiling. She used to be terrified of getting into trouble. She didn\u0027t even drink that much. I can\u0027t believe it. She tried to make a difference in everyone\u0027s life, she helped everybody - and she was just happy.  I hate what has happened so much. She was clever, and she had everything going for her until, obviously, she didn\u0027t. Lucy, who was studying at the University of the West of England, was looking forward to getting her degree in the summer and had volunteered with the Bristol Drugs Project to help recovering addicts get clean. But after getting involved with the wrong crowd and finding herself dabbling in drugs, she suddenly dropped out of university and lost contact with many of her closest friends and family in January. Stacey claims doctors told her tests confirmed Lucy had taken cocaine and powerful prescription drug pregabalin when she suffered a seizure. She collapsed at home while partner Ian O\u0027Donoghue was cooking a pie in the next room. He called the ambulance and started CPR. Despite being rushed to intensive care at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, Lucy tragically died four days later.  Stacey, a security officer, said: I got a call in the middle of the night and it was just my nan screaming down the phone saying \u0027It\u0027s Lucy, it\u0027s Lucy, she\u0027s nearly died\u0027. When I got there, the doctor said a 24-year-old doesn\u0027t just collapse and have a seizure for no reason, she must have taken something. The doctors first said that she\u0027s going to be severely brain damaged, and then they said they thought she was brain stem dead. Once you\u0027re brain stem dead there\u0027s no reversal from that, there\u0027s no getting better, it\u0027s just that. When the tests confirmed it, I wanted to spend the last of her time here with her on my own. I just sat by her bedside and held her hand. According to Stacey, Lucy fell in with the wrong crowd in May last year when peer pressure, anxiety and loneliness during the summer drove her to cocaine and her life spun out of control.  Stacey, from Bristol, said: I got a message from her ex-boyfriend who told me she had started taking drugs and he was really worried about her. Lucy and I were about to go on holiday together, so I decided to wait until we were there to confront her. I hadn\u0027t seen her in a while - obviously she didn\u0027t want me to see her - and she looked like an absolute mess. She had lost so much weight and she was so skinny. She usually has her eyebrows, lashes and nails done, but she didn\u0027t look right. I just said to her \u0027I know everything, you need to tell me now\u0027 and she started crying and couldn\u0027t breathe. She said she was sorry that she didn\u0027t tell me, and I was furious, but I basically said \u0027I\u0027m going to help you, but you\u0027ve got to help yourself\u0027. I told her I\u0027d help her get clean but that she had to stay away from the people taking drugs.

Remarkably, this is LESS than the \u0026pound48,500 which the current owner paid for it in 2007 after it appeared on an episode of the Antiques Roadshow the year before. East Bristol Auctions will be selling the script on June 1 - and with a \u0026pound40,000 guide price tag is potentially the most valuable item the Hanham-based saleroom has ever auctioned.  Andrew Stowe, from East Bristol Auctions, said: This script is one of the most thrilling items we\u0027ve ever had. It\u0027s an absolute icon of British comedy. When it first came in to us, I was shaking with delight. \u0027Fork Handles\u0027 is a huge part of the British psyche - and this script was its birth. It\u0027s a \u0027holy grail\u0027 for collectors.  It is an absolutely iconic piece of our social history - not just television history. Barker, under his pen name, G Wiley, wrote \u0027Annie Finkhouse?\u0027 in red ink. Describing the scene, \u0027Wiley\u0027 wrote: An old ironmongers shop. A shop that sells everything. Garden equipment, ladies tights, builders supplies, mousetraps, everything. A long counter up and downstage. A door to the back of the shop up left. The back wall also has a counter. Lots of deep drawers and cupboards up high so that R.C. has to get a ladder to get some of the goods that R.B orders. (Please discuss).  It continues: R.C Yes Sir? R.B. Four candles? R.C. Four candles, yes sir. (He gets four candles from a drawer) There you are. R.B. No - fork handles R.C. Four candles. That\u0027s four candles. R.B. No. Fork handles. Handles for forks. R.C. Oh fork handles (he gets a garden fork handle from the top of the shelf). Anything else? The Four Candles sketch is arguably The Two Ronnies\u0027 most famous sketch and has gone down in comedy folklore.  It has led to a pub being named after the sketch in Barker\u0027s home town of Oxford, and at Barker\u0027s memorial service at Westminster Abbey in 2006, vergers carried four huge candles. Four candles were also lit at Corbett\u0027s funeral in 2016. Barker, who was famously very shy, would often donate items to local charity auctions and raffles during the Seventies and Eighties and it is presumed that this is how it came to be in public hands.  He would also famously use a pseudonym when writing sketches. For \u0027Annie Finkhouse?\u0027 he used his best-known pen name, Gerald Wiley. It is thought by using the pen name, comedy bosses would be able to make a more balanced decision on the sketch, rather than knowing it had been written by one-half of Britain\u0027s most famous comedy act. The script has been consigned to East Bristol Auctions\u0027 \u0027TV, Film \u0026amp Entertainment Memorabilia\u0027 sale on June 1.

Dakota Pitts walked into school with his dad\u0027s badge proudly around his neck as dozens of his father\u0027s colleagues lined up to support him. Moving footage shows Dakota making his way to the door of Sullivan Elementary School in Indiana while officers watch on. Afterwards, the cops gave him gifts and promised they would always have his back. Earlier this month, his dad Rob Pitts was tragically killed, aged 45, during a shootout with a suspect.   Les Ham, Terre Haute Police Department detective, told WTHI-TV : Dakota asked his mum if one of his dad\u0027s friends could take him to school, so she kind of reached out to Rob\u0027s friends and family.  Officer Pitts\u0027 sister, Kelli Jones, added: He will definitely know that his dad was a hero. Blood doesn\u0027t always make family, and I think the blue family just went above and beyond. The 45-year-old also leaves behind another son and daughter. He was killed during a shootout at an apartment complex where an armed murder suspect had barricaded himself.  The 45-year-old was hit after suspect Christopher Wolfe, 21, opened fire from the second floor of the building. He was rushed to hospital but later died of his injuries.

Kris Kacprzak and 15 other parachutists had made a scheduled jump from the small plane just minutes before it went down. His son Kacper stayed on board with pilot Neil \u0027Billy\u0027 Bowditch and both were killed in the tragedy in Co Offaly, Ireland. Mr Kacprzak, from Dublin, ran more than half a mile to the boggy site after witnessing the crash and desperately tried to dig out his son, the Irish Mirror reports.  A source close to the Irish Parachute Club told the Irish Daily Mail that the tragedy was unfolding by the time Mr Kacprzak had safely landed on the ground after jumping from the light aircraft. The plane went down on bog land in the Irish midlands on Sunday afternoon. The source said: Kris made the jump from the plane and by the time he landed, this terrible tragedy was unfolding. Kris dug with his bare hands during the recovery operation as we battled to save them.  Kris is something of a skydive enthusiast and Kacper loved his father. He loved planes and I have no doubt as he grew up would have loved to be up there with his dad. The source added: The pilot was a very well respected and experienced pilot from the UK. We have no idea what could have happened but it is very much tragedy for both families and for us as a wider community. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has been set up by Allaiouti Hassan, a friend of the Kacprzaks, to help both grieving families.

Footage of their bizarre find was posted to YouTube channel Explore With Us, and initially showed them walking around the rural camp. The derelict site in an unknown location shows vehicles left to rot and buildings crumbling to the ground. As the explorers continue their walk through the eerie site, they enter a tiny one-room building, before making their disturbing discovery. A metal shelving unit covering the back wall is pulled away, revealing a huge hole ripped in the wall behind - leading to the hidden room. The man filming the bizarre scene instructs another member of the team to investigate the contents of two tubs placed on shelving inside the room.  They then discover the tubs are filled with bullets before going on to film images of \u0027weird\u0027 cartoons and hardcore pornography stuck to the walls.

Other online viewers urged the explorers to call the police and report what they found. Paisley Campbell said: You should tell the police.

Criminologists have long known that many murderers share the same personality characteristics. But do those murderers also share the same star sign? David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolific or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out. Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April 20 and May 20 - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April 24 and February 18 stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decide if there really is a connection or if birthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. But if you have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18)  Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun? Aquarian serial killers include:  Gary Ridgway (Born February 18, 1949): One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer. Lee Boyd Malvo (Born February 18, 1985) David Birnie (Born February 16, 1951) Joel Rifkin (Born January 20, 1959) John Bodkin Adams (Born January 21, 1899) Luis Alfredo Garavito (Born January 25, 1957): Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolific serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly 150 boys and suspected of killing over 400.  Pisces (born February 19 to March 20)  Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign? Let’s take a look:  Aileen Wuornos (Born February 29, 1956): An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse. John Wayne Gacy (Born March 17, 1942): A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not. Dennis Radar (Born March 9, 1945): A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.” Stephen Port (Born February 22, 1975) Robert Napper (Born February 25, 1966) Colin Ireland (Born March 16, 1954) Peter Manuel (Born March 13, 1927): A Scottish serial killer. Doug Clark (Born March 10, 1948)  Aries (born March 21 to April 19)  They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of life, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:  Alexander Pichushkin (Born April 9, 1974): A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as 60 people. John Reginald Christie (Born April 8, 1899): An infamous serial killer who was active during the 1940s and 1950s. Herbert Mullin (Born April 18, 1947) Henri Desire Landru (Born April 12, 1869) Judy Buenoana (Born April 4, 1943)  Taurus (born April 20 to May 20) Although reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.  H. H. Holmes (Born May 16, 1861): Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything else. Michael Ryan (Born May 18, 1960): The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rifles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself. David Copeland (Born May 15, 1976): Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was. Karla Homolka (Born May 4, 1970): A Canadian serial killer who raped and murdered several children along with her husband. Albert Fish (Born May 19, 1870): One of the most well-known serial killers in the US, his nicknames included The Gray Man and Werewolf of Wysteria. A real-life Bogey Man, Fish was a child rapist and a cannibal. If this serial killer birthday matches yours, then you’re entitled to feel a little sick right now. Levi Bellfield (Born May 17, 1968): A child killer and rapist in the United Kingdom. Orville Lynn Majors (Born April 24 1961): Robert Black (Born April 21, 1947): A Scottish serial killer and paedophile. Steve Wright (Born April 24 1958): An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women. Martha Beck (Born, May 6, 1920)  Gemini (born May 21 to June 20)  The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something different. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.  David Berkowitz (Born June 1, 1953): Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose. Jeffrey Dahmer (Born May 21, 1960): The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims. Peter Sutcliffe (Born June 2, 1946): Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in 1970s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”. Richard Chase (Born May 23, 1950) Ted Kaczynski (Born May 22, 1942): Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist. Trevor Hardy (Born June 11, 1945)  Cancer (born June 21 to July 22)  Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.  Robert Maudsley (Born June 26, 1953): Responsible for the death of 4 people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.  Leo (born July 23 to August 22)  We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have?  Myra Hindley (Born July 23, 1942): One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK. Raymond Morris (Born August 13, 1929) John George Haigh (Born July 24, 1909) Anatoly Onoprienko (Born July 25, 1959): Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.  Virgo (born August 23 to September 22)  Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real life? Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers?  Ed Gein (Born August 26, 1906): A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin. Henry Lee Lucas (Born August 23, 1936): Convicted of around a dozen, confessed to many more, but is known to have lied about the majority of these. Peter Tobin (Born August 27, 1946): A convicted serial killer and sex offender who was active between 1991 and 2006. He was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh. Rodney Alcala (Born August 23, 1943): Was convicted of killing five people in California during the 1970s. Albert DeSalvo (Born September 3, 1931): Better known as the Boston Strangler, he is one of the better-known serial killers in the United States. Hs confession was disputed, and many believed he didn’t do it, but a DNA test performed in 2013 found that there was a 99.9% chance he did. DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.  Libra (born September 23 to October 22)  Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So, if there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.  Fred West (Born September 29, 1941): A man who murdered alongside his wife and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever. Beverley Allitt (Born October 4, 1968)  Scorpio (born October 23 to November 21)  Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.  Moses Sithole (Born November 17, 1964): A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive. Robert Pickton (Born October 24, 1949) Fritz Haarman (Born October 25, 1879)  Sagittarius (born November 22 to December 21)  Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world. But the same could be said for many killers who have done their bidding in far off corners of the globe. Their love of outdoors can make them strong and independent, while their distaste for clingy people could make them a little less compassionate and empathetic.  Dennis Nilsen (Born November 23, 1945): A British serial killer who targeted young gay men he knew no one would miss, before burning or flushing his victims. Ted Bundy (Born November 24, 1946): A charismatic serial killer who killed many young women and then defended himself in court. He was sentenced to death for his crimes. Rose West (Born November 29, 1953): The wife of Fred West, a woman who mirrored his sickening evil and helped him to kill young girls. Derrick Bird (Born November 27, 1957) Edward Kemper (Born December 18, 1948) Ray Fernandez (Born December 17, 1914)  Capricorn (born December 22 to January 19) "},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin drives truck over","story":"NewsVladimir Putin leads convoy of trucks over controversial 12-mile bridge as he officially opens link from Russia to annexed Crimean peninsulaThe Russian President drove the truck over the longest bridge in Europe during an official opening ceremony\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByToby Meyjes15:28, 15 MAY 2018Updated15:29, 15 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVladimir Putin led a convoy of trucks as he officially opened a controversial bridge connecting Russia with the annexed Crimean peninsula. The leader of the Kremlin has previously said that the 12-mile link is a dream of the tsars and Stalin but has only happened under his rule. The project, which has cost a staggering \u0026pound2.75 billion, has led to a wave of sanctions from the EU and US. But as he opened the controversial new structure today, which has been dubbed by some as Putin\u0027s Bridge, the Russian President remarked that he is sure people will \u0027love it\u0027. He added: I genuinely congratulate you on this historic holiday, historic because in different epochs, under the tsar-father, people dreamed about building this bridge. Finally thanks to your talent and work, this project, this wonder, has been completed  After the inspection today, the first regular traffic will cross the Crimea Bridge at 5.30 am tomorrow. The bridge has been widely condemned in both the Ukraine and by the European Union who today called it a \u0027violation of Ukraine\u0027s sovereignty\u0027, according to AFP. In Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: The illegal construction of the Kerch bridge is the latest evidencenof the Kremlin\u0027s disregard for international law. It is particularly cynical that its opening is happening on the eve of the latest anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people by the Stalin regime. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 after the toppling of pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev. The bridge spans a treacherous strait between the Black and Azov seas, and gives a key link to the Russian mainland.  A rail crossing is due to be completed late next year. Heavy vehicles have already been driven across the bridge in preparation for Putin\u0027s arrival, although approach highways are not yet complete.  However, there is still a concern in Russia over security. Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov has warned: “We are constantly expecting provocations from Ukraine but believe me, we are highly ready to resist any attacks.”  He vowed: “The professional readiness of the FSB, police, and Russian National Guards is high. “Nothing can be excluded with this kind of power in Kiev.  “They are fully dependent on Americans, they do not think about consequences for Ukraine. “At first they said that there won’t be any Crimean bridge, now they are talking some nonsense that they will block the movement on the bridge.” Ukrainian businessman Lenur Islyamov called for all cars using the bridge to be logged and sanctions imposed on each driver. “I do not know how to do it but I am convinced that if Ukraine cannot stop the movement on the bridge, at least all transport should be registered that goes from Russia to occupied Crimea. “Everyone must be located, name by name.

People will continue to fly-tip but there just won’t be any bins available for any rubbish at all.“I am asking for residents to come to the MOMTRA meeting on May 23 to give their feelings on the removal of their recycling centre.”The council has yet to respond to requests for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/30738828_2099954330021673_4382604420967003771_n-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people community gets behind rock hunt started by local child minder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIf you\u0026#8217re wandering through Invergowrie Village and come across a painted rock squirrelled away somewhere, you\u0026#8217ve unwittingly become part of a community-wide treasure hunt.Local childminder Audra Mckay first suggested the game in March after a friend told her of a similar activity in Broughty Ferry \u0026#8211  and the idea has since taken off.The premise is simple: find or buy a small rock or stone, paint it using acrylic paint, hide it somewhere in the village and wait for someone to find it \u0026#8211 with that person taking a photo of themselves with the rock before hiding it again somewhere else.While it\u0026#8217s hard to tell just how many painted rocks are now scattered around the village, dozens of photos of excited children and adults with the rocks they\u0026#8217ve found have been posted in the Invergowrie Village Facebook group.Audra said it was great that the idea had taken off."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people dundee music teacher miss budge didnt let being blind hold her back says former pupil","story":"\t\t\t\t\tShe may have been blind, but Dundee music teacher Miss Budge didn\u0026#8217t let that hold her back.A former student, Neil Sinclair, said he had fond memories of Miss Budge when she was his teacher at Balerno Primary school in Douglas, Dundee.\u0026#8220The amazing thing about her was she was blind, her disability never held her back,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I used to be her guide if we went to concerts, I.e at the Caird Hall.\u0026#8220I tried to contact her a few years back through Tayside House but due to the data protection act, unfortunately I could not.He said she was one of the nicest people he ever met.\u0026#8220I hope she is still alive and well and maybe if so through this could meet her again, as I was only 10 or 12 at the time around early 1970s,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220She coached me for the Leng medal.\u0026#8220I’m sure many will remember her if mentioned.He also remembered Hugh McMichael, his PE teacher at Craig High School, as a true gentleman.\u0026#8220It wouldn\u0026#8217t be right not to mention him,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220God bless, sadly he has passed away.\u0026#8220I had The pleasure of meeting up with him and his wife through work in the early 1980s,\u0026#8220He was hard as nails but installed great discipline, and through his values, had a great influence on me, having being orphaned at the age of five, had some great stories about his rugby days.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Professor-Robert-Steele-10-760x950-451x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee professor named fellow of academy of medical sciences","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProfessor Bob Steele, of the University of Dundee, has been elected to join the prestigious Fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences.The Academy of Medical Sciences is the independent body in the UK representing the diversity of medical science.

failed to supply records of accounts, meaning the company could be dissolved.A spokesman for Companies House said: “The Registrar is taking action under section 1000 (3) of the Companies Act to strike the company off the register as it appears not to be in business or operation.”The notice casts fresh doubt on whether Carnival Fifty Six will ever return to the city, despite the fact the festival

frontman Kyle Falconer.The Tele attempted to contact Brechin-based Allan Carnegie, the last remaining director of JEM Ltd, but received no response.A spokeswoman for JEM Concerts said following the cancellation in February: “After much consideration the decision has been taken to not return the festival to Camperdown Park for 2018.“We are taking a year off to explore the potential future direction of the show and hope to return in full effect in 2019.”In October Craig Blyth, Carnival Fifty Six founder and JEM Concerts director, quit due to a “fundamental difference of opinion about

Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Tuesday 15 May 2018 6:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like.
