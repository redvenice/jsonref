Sure enough, as soon as Harry put out his declaration, the statement dominated the news cycle.\u0027The team at Clarence House, which had spent months putting together Prince Charles\u0027s tour in the hopes that it would be covered significantly, was crushed.\u0027Extracts from the book, due to be published by HQ on August 11, have also covered claims the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brother\u0027s \u0027snobbish\u0027 attitude to his bride, and suggestions the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press.Harry confirmed he was dating US actress Meghan Markle in the November 2016 statement and lashed out at the \u0027wave of abuse and harassment\u0027 she has faced from the media.In a lengthy and strongly-worded statement, Harry\u0027s Communications Secretary Jason Knauf outlined the difficulties Miss Markle had experienced since news of their relationship broke.Mr Knauf said \u0027The past week has seen a line crossed.

Figures collected from 15 schools and ten nurseries showed that although 27 children or teachers went to lessons while infectious, only an additional 18 people became infected.A Government spokesman said: ‘We have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October. Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can reopen safely.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"A marriage meltdown Whats really like family unravel eyes","story":"Share this article This time, we didn’t take each other for granted. We had date nights once a month. We spoke openly about Tim’s affair and I thought we’d put it behind us.But within a year, he had started coming home late again. Last June, he said he needed to stay overnight on a plastering job nearby, and I asked if it was necessary.He told me not to be paranoid, but the distrust and distance grew. Last August, writing Tim’s anniversary card felt weird. Over dinner a couple of days later he said, seemingly out of nowhere, that if I fell out of love with him I should leave.Somewhere in my subconscious I admitted I was unhappy, but couldn’t bring myself to say so. It wasn’t until two days later that he finally admitted he didn’t love me any more. He agreed to move in with a friend.I couldn’t eat or sleep for days, telling our daughter Daddy had moved out because he didn’t love Mummy any more. I put off filing for orce, realising it would be expensive.But last December, I received a Facebook message from a stranger saying I should know that Tim had resumed his affair that summer. On confronting him he admitted it and said sorry.He said the affair was over this time, and I didn’t push for specifics. He has to live with the guilt, not me. I felt furious but conflicted. At first, I wanted to not only file for orce, but fight Tim in court for more than 50 per cent of the house — which I’ve been told, given the circumstances, I could be entitled to.But he was also the father of my daughter. Arguing about money would lead to bigger bills and, more importantly, more rows that would upset our little girl.I filed on the grounds of adultery because my solicitor said proving irreconcilable differences would be harder.Tim agreed — he didn’t have a choice. His solicitor’s fees have come to £900 so far. Perhaps unfairly, the person filing for orce has to foot the bigger bill.Days after initiating proceedings the country went into lockdown and Tim, no longer able to live with his friend, came to live with us — something I agreed to for our daughter’s sake.She knows her daddy doesn’t have anywhere else to stay. He’s at the other end of the house in the spare room, with his own bathroom. We take it in turns to cook meals.There are still heated moments, not least as our legal fees rise, but deciding to orce has taken away some of the tension.I think we’re both too shattered to be angry any more. Screaming and shouting would make me ill and upset our daughter. She knows that when our house goes on the market — next month, hopefully — she’s moving with me to her new home, although Tim and I have agreed to split custody.Some days I can forgive him for his affair. Other days I struggle. But I’ll always care for him as my daughter’s father, and as someone I’ve shared nearly 12 largely happy years with.I hope that our decree absolute, expected this autumn, brings us both a fresh start. And if nothing else, the heartache and expense of orce has made me sure of this much: I’ll never marry again.Tim gave Natasha his blessing to write about their marriage, but declined to comment.Interview by ANTONIA HOYLE"},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon says wanted cry pictures pubgoers no social distancing","story":"Share this articlePub at centre of coronavirus outbreak now has 27 confirmed cases - doubling in 24 hours - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Workers resentful colleagues working home HR staff say","story":"Share this article Research by BrightHR, a company which provides HR support to small and medium businesses, found that there is an \u0027us and them\u0027 ision emerging in companies which have some staff members at home and some in the office. BrightHR CEO Alan Price said most small business were not yet ordering all their staff to return to the office due to social distancing rules and childcare concerns, although he said there could be a \u0027watershed\u0027 moment in September when children go back to school. New government guidance which came into effect on August 1 meant that employers can now ask staff to return to the office under the condition that social distancing rules must be maintained. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f0ab3a92e4eed4e1562042acd5601e76c0e32a/0_294_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55475f9685e2713e14a853fe88c2e2a","title":"10 summer wellness ideas for you and your family","story":"With the school holidays here and lockdown measures easing up around the country, now is the time to stretch those legs and get some exercise while remaining safe and within social distancing guidelinesThere’s nothing like a global pandemic to make us re-evaluate what’s really important in life and for many of us, it’s our health. Tight restrictions on where we’ve been able to go and what we’ve been able to do have boosted the sales of fitness equipment as we’ve looked for ways to stay in shape, while staying safe.For many, this unprecedented situation has strained both our physical and mental wellbeing, but with lockdown measures easing and warmer weeks ahead, now is the time to renew good intentions and get more physically active.“Lockdown has knocked our health balance,” says Claire Davis, a fitness coach at wellness retreat 38 Degrees North. “We’ve eaten and drunk too much, exercised less than normal and succumbed to bad habits, increasing our stress levels. But summer is the ideal time to make healthy changes.”So whether your aim is to lose the odd lockdown pound, feel fitter or just stay strong enough to weather life’s next big storm, this is the perfect time to make the changes you’ve been daydreaming about.1. Borrow a dogSpoiler alert: walking is perhaps the best exercise there is as it’s low impact, can be done anywhere and almost anyone of any fitness level can get involved, for free.Just 15 minutes of moderate walking can see you cover about a mile’s worth of ground, so it’s easily one of the best ways to get out and get moving. Getting kids excited about going for a walk can be challenging, so why not lure them with the temptation of a furry friend for company? Borrow a neighbour’s dog to take to the local park or check out dog-lending websites such as borrowmydoggy to find a pooch in your area that may need its legs stretching.2. Pick local produceBecause of lockdown, the pick-your-own season has had a bit of a slow start, but many farms have now applied social distancing measures and reopened for business. A morning or afternoon picking your own fruit and veg is not only wholesome family fun (whisper it: exercise), but it also supports local businesses, and ticks the environmentally friendly box as it means fresh groceries without all of the unnecessary shrink-wrap. A quick Google should help locate your local farms (or try pickyourownfarms.org.uk) and remember to call to check opening times and crop availability ahead of your visit.3. Go for a dipSummer is the perfect time for outdoor swimming, whether that’s at your local lido (call and check that they’ve reopened) or somewhere a little more wild. There’s something extremely invigorating about braving the elements and swimming outdoors, and the UK is studded with rivers, lakes, ponds and beaches that are clean and safe to swim in.Wild swimming is loaded with health benefits, from lowering stress hormones to improving circulation and reducing inflammation, plus a 30-minute session in cold water can burn almost 400 calories. Visit wildswimming for locations close to you.4. Raise your voicePeople underestimate the fitness potential of a good old sing-song, but belting out a few tunes can burn calories, strengthen the diaphragm and pump more oxygen around the body than many other forms of aerobic exercise. It’s also brilliant for mental health – reducing stress, boosting self-confidence and releasing endorphins.Most local choirs remain on hold due to Covid-19 but many are holding virtual sing-alongs (check out singforfun).5. Hit the dance floorIt might be a while before nightclubs reopen, but dancing is a brilliant form of exercise and can be done right this second. Not only is dance a brilliant all-over aerobic workout, there is also a unique sense of freedom and empowerment that comes from moving your body to music, perfect for pepping yourself up post-lockdown.Dance instructor Illana Gambrill was so overwhelmed by people desperate to get back to Dancebox – her Essex-based classes – that she’s created a weekly online programme that is easy to sign up to, simple to follow and a bona fide saviour for mind, body and soul.6. Eat alfrescoWeather permitting, there is nothing more satisfying than sharing a meal with friends and family outdoors – the feelgood factor itself does much to boost our wellbeing. It is also thought to be of great benefit to children as outdoor eating – such as picnics and barbecues – often goes hand-in-hand with playdates and family bonding time. Fire up the coals or get a disposable barbecue to grill fish or lean cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or pork fillets, which are a healthier substitute for fatty burgers and sausages.Experiment with different marinades and simple side salads, invite some friends and don’t forget your brolly for the quintessential British experience. Fingers crossed you won’t need it.7. Learn to hulaHula hooping might conjure up visions of 1980s lycra-clad fitness types, or seem more like vintage child’s play, but it can actually burn as much fat as treadmill exercises, and other benefits include toning muscles and strengthening your heart.Advocates reckon that 10 minutes of hula-ing a day will see results and the plastic hoop should only set you back a couple of quid from a general store (although if you’re feeling fancy, a weighted one can be purchased for less than the cost of your average round at the pub). With minimal kit required and plenty of tutorials available online, this is an amazing way to start getting active again after the long lockdown break.8. Go geocachingImagine that you could be a part of the world’s biggest treasure hunt the moment you step out your door. Geocaching is exactly that. This free outdoor activity is suitable for all ages and uses the GPS on your smartphone to allow you to hide and seek secret containers at specific locations, marked by coordinates all over the world.Getting you out and about, turning you into real-life Lara Crofts – this is a brilliantly fun activity for the whole family. And with more than 3m caches to find, there’s bound to be something to sniff out near you. Register for a free basic membership at geocaching.9. Get out in the gardenThere is increasing evidence that gardening provides substantial health benefits – just interacting with flora lowers our cortisol, improving mood and mental health. You can also burn about 330 calories doing one hour of light gardening, plus when you’re outdoors your body makes vitamin D, which strengthens bones, although you should still apply sunscreen.If you don’t have a garden, search online for a local community gardening initiative failing that, plant some salad leaves in indoor pots. Growing your own food helps children develop a lasting habit of eating fresh vegetables and might make them more likely to try new (green) things.10. Walk and workFor many, lockdown has forced us to re-evaluate the way we work, revealing our astounding ability to multitask. So post lockdown, consider the ways in which you could make your regular working day that bit more active.Need to schedule a 30-minute meeting? Do what Steve Jobs was fond of and have a walking meeting instead. Or if somebody wants to meet up to talk business over coffee, suggest making it a takeaway and having a stroll. You can also extend these multitasking habits outside of work hours with a spot of “temptation bundling” – pairing something you love with an activity you’re trying to do more of. Make sitting in a squat while binge-watching box-sets the new normal.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

We must be prepared for the multi-purpose, multi-layered revolution, in which political ideologies and mantras will, and must, collide.The word abolition, most commonly understood to describe efforts that sought a legal end to chattel slavery, has a complex history. Many white advocates who deployed the term in the height of the abolitionist movements of the 18th and 19th century were not actually interested in the material emancipation of black life. Aphra Behn’s 1688 novel Oroonoko, for example, intended to awaken the English middle-class to the horrors of slavery, while employing a number of deeply racist and dehumanising tropes to do so.But abolition as we know it now, developed through the black feminist tradition, owes everything to imaginative potential. It is a belief in emancipatory forms of social organisation and an end to all forms of violence, expropriation and exploitation. As prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore writes, abolition is about “presence, not absence” prison abolition, as one example, is about “abolishing the conditions under which prison became the solution to problems.” Prison abolitionists argue that carceral systems like prison, policing and detention are dangerous and wholly inadequate responses to crime that merely perpetuate the harm they claim to end. They are critical of ways of thinking that root wrongdoing in the inidual, arguing instead that the social causes of crime require social solutions, beginning with an improvement of the conditions of life for all - free education, housing provision, healthcare and investing in community self-governance. Abolitionists believe that racist systems of police and prison do not keep us safe and that they should not simply be reformed in an attempt to “improve” them, but abolished altogether.The desire to abolish police and prisons can be traced in grassroots black feminist traditions across the world. In the 1970s and 80s in the UK, organisations such as the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD) and the Brixton Black Women’s Group, home to coalitions between black women and women of colour, campaigned against flagrant police violence and abuses of stop and search powers. Nicknamed “SUS laws”, these clauses enabled police officers to justify arrest solely on the basis of suspected intent to commit a crime. It is near impossible to ignore the legacy of such a law in the disproportionate searching, brutality and imprisonment of black people in the UK. In Heart of the Race, Black Women’s Lives in Britain, authors Beverly Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe write: “Even when our children were at school, we could expect the police to be called into the playground to break up fights… it was as a result of these experiences of racist police force that black women began to organise against specific incidents of abuse and against legislation.”The actions of these feminist groups were prototypes for networks of mutual aid, like those that have emerged since the onset of the pandemic they modelled what community power that sought to render the police irrelevant could look like. These women knew, as Stuart Hall writes, that “race is the modality through which class is lived” and their experiences as members of the working class were constituted and compounded by the systemic racism that locked them out of state protection and limited their access to resources.The killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police propelled abolition into the mainstream. Those of us who remember the eruption of protests, demonstrations, and organising around Black Lives Matter that took place in the UK in 2015, and who know the names of Joy Gardener, Cynthia Jarrett, Rashan Charles, Christopher Alder and so many more victims of racist police violence, feel the need to challenge the reductive view that this is only a US problem. SoRevolution is not a one-time event, a programme convened by Che Gossett, Sarah Shin and myself in collaboration with Arika and hosted by Silver Press, will attempt to understand and amplify abolitionist demands in this moment by bringing artists, organisers and academics together, and provide a space for reflection and political animus. Our event The Master’s Tools Can Never Dismantle the Master’s House: Abolitionist Feminist Futures, to be chaired by academic and organiser Akwugo Emejulu and featuring academic Gail Lewis, critic Hortense Spillers, writer Zoe Samudzi and trans activist Miss Major, will explore abolitionist futures. In her work analysing black women’s presence and absence in public discourse, Lewis calls to Sarah Reed, a black woman with complex mental health issues who died in Holloway Prison in 2015 after being failed by mental health professionals and prison staff. “But if she is present, how is she here?  Only as: ‘brutalised black woman’...  Only as: a ‘mentally unwell black woman’?” Understanding Lorde’s idea that the “master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house” means recognising that the system that locked Reed away will never set others like her free. This is the first step in dismantling ideas that a broken system can be “fixed” via law, police and prison reform.“The intimate realm is an extension of the social world… so to create other networks of love and affiliation is to be involved in the work of challenging and remaking the terms of sociality” writes Saidiya Hartman, a participant of the second panel, Poetry is not a Luxury: The Poetics of Abolition. In 1985, Lorde wrote, “Poetry coins the language to express and charter this revolutionary awareness and demand, the implementation of that freedom.” If poetics is the study of the creation, production and art of making meaning, then we must understand its role in revolution. Hartman’s work directs the reader’s eye to the anarchic posture of black life and community, to the power of revolution lived at the register of the everyday. Her fellow panelist Christina Sharpe continues this tradition in her book In The Wake, in which she refuses to treat images as static archival memorabilia. She analyses black persistence and survival in the face of the processes that render black people outside subjects.What does abolition mean in the age of the internet? Using coding, hacking and other means of online sabotage to make it harder for the police to target vulnerable people. “Glitch is a necessary erratum, a site of positive departure,” writes Legacy Russell, author of Glitch Feminism and chair of the panel System Errors: Abolitionist Technologies and Aesthetics. Through cyberfeminism, we can make ourselves unknowable in order to outsmart the logics of surveillance capital. Currently, law enforcement is using all manner of digital practice including photography and Instagram posts to track down and charge protesters. Technology must be harnessed to both liberate and obscure blackness to strip the digital image of its power. British artist and panellist Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley does this in their work, building a video game-like space online that visitors must navigate to evade the threats that black trans people face everyday. This panel will explore how the current matrix of violent governance takes place through physical and digital forms of dispossession and must be fought on both grounds.The last panel in this programme, Happy Birthday, Marsha! – held on the birthday of black trans campaigner Marsha P Johnson – centres on care. Abolitionist modes of thinking encourage us to discover new forms of intimacy, speculation and kinship by encouraging community building with those outside our immediate family. That is how we keep each other safe when the state and racist institutions fail us. Despite its complexity, at its most basic, abolition is about enacting the future we want now and refusing to let anyone tell us it is impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6bec7217d46da8ba1ed83f8d9c95970919c1c1c/495_198_5533_3324/master/5533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14efa4e47a6ada9e977935d676172eeb","title":"dw sports administration jobs coronavirus lockdown","story":"Retailer and gym operator collapses and travel agent chain to make redundanciesAlmost 2,600 staff in the beleaguered retail and leisure industries face redundancy after the fitness and gymwear firm DW Sports collapsed and the tour operator Hays Travel announced job cuts, blaming the UK government’s policy on travel to Spain.As the gloom around the two sectors deepened, DW Sports fell into administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk.The group, founded by the former Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, operates 73 gyms and 75 shops across the UK. It said its retail website would cease trading immediately, weeks after it announced plans to shut 25 of its stores as the coronavirus lockdown wiped out its income.Its remaining 50 shops will continue to trade for the time being but will begin closing-down sales from Monday.“As a consequence of Covid-19, we found ourselves in a position where we were mandated by government to close down both our retail store portfolio and our gym chain in its entirety for a protracted period, leaving us with a high fixed-cost base and zero income,” said the DW Sports group chief executive, Martin Long.“Like many other retail businesses, the consequences of this extremely challenging operating market have created inevitable profitability issues for DW Sports.”The company said that Fitness First, which it also owns and has 43 clubs across the UK, is a separate business and is unaffected.DW Sports said it intended to support employees, customers and gym members “as far as possible while efforts are made to secure a purchaser for some or all of the DW Sports portfolio”.Long said: “Having exhausted all other available options for the business, we firmly believe that this process can be a platform to restructure the business and preserve many of our gyms for our members, and also protect the maximum number of jobs possible for our team members.” The company said it was “inevitable” that some gyms would close. “The decision to appoint administrators has not been taken lightly but will give us the best chance to protect viable parts of the business, return them to profitability and secure as many jobs as possible,” Long said. “It is a difficult model for any business to manage through without long-term damage, and with the limited support which we have been able to gain.”Alongside retail, tourism has been among the worst-affected sectors because of strict curbs on international travel, with Tui Travel announcing the closure of 166 shops last week.The family-owned tour operator Hays Travel announced almost 900 redundancies on Monday, blaming government-imposed restrictions on travel to Spain.The owners, John and Irene Hays, said the decision to impose a blanket ban, rather than take the more “sophisticated” approach of curbing holidays to affected regions, had led to the cancellation of “hundreds of thousands” of holidays.“The government have used a very blunt instrument and banned all travel to Spain full stop, whereas in the south of Spain and in the Balearic islands and Canaries, rates of infection are really low, in fact, lower than the British average,” John Hays said.He said the policy was a “crude bludgeon” compared with the more targeted approach taken by Germany, which has barred travel to affected regions.Hays Travel rescued the jobs of 2,500 Thomas Cook staff last year when the tour operator collapsed and had been optimistic about avoiding pandemic-related cuts.However, after a board meeting on Friday, Hays Travel concluded that the impact of the fresh travel restrictions meant they could no longer avoid job losses, the first significant redundancies in the company’s 40-year history.The Sunderland-based business said the cuts would affect 344 people training as travel consultants and a further 534 who work in the company’s foreign exchange business.The Hays said changes to the furlough scheme that came into force on Monday, under which the state hands back responsibility for paying national insurance and pension contributions to employers, were also a factor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4742149203ff8bcc8d465c415a27c7602c723d6/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d646eac7a839e27d05a09b2ece40ace7","title":"hsbc is biggest loser in never ending us china global power play","story":"Europe’s biggest bank is being buffeted by the pandemic and crossfire between Beijing and Washington In most respects HSBC is no different from any other bank. Plunging activity means lending is down, more money is being put aside to cover losses and profits are being squeezed.There is, though, one crucial difference between Europe’s biggest bank and its rivals: HSBC makes more than half its profits from Hong Kong – and that makes life pretty uncomfortable right now. The reason the bank’s share price is trading at levels last seen before the handover of the former British colony to China in 1997 is partly due to the state of the global economy but also has a lot to do with global politics.Put simply, HSBC is caught in the middle of an intensifying cold war between Washington and Beijing and has managed to upset both parties.Back in 2018, the bank provided documents to the US authorities that led to the arrest in Canada of the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei. That infuriated Beijing, which does not appear to have been placated by the HSBC’s supine decision to provide a public show of support for China’s new security crackdown law in Hong Kong. The Americans, though, are hopping mad and are making all sorts of minatory noises. Washington could make life extremely difficult for HSBC in the US.Boris Johnson can probably understand how Noel Quinn, HSBC’s chief executive, feels. Just like the bank, Britain made a strategic decision when David Cameron and George Osborne were running the show that it made sense to do business with a fast-growing economic superpower. The assumption – shared by HSBC and the UK government – was that it was possible to be on good terms with both the US and China, and it was not a question of one or the other.That all seems a long time ago. The struggle between the US and China might have begun as a fight over tariffs, exports and trade regimes but has since expanded to include human rights, national security and the merits of different models of capitalism.There is no hint that the contest will end even if Joe Biden beats Donald Trump in the November presidential election, which is bad news for the global economy, bad news for the UK and bad news for HSBC.Not so long ago many companies had an aversion to their staff working from home. Managers felt they needed to keep tabs on what workers were doing. Otherwise there would be skiving on an industrial scale, which would affect the bottom line.It has taken a global pandemic to change the corporate mindset. Companies have found, perhaps to their surprise, that those WFH have actually been sitting at their computer rather than sagging off to the park, the shops or the golf course. Many of them are wondering why they have been paying so much for office space when modern technology means teams can keep in touch via Zoom calls.These days it is the government, rather than companies, that is pressing for people to return to their desks and it is not hard to see why. Business districts are like ghost towns, and that has a significant knock-on effect on a range of enterprises: sandwich bars, pubs, shops and minicab firms among them.From the start of the month, ministers made it possible for firms to order their employees back to the office provided it was safe to do so. Yet, against the backdrop of local restrictions being imposed and with the government itself stoking fears about a second wave of Covid-19, companies are inevitably going to err on the side of caution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8ca0a75d8adb9b4c535eb91fbb3551c97fb85c6/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a489cadd3d6fe7602128038963af45","title":"up to 45000 new homes to be green lit ahead of planning shake up","story":"Treasury to allocate £900m to over 300 ‘shovel ready’ schemes and infrastructure projectsProjects to build up to 45,000 new homes are to get the green light as part of the latest round of investment from Boris Johnson’s promised “New Deal” ahead of a radical planning shake-up expected this week.The Treasury is to allocate £900m from funds announced in Rishi Sunak’s budget to more than 300 so-called “shovel ready” schemes, which include the homes, new commercial space and infrastructure projects such as a high-speed rail station in Kent.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the investment would be “laying the foundations for a green economic recovery”.Jenrick and the prime minister have promised major changes to planning laws in England, to be formally announced in the coming days, under which new homes and hospitals could be granted automatic planning permission to speed up building.Under the plans, local councils will be asked to designate land either as “growth”, “renewal” or “protection”. New developments will be granted automatic permission on “growth” land and “renewal” areas will see developments given “permission in principle” subject to some checks. Only areas given the “protection” status, including the greenbelt, will not have automatic building rights.The forthcoming reforms have led to warnings from housing charities about the potential risk of low-quality homes.The government has also confirmed a £360m investment in Mayoral Combined Authority areas such as Greater Manchester and the West Midlands to build 26,000 more homes while protecting greenfield sites, with a further £8m earmarked to speed up the delivery of these new homes on brownfield sites.The business and energy department also detailed its plans to fund up to two-thirds of the costs of green home improvements for more than 600,000 homes.The investment is part of the £5bn New Deal spending announced in June, part of the £600bn-plus Sunak allocated in his March budget for capital projects over the next five years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7e4fc733dfffc90fcde3b6b182cf47dd6cafcbe/38_0_5024_3015/master/5024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e47ad5d3ac5dfa578b9f4a9ca0123db","title":"we dont feel pressure to go back england firms in no hurry to resume office life coronavirus","story":"Companies can decide if it is safe for staff to return after working from home in coronavirus crisisFrom this week, companies in England can decide whether it is safe for employees to go back to the office after the coronavirus lockdown prompted more people to work from home. However, few businesses appear to be preparing for a mass return to desks, meeting rooms and cafeterias on Monday. Here are the views of some firms on the notion of resuming office life.“We’ve managed remote working very well so far,” says Alan Spurgeon, 48, who is the chief executive of Hedgehog Digital, which helps companies build a more effective presence on the web. “We’ve been really really productive throughout that period, so we haven’t felt that it’s hindered us. Because of this, we don’t feel a pressure to go back in.”Spurgeon, who employs seven people at Hedgehog’s office in Hayle, Cornwall, says there is no financial pressure at the moment for them to return to the workplace. “We’re a small team and don’t want to put anyone at risk of infection.“As Cornwall has become one of the few locations people can take a summer holiday in, we are also aware that with a rise in tourists comes a possible increase in Covid-19 infection.”There are concerns, however, that not returning to the office may have an impact on people’s mental health. “It’s been nearly six months in an isolated work environment and it’s important to be aware that some of the team may be alone at home when working.“We’re trying to communicate more than usual but it can be a lonely environment. Overall, the team is really positive about not going back into the office. I’ve been asking them all regularly and while I don’t know yet if it’s a bit of a novelty, the feedback so far is positive.”The office used by Carers Centre, a Leicester-based charity that provides support to family carers, is unsuitable for work during a pandemic. “There is too much open space in our current premises and putting up barriers would cause problems for some staff members who are mobility restricted,” says Charles Huddleston, a co-manager at the centre.“We’ve found a new office on the ground floor with partitioned rooms and we’re hoping to move in September but lockdown has made the process move at a snail’s pace.”Huddleston, 62, says remote working began early on in March at the charity, which has about nine people working in the office with two volunteers at any given time. “We moved to working from home on 18 March before lockdown was announced,” he says. “This was partly because of the vulnerable nature of some of the people we work with and care for. We made sure every member of staff had a computer they could use from home.”Working remotely, however, means there can be a lack of human contact for some. “All the people who work for us are carers and as iniduals might become socially isolated. As an organisation, we’re about people and for people who are socially isolated under normal circumstances, lockdown emphasises that loneliness. Once everything is ready and set up to maximise everyone’s safety, we’ll go back. Not before.”“We’ve given up our office in London,” says Chris Brown, who works as a “profit for purpose” property developer and employs 35 people. “We are keeping our offices in Nottingham and Manchester but in London we weren’t all coming together very often, preferring to work in the cafe downstairs.”Conversations about whether an office was needed or not began last year but nothing was decided until the pandemic. “We started to question why we were paying rent for a space that we weren’t using,” the 60-year-old says. “You don’t need a box with desks to invite people for a meeting. In fact, that’s the last place you’d want to do it.”It has been almost two weeks since Brown and his team moved out of their London office. “We’re not concerned about losing the social side of things. We’re in discussion with the cafe owner about reserving our favourite table on a Friday when they reopen, so we’ll recreate our office space that way.”What the pandemic has made clear for Jon Sweet, the chief executive of the London-based Lysis Group, is that an office is not needed to be able to work. “We’ve transitioned seamlessly,” says the 54-year-old, who runs a financial consultancy with 150 employees.“For me as CEO, the biggest question is risk management,” he says. “People are our biggest asset and people who are unwell are not much good to us. The key is do I want the whole team in the same place at the same time? The answer is no.”Sweet is considering having several smaller satellite offices rather than only one. “We’re thinking of two or three around the M25 and one in central London. We’re right by Bank station and we need some office space there because of customers. But it’s expensive real estate.”However, there have been some employees who have struggled at home. “We’ve found that some younger employees are finding it difficult to keep up productivity. There are also others with small children, and those who are extroverts, who are feeling the same, so they might be brought back earlier.“We’re not planning to ditch the office altogether but we’re not going to force people to be in most of the time – maybe once a month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/810cf6d4688f36ab4856ea61b41b4f76b7168470/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47108dce023f3c278606fb3f36c96dd9","title":"isolating over 50s idea covid 19","story":"The latest government thinking is aimed at pitting generations against each other, to distract from its Covid-19 policy failures“Nuclear option” is a sloppy phrase to use about viral transmission – so it’s unsurprising to discover that the option is, itself, quite sloppy. As reported in the Sunday Times, the government has discussed asking people over 50 to stay at home, as part of a suite of measures to prevent another full lockdown.Don’t panic: it wouldn’t be all over-50s, just the ones with as yet unnamed co-morbidities. Fitness fanatics in their 50s are tearing across social media, complaining that they’re already far healthier than their binge-drinking thirtysomething neighbours. You can expect that outrage to run and run (they make great triathletes, the over-50s), long after the actual scheme has been abandoned. And the idea is vanishingly unlikely to make the transition from gossip to fact.For a start, it shows a poor understanding of family composition: many people in their 50s will still have teenagers and young adults living at home. Their children, unless the plan is that they also shield, should be going back to school or university, not to mention restarting the economy with their social lives – which would completely negate the extra protection afforded their parents by remaining at home. Before the crisis, one in five people aged between 50 and 64 was a carer for an elderly relative that proportion has surely risen, now that even the elderly who were not previously housebound are considered too high risk to go out.It is puzzling who, in this nuclear plan, would be left to shop and care for both elderly and middle-aged people. I dread to think how large the word “Ocado” appears in the wordcloud of these blue-sky meetings.Second, there has been apparently no consideration of the knock-on economic effect: no talk of a tailored furlough scheme, no indication of who will be able to afford to “eat out to help out”, once all the boomers are out of the picture.Finally, the potential impact is huge: already, 2.2 million people have spent spring and the start of summer “shielding” in enforced isolation, at huge cost to their happiness (“wellbeing” is the more commonly deployed word, sounding more serious-minded I absolutely insist, however, that “happiness” be returned to the discourse). It is impossible to estimate how many more would be affected by the over-50 quarantine since its details are so flaky, but we can feel pretty safe with “a lot”.In truth I doubt this was ever a real idea, and the dead cat theory is already pretty widespread – people speculating that the Conservative party released this extreme talking point in order to distract our attention from other, more shaming events, such as the accusations of rape and sexual assault against one of its MPs. However, “dead cat” is becoming an over-generalised and insufficient concept, when it comes to analysing the actions of a government whose incompetence is often indistinguishable from deliberate destructiveness, whose ignorance is impossible to distinguish from untruth.It’s not enough to say, “this is a distraction”, and simply too easy to think of the proliferation of unfortunate headlines they may want to distract us from. When the Conservatives drop these bombs into the public conversation, it is with a purpose: the stupider the idea, on paper, the more likely it is that its discursive effect has been quite carefully planned. To return to the dead cat, some of this feline carrion is just there to smell bad and some of it is carrying cholera, and it might benefit us to make the distinction.There was already an undercurrent, not so much of generations pitted against one another, but certainly of having to make sacrifices for one another, in the fight against coronavirus. Its mortality rate is famously low in the young, and yet that is the generation that feels the restrictions most keenly – in the interruption to their lives, their education, their employment prospects. People generally coped with the cruelty of this imbalance for the simple reason that nobody operates only within their own generation it is in the nature of human intimacy that a good portion of the people we care about are a lot older or younger than us.Mostly, we’ve kept the peace by avoiding absolute positions and rarely spelling out the trade-offs or where they might lead. Very few people, except on the far right, are stridently asking how much of a young life it is reasonable to put on hold we tentatively trust to the future, to vaccines, luck and good government, and shelve issues about whose life comes first. That’s quite a fragile peace, and when it breaks down – when the media starts blaming the young, for protests, raves, going to the beach, and when we start to perceive selfishness in other generations as the driver of our own hardship – behaviour and decisions based on altruism become less and less likely.It’s hard to see how the large-scale restraint that we may well need again can be summoned up, to a drumbeat of mutual resentment. Yet it’s much easier to be a failing government in those conditions, when everybody’s indignation is directed in these amorphous, demographic directions. And it’s hard to create a really full-blooded war between generations if middle-aged people remain neutral in it, worrying about both young and old.The over-50s are being wound up deliberately, in other words. The discord is strategic, and they shouldn’t rise to it. Though that’s easy for me to say. I’m only 46."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb91a4cb34bb593a8101154a0d94f2f384d22d1c/185_121_3002_1801/master/3002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d9d40ca2296db2190202398295a11d","title":"the guardian view on belarus slippers and democracy","story":"A remarkable election campaign by the wife of a jailed blogger is causing major problems for ‘Europe’s last dictator’It takes unusual courage to take on Alexander Lukashenko in an election. In 2010, for example, when the president of Belarus was seeking a fourth term of office, a number of his opponents were arrested and charged with organising mass disorder on polling day. But if your spouse has been jailed and your family threatened, the stakes of standing against the man often described as “Europe’s last dictator” must seem unbearably high.This is the challenge that 37-year-old Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has accepted, ahead of Belarus’s latest exercise in pseudo-democracy this Sunday. With no previous political experience, Ms Tikhanovskaya took over the presidential candidacy of her husband, Sergei, a well-known blogger, in May, after he was ruled out of the race and imprisoned on trumped-up charges. So far, she is knocking it out of the park.After ensuring the safety of her children by sending them abroad, Ms Tikhanovskaya has turned the election into the biggest challenge to Mr Lukashenko’s autocracy since he took power in 1994. She has one main policy: the holding of proper, free and fair elections within six months. Backed by the supporters of two other barred candidates, she has held rallies that have been among the largest in Belarus since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her movement has adopted a 1970s freedom song taken from the Polish Solidarity movement. It also has a symbol – a slipper – which stands for the need to stamp out corruption.For Mr Lukashenko, this is a troubling turn of events. The chances of Ms Tikhanovskaya emerging victorious from Sunday’s stage-managed poll are more or less zero but the massed ranks of singing demonstrators in Minsk, waving mobile phone flashlights, conjure up memories of Ukraine’s anti-corruption Maidan revolution. The rattled president has long pledged that nothing of that kind will ever occur on his watch, but has begun to hint at unspecified constitutional reform.The new vulnerability of a notoriously insular and authoritarian regime has multiple causes. Mr Lukashenko has scandalised many of his citizens by refusing to impose a lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic, advising instead that drinking vodka and going to the sauna would ward off the disease. The Belarusian economy has stagnated for a decade, corroding the government’s reputation among blue-collar workers and in the provinces. Unprecedented domestic turbulence comes as the president’s relations with Moscow have deteriorated after a refusal to form a unified state with Russia. Last week, Mr Lukashenko claimed Russian mercenaries were being sent to Belarus to subvert Sunday’s election.As a charged campaign reaches its climax, Mr Lukashenko is responding in time-honoured fashion. Anti-riot troops have been told they must not permit street protests. State television has pointedly broadcast images of water cannon and troops practising counter-demonstration measures. But Mr Lukashenko may calculate that, with relations with Vladimir Putin in the deep freeze, he cannot afford to also outrage western opinion by authorising a ferocious crackdown on the growing protest movement.For the first time in 26 years, Mr Lukashenko does not appear to be fully in control of events in his fiefdom. To that extent, whatever Sunday’s outcome, Ms Tikhanovskaya has already won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3233f2f03e691b4892c4a44aaf8e364c56251789/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffbb5412371123a441dc6a1e11f95045","title":"the guardian view on local leadership in the pandemic power down","story":"Manchester’s declaration of a major incident is a message to both local people and ministersAlmost 1,200km ide the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, from the town of Thurso in northern Scotland. The UK is the third most populous country in Europe (after Germany and France). So it is not remotely surprising that while regional variations in Covid-19 infection rates were less pronounced than in some countries, the pandemic has been experienced differently depending on where you live. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all feature in the top eight European countries for excess deaths. But England, in first place, has fared far worse than Northern Ireland, in eighth.But if it is not surprising that ministers defaulted to a secretive, top-down approach at the first sign of trouble, the failure to build effective partnerships with leaders in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and across England still counts among the government’s biggest mistakes. The breach with Scotland that opened when the prime minister began to chart a route out of lockdown in May shows no sign of being mended. Meanwhile frustration across England is growing, as council leaders and directors of public health watch their fears about the pitfalls of a centralised tracking and tracing system coming true.Leicester was the first city to have a local lockdown imposed after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and his colleagues realised that their initial reluctance to sanction such measures, in the interests of national unity, was mistaken. Public health experts and politicians in Bradford, Luton and Blackburn have all since added their voices to a chorus of disapproval for the government’s top-down handling of the deteriorating situation in particular places. Correctly, they argue that local authorities, and not outsourcing giants such as Serco and Sitel, should have been put in charge of infection control, and encouraged to make use of existing community links when telephone or email tracing efforts did not produce results.It is not yet clear what effect Sunday’s decision by Manchester police and politicians to declare a major incident, following a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, will have on Whitehall decision-makers or on the outbreak itself. A tightening of restrictions across an area also including West Yorkshire had been imposed by ministers several days earlier.As throughout this pandemic, the challenge for the authorities is to communicate in such a way as to maximise the positive effects on health, while minimising other harms, including the social isions created by the pandemic’s differential impact on different groups. Ceding more powers to councils is not, on its own, a solution. But ministers must, as a matter of urgency, get better at working as partners rather than bosses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b28a647ab60e68fe2385751c60106ec10c0270ad/0_214_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5359c9b0fc1f2a8e6dcec48bc28b2c08","title":"marcus rashford scores cover of british vogues september issue","story":"The footballer is recognised for his activism in the magazine among 40 ‘faces of hope’Marcus Rashford’s inspirational, policy-changing campaign against child poverty has garnered him accolades aplenty. Now it has also propelled the footballer on to the front cover of British Vogue’s September issue.The Manchester United striker, who forced a government U-turn on the granting of free food vouchers for the poorest families over the summer, headlines a special edition dedicated to activism.Rashford posed alongside Adwoa Aboah, the supermodel turned mental health activist, for the Activism Now issue. While Aboah has graced Vogue on several occasions, it’s a first time for Rashford.The footballer said: “I’m by no means a politician but I had a voice and a platform that could be used to at least ask the questions. If I didn’t put myself out there and say, ‘This is not OK and it needs to change,’ I would have failed my 10-year-old self.”The photograph was shot by Misan Harriman, the first black male photographer to shoot a cover of British Vogue in the magazine’s 104-year history. A predominantly black team was on set for the shoot.Rashford, whose campaigning has led to him becoming the youngest recipient of an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester, and Aboah, who founded the online mental health community Gurls Talk, head up the issue, which throws a spotlight on 40 “faces of hope”.They include the campaigner Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence  the American political activist Angela Davis the Sudanese student and anti-government protester Alaa Salah the British youth-enterprise campaigner Temi Mwale and the Justice4Grenfell campaigner Yvette Williams.The September issue of Vogue is regarded as the most important of the calendar. This year all 26 international Vogues are dedicating their issues to the theme of hope.“British Vogue’s interpretation is an ode to the extraordinary voices, the majority of whom are women, who have been critical to driving change forward,” the magazine said in a statement.British Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, said: “At its core, British Vogue’s September issue is our show of thanks, as well as a rallying cry for the future. When all is said and done, it’s clear that 2020 will be remembered as a tough year, but also as a moment of necessary change. One thing is for certain. The future starts now.”Others highlighted include the American fashion model Bethann Hardison, known for her activism on ersity in the fashion industry Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, the two young music executives behind the “Blackout Tuesday” social media protest in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and Patrick Hutchinson, the BLM protester photographed carrying a white football supporter to safety during anti-racist protests.British Vogue has also organised two activist roundtable talks. The first, hosted by Aboah, discusses community activism. The second, released on Wednesday, and introduced by Enninful, will be hosted by entertainment and sports agent Darnell Strom and will discuss 2020 as a watershed year for activism.As well as being the first black man to shoot a British Vogue cover, Harriman is the first black photographer to claim a prestigious September cover. Nadine Ijewere was the first black female photographer to shoot a cover of British Vogue, with covers in January 2019 and August 2020.Harriman said: “To be the first black male photographer in British Vogue’s 104-year history to shoot a cover is an honour, but let’s be clear, this has Edward Enninful written all over it. His ability to force change whilst empowering others is a lesson to us all. He knows that there are many talented people from a erse background who have never had a fair chance – finally the door is ajar.”Last year’s September British Vogue cover was guest-edited by the Duchess of Sussex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddde558d046b65f1f02f5a4550cc53bb2adfc7de/108_0_2231_1338/master/2231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61fae346e81d93376b6ed338d8f2511b","title":"the story of marine serres crescent moon catsuit","story":"The French fashion designer’s simple logo is laden with feminine symbolism, and has become the fashion talking point of the year, with fans from Beyoncé to Adele“Thank you, Queen, for always making us feel so loved through your art,” Adele wrote on Instagram, kneeling under a still from Beyoncé’s Black is King. The film was released on Friday, and Adele, like a paid-up member of the Beyhive, was twinning with her idol in a Marine Serre crescent-moon top.The 27-year-old French fashion designer Serre – who got the Karl Lagerfeld seal of approval when he described her in one of his final interviews as having “a will of steel” – made the upside down crescent the logo of her eponymous label when it launched 2017 after she won the LVMH prize (fashion’s version of the Booker). Since her debut show in 2018 she has since put her distinctive motif on leggings, dresses, balaclavas and her Nike capsule, as well as tops and bodysuits.The logo may only be three years old but it is in the lineage of Versace’s Medusa, Nike’s swoosh or Gucci’s Gs: simple, bold and hard to forget. “It harks back to the best logos, which essentially trade on being cult signifiers that you only know about if you’re in the know,” says British Vogue’s digital director, Ellie Pithers. It goes without saying that the shape is “Instagram-perfect”, too.In Already, the segment of Black is King where Beyoncé is wearing the Marine Serre catsuit, she sings: “Be your own king  Make nobody come rule your world.” Its message of self-determination fits into the symbolic meaning of the crescent moon. A symbol of life and fecundity, the moon was also seen as a female deity, epitomised by goddesses such as Artemis and Diana, who was depicted with a crescent on her brow – it stands in symbolic contrast to the sun because it reflects light instead of producing its own.“There’s a kind of ambiguity or a ‘fluidity’, as Marine told me when I interviewed her for Vogue,” says Pithers. “It’s wonderfully discreet but instantly recognisable at the same time, which is why I think it’s struck a chord.”Beyoncé wore a black-and-red crescent-moon catsuit from this collection to the NBA play-offs last May. Like the Black is King one, it covered her hands, arms and legs – giving the impression of a second skin. In the context of pandemic dressing and social distancing, this look is eerily prescient. With this reference of “apocalypse chic” and the current climate of pandemic anxiety, the crescent moon catsuit feels chillingly appropriate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4593ae29360abc04e361e3868d29265bd27ee31/98_22_1490_894/master/1490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492054727b4d10a8f68909813a7ee340","title":"an american pickle review seth rogen sarah snook brandon trost","story":"Rogen plays a pickle-factory worker accidentally preserved for 100 years – and the hipster great-grandson he shacks up with in 21st-century BrooklynSimon Rich is the New Yorker humorist and Pixar writer whose short stories are as addictive as crack. One of these, Sell Out, from his 2014 collection Spoilt Brats, has now been turned into a movie, with Rich as screenwriter and producer, cinematographer Brandon Trost making his feature directing debut, and Seth Rogen playing both the zany, twin-type lead roles: one with big bushy beard, one without.What was a very funny piece of writing has become a funny film, with a broad streak of conservative sentimentality added like artificial flavouring, all about an innocent in New York in the fish-out-of-water tradition of Borat or Crocodile Dundee. The film gives us some wry insights about work, family, the American dream and an ironised Topol-like wail of “Tradition!”Rogen plays Herschel Greenbaum, a dirt-poor Jewish road-digger in Słupsk, northern Poland in 1919, who has crazy dreams of one day being rich enough to afford his own gravestone. He has a humble cap, waistcoat, overcoat and patriarchal beard, and he has recently got married to the beautiful, proud Sarah (played by Sarah Snook – Shiv Roy in the TV drama Succession).When the Cossacks descend on a murderous, Jew-hating rampage, wiping out almost their entire village, Herschel and Sarah escape and emigrate to the United States where poor Herschel gets a job killing rats at a pickle factory in New York. But a terrible accident means he falls into the pickle vat and is preserved for 100 years, finally climbing out into the brave, new, super-hipster world of 21st-century Brooklyn, where he has to live with his great-grandson, Ben Greenbaum (also Rogen), who is an app designer.Herschel is frowningly dismayed at this baffling and meaningless job, and at Ben’s neglect of his family and his Jewish faith, and he sets out to redeem the family’s honour by setting up a business selling artisanal pickles from a worryingly familiar-looking cart, using a supermarket trolley and out-of-date ingredients pilfered from its dumpster. Could it be that Herschel’s ridiculous pickles will be more pungently real, more deserving of respect, and indeed more lucrative than anything in Ben’s specious existence?There are laughs along the way with Herschel and Ben’s mirror-image intergenerational, culture-clash roommate bromance. But, inevitably, as with so much high-concept comedy, the real laughs, the ones built on detachment, self-aware flippancy and cynicism, come at the beginning, with the establishment of the premise. As the story has to be teased out to the full three acts, empathy and investment are increasingly important. So is borderline-cornball emotion, although Rich manages this competently.In his original story, Rich appeared as himself (the modern-day Ben role), a playful self-deprecation in which he was a greedy and shallow writer supposedly working on his “novella” but always grabbing at high-paying Hollywood gigs, punching up (that is, adding jokes to) awful franchise scripts. Perhaps it is glib to wonder if this film isn’t a sellout in precisely the same way, but it doesn’t have the sharp, tickly, briny tang of the literary original.That was narrated from Herschel’s uncomprehendingly stern-naive point of view, whereas the film, inevitably, is the other way around. We are encouraged to see the quaint, antique Herschel from Ben’s viewpoint, while undoubtedly noticing the emptiness of Ben’s prosperous modernity – he has a fridge full of different vegan-friendly milks, and when taken to pray at his forebears’ gravesides, he takes out his smartphone and absentmindedly scrolls through animal humour websites. It is right for the two men to look alike, although casting Rogen in both roles, really the only important roles in the film, creates a weirdly claustrophobic effect, like a Charlie Kaufman film.In a way, it’s a shame that Snook couldn’t have been brought back into the story, either as a distant-cousin descendant or through having in some way flung herself despairingly into the pickle vat, although Herschel’s refusal to admit that his wife is gone is very funny. An American Pickle is a tasty, insubstantial snack of a comedy.• An American Pickle is in cinemas from 7 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd344aff9fdbdc8754b78c540add958dd5aff2ed/0_2973_5589_3354/master/5589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f78c613e9f0e16b3c4a45f1f95b0f950","title":"thomasina miers recipe for roast mushroom sweet potato salad balsamic onions","story":"Roast sweet potatoes in a smoky dressing with sweet balsamic onions, crisp, baked bread and tangy goat’s cheese My first trip to the US was a food pilgrimage to California. While in San Francisco, I visited Zuni Cafe, a restaurant famed for its roast chicken bread salad. I wanted to make a vegetarian version, and this is the result: crisp and juicy croutons sweet, sticky onions roast, garlicky mushrooms … it is a total feast and a nifty way to use up stale bread.This salad is a meal in itself, but it also goes very well with sausages, a burger or a chop.2 large sweet potatoes (about 500g)3 garlic cloves, peeled2 tsp smoked paprika (I use 1 tsp each of sweet and spicy), or ancho chilli flakesFlaky salt1 handful thyme, leaves only150ml extra-virgin olive oil400g mixed mushrooms, cut into bite-sized pieces2 large handfuls mixed salad leaves (I like baby gem and rocket), to serveJuice of ½ lemon80g goat’s cheeseFor the balsamic onions200g stale, rustic bread or sourdough, crusts removed2 large red onions, peeled and sliced2 tbsp balsamic vinegar1 tbsp soft brown sugarHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Cut the sweet potatoes in quarters lengthways, and then cut each wedge into three or four large, bite-sized chunks (they will shrink in the oven).Bash the garlic to a puree with the smoked paprika, a teaspoon of flaky salt, half the thyme and five tablespoons of olive oil.Spread the sweet potatoes out on a baking tray, toss in the oil and put in the oven. After 20 minutes, add the mushrooms and roast until everything is tender and caramelised.In the meantime, tear the bread into rough chunks and put on a second roasting tray. Add the sliced onions, the rest of the thyme, balsamic and sugar along with two tablespoons of the oil and four tablespoons of water. Season generously. Roast on the shelf below the mushrooms and potatoes until the onions are sweet and the bread is crisp and golden in places – 30-35 minutes.When you’re ready to eat, empty the two trays of vegetables on to a large platter or bowl, and toss with the salad leaves. Squeeze over the lemon juice, taste and check for seasoning. If the salad is at all dry, add another glug of olive oil. Crumble over the goat’s cheese and serve at once.Blitz leftover goat’s cheese with garlic, thyme and olive oil for a mouthwatering spread for bruschetta (a great way to use up stale bread).

They take on Brentford in a game that, according to Deloitte, could be worth more than £265m across five years if the winners avoid the drop next season.The major boost for Parker is the return to fitness of Aleksandar Mitrovic, the ision’s golden boot winner who missed the semi-final against Cardiff because of a hamstring complaint. “There is no bigger stage than now,” the Fulham manager said. “He has worked for this moment, to be able to help us achieve what we want to achieve.”Parker said the dynamics of the club were not conducive to achieving an instant top-flight return but, having put an onus on erasing the psychological damage of being relegated with five games to play, he believes Fulham have developed a thick skin. Only four players who started the final-day defeat by Newcastle last season are likely to line up at Wembley: Mitrovic, the captain, Tom Cairney, and the full-backs, Joe Bryan and Cyrus Christie.

At the forefront of my mind was trying to bring the club back together a little bit and try to create an environment and culture. In all successful clubs and businesses, it comes from a core foundation, when everything runs in the right way and everyone is on the same page. The club was very disjointed. We were in a bad spell. It has been a rocky road because you can’t just have a magic wand and go from real disbelief, a real weak mentality, and disconnection and within two months be fighting to win.”Fulham won seven Premier League matches in 2018-19, conceding a league-high 81 goals, but headed into the final day of this regular season with a chance of automatic promotion after winning five of their final seven games. They finished fourth, level on points with Brentford, who had a superior goal difference.Parker acknowledged the recruitment of players with Championship knowhow such as Michael Hector, Bobby Decordova-Reid, Harrison Reed, Ivan Cavaleiro and Anthony Knockaert – Cavaleiro and Knockaert have won promotion from the ision – had been important after big-money signings backfired in the Premier League.“We have seen many teams that look good on paper that have just fallen out of the Premier League and all of sudden they go and double bounce into League One or they are sitting 13th, 14th in the ision and do not win many games. Often it is because the culture is the same one which got them relegated the year before. The teams that often do well when they come down are the ones that have clear foundations.”Thomas Frank said he could take inspiration from an unusual source for his team-talk. “I could say A,B,C, D it doesn’t matter,” Brentford’s head coach said. “A fancy quote, or I could cry, I could laugh or joke. Sometimes, honestly, I don’t think it matters. But I love the American emotional stories about the big sports events and I would love if I can do an Al Pacino game inches speech.”Asked about his casual dress sense, Frank said: “It is important to wear what you feel relaxed in or good in … I think it is Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook who wears the same clothes every day so he doesn’t use up brain capacity thinking about that as well. I am pretty simple and not too fussed about how I look – so I do get a bit of killing from my wife.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae32418b836bc9e4e508b27bbacfa43b42a9483/310_4_4090_2453/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246b0845e4bc54c98ed1ed528f74dd5e","title":"sylvinho winning a treble with barcelona was spectacular arsenal wenger guardiola manager","story":"Former Arsenal defender on Wenger and Guardiola, managerial hopes, coaching Brazil and Inter and why the key to football is soul Sylvinho is laughing again, slapping a palm over his eyes before pulling it down to cover his mouth where an oh is forming. He recalls the scene, the embarrassment of the day after, and cracks up. It’s true, he concedes: there are pictures to prove it. “It’s a good story,” he says and the story goes that amid those wild, frantic seconds after Andrés Iniesta’s 93rd-minute winner at Stamford Bridge in 2009, while everyone lost their heads, Sylvinho chased Pep Guardiola down the touchline, grabbed him and, shouting through the din, signalled a safe passage to the final.“I could say: ‘Yeah, I was calm, I had it all under control, I knew exactly what to do, what was going on,’” Sylvinho says, grinning. “False. I remember Guardiola saying: ‘Keep the ball, be calm, don’t just shoot.’ But it’s not happening and in the last minute, a man down, Iniesta produces that shot. Goal. Everyone starts running. Some on to the pitch, some the other way. Everywhere. It was crazy, everyone going mad.” He waves his hand, the swirl of emotions, then clicks his finger. “I didn’t know what I was doing. It came from inside. There was a click. And I said something like: ‘Míster, there are two changes, eh.’”Which Guardiola made, by the way.“I didn’t know who I was talking to, what I was talking about, and when I saw footage the next day …” Sylvinho pauses, reaching for his face, and puts on a voice, the giggling horror, the what was I thinking? “‘Bloody hell that’s my boss.’ I was never a player who interfered with the coach I respected him, but it came from inside.”They’ve seen a lot of each other since, laughed about it too. Besides, maybe it was the manager trying to get out, an early glimpse of the coach inside.If maybe there was something there then, it’s definitely there now – expressed in the speed, depth and conviction with which Sylvinho talks in the discussion of systems, structures and sentiment and how convincing it all is. Even the cropped grey hair is good, he jokes: a manager’s look.Maybe it was inevitable the former Arsenal, Manchester City, Celta, Corinthians and Barcelona defender would become a manager with the mentors he had, the experiences and people he met and is still meeting now. The call has been running for 45min 54sec when he’s first asked about Arsène Wenger. “What. A. Coach,” he says. “Finishing without talking about Wenger would have been a sin.” But, then, there has been so much else to get in. Just the list of players he’s worked with as Brazil’s assistant manager is long. From Neymar: “Technically, physically and tactically spec-tac-ular and he didn’t give us a single problem.” To Dani Alves: “Obsessed with work.” And now two Premier League champions.“Alisson and Firmino are humble, serious, hardworking people who bring a team together,” Sylvinho says. “Alisson’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world even if he doesn’t ‘appear’ much. He doesn’t feel the need to tell the world ‘here I am’, doesn’t make a fuss or ‘sell smoke’, as the Spanish say.A run through the players whose path Sylvinho has crossed leads inevitably to Lionel Messi, a kid he says hasn’t changed. “He didn’t speak much: come in, train, go home, a great family behind him. We could see there was something there, wow. He was different. But I’d be lying if I said we thought: ‘This kid will win six Ballon d’Ors.’ I’ve never seen a player like him. He gets the ball, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, goal. ‘Done, let’s go home.’” Sylvinho dusts off his hands, laughs at the absurdity of it. “Messi has a bad season and scores 25. Barcelona have struggled but Messi is mucho Messi and they can still win the Champions League.”When Sylvinho joined Manchester City, where he would meet Mancini, it was the start of the club they are now but he says he could see something building: “A project, a plan, exactly the way they ‘sold’ it to me.” At the end of the season, he no longer had a playing place but Mancini offered him the chance to be third coach. “I said: ‘Thanks but I’ve been away from São Paulo 12 years, my parents are there.’ I was tired.”What about his job? Sylvinho laughs. “Arsenal are in good hands,” he says he spoke to Mikel Arteta last week. Besides, although he admits the Premier League is attractive, the field is wide – Spain, Italy, France, Portugal – and you can never wait for a club. Nor, he knows, are there any guarantees.There is, though, a long experience to draw on, influences from places and people, a mix of cultures: Spanish rondos, Italian tactics, English intensity. Sylvinho talks about bringing those together, finding a philosophy. About how fast the game moves and generations shift, about technology and methodology. And about how, if experience teaches you anything, it’s how often reality gets in the way.“It’s easy to write it down and say: ‘Do it.’ No. There has to be work, passion, you have to be in love with it. I always return to the same thing: soul.“Guardiola used to always say: ‘Lads, we’re going to do everything, everything, everything, everything. But I don’t know if we’ll win, I can’t guarantee that.’ Tite’s the same: he studies all … day … long. Locked away, studying. Mancini too, moving with the game. I see Diego Simeone, a great coach, lose two European Cup finals. Sometimes, the difference between winning or not is tiny. We won a treble getting there via Stamford Bridge with the last kick. Bloody hell. Pffff. How do you explain that?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929ec0d3305be22574c3cd26e5c9cee0d820f84a/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da51e6ac4c389858dc3282db595f1406","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6791a7923d490b106b74d785e2b141ff8301ce5a/179_0_5626_3376/master/5626.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=67f94db80daecc584c987fe9833b228c","title":"young british and black a generation rises podcast","story":"The death of George Floyd in the US provoked massive anti-racism protests in the UK.  reporter Aamna Mohdin discusses what she learned when she interviewed 50 young Britons at the heart of those ralliesFollowing the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK and across the world,  reporters Aamna Mohdin and Lucy Campbell interviewed 50 young black Britons, many of whom have been at the heart of the recent anti-racism protests, to find out what was driving them and ask what changes they would like to see in their lifetimes.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

The lightning promotion to run the newly merged department indicates the degree of haste with which decisions are being taken in Whitehall. Barton had only just started to make public appearances in India after promising to be a bridge between India and the UK. He was previously director general responsible for the UK government’s long-term strategic response to the coronavirus outbreak.He is in effect taking over from the current Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) permanent undersecretary, Sir Simon McDonald, who is standing down as part of a widespread changing of the guard at the top of Whitehall. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, is also retiring, as is the head of MI6, Alex Younger, who is being replaced by the political director at the Foreign Office, Richard Moore.Barton faces the task of pressing ahead with the merger of the FCO and Department for International Development (DfID), which is due to be completed by the end of September. The process will involve reforming departmental salary structures and deciding new lines of accountability between the old DfID staff in the field and the local diplomatic network.Many DfID staff fear their poverty reduction work will be undermined by a diplomatic staff determined to put UK commercial interests first.Barton will face the continuing consequences of leaving the EU, requiring the Foreign Office to move resources towards bilateral relations in inidual European capitals, and away from Brussels. He will also need to manage the consequences of a November presidential election in the US, which may not have a direct impact on future relations with China but could require a UK review of its relations with Russia and in the Middle East.Barton was acting chairman of the joint intelligence committee from 2016 to 2017.

Labour had discovered the explosives that would blow up Johnson’s seemingly bomb-proof three-word election campaign: “Get Brexit Done.”The documents Corbyn held up to the cameras brought together two of Labour’s most deadly attack lines: Brexit meant desperate free trade deals with the avaricious Americans, and the UK trade negotiators were secretly preparing to expose the NHS to the chill wind of the US private pharmaceutical industry. The beloved NHS was about to be sold to Donald Trump’s friends.Surrounded by smiling junior doctors, Corbyn said the 451 pages of unredacted documents “leave Boris Johnson’s denials in tatters and showed our NHS is already on the table for a toxic deal”. The documents covered six rounds of talks from July 2017 to “just a few months ago”.A flustered Conservative party tried to kill the sense of drama by saying the documents had already been available online for two months, and were simply a read out of working group meetings between officials. It later emerged the  may have seen the documents as the basis for a story back in July.The consensus was that papers had indeed been lying fallow on the social news site Reddit, unexploited by any reporter or politician.But within days of his dramatic press conference, the media – prompted by the Tories – were questioning the origins of the documents, and suggested they might have been put on to Reddit by Russian hackers.Labour’s Laura Piddock, one of Corbyn’s closest allies, thrown on the defensive, said it was a massive distraction to claim the authors were Russian. The document was an authentic British government paper. But by then Labour’s explosives had been made safe. The story was the origin of the document, and not its content.With days to polling day, the Sunday Times reported British spies had found the documents had been circulated on Reddit, three German-language websites and a Twitter account. They had a similar dissemination pattern – including grammatical errors – used by Secondary Infektion, a Russian operation exposed by Facebook.Reddit itself said it had banned 61 accounts linked to the release of the documents because it believed the leak was “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia”.There was no suggestion that Labour had acquired the documents illegally, although it could be argued the party did not advertise the fact that the documents had not been handed directly by a whistleblower.Last month on the eve of the publication of the much delayed intelligence and security committee report into Russian meddling into British democracy, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, formally confirmed the Reddit papers were part of a Russian hackers dump, and said there had been Russian effort to amplify the information’s existence, presumably through twitter.Now the near-final piece of the jigsaw has fallen into place. The documents were hacked from the office of the former trade secretary Liam Fox.Doubtless Corbyn will be criticised for being Russia’s useful but ineffective idiot, but it’s unlikely any politician in the moral maze of an election campaign will be so scrupulous as to spurn a chance to publicise an authentic and damaging document simply due to its murky origins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ebf1247026e8260dedc9192d21d554f14720e4/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f7072a764a0748aac6265b8cdc750263","title":"remains of 10000 year old woolly mammoth pulled from siberian lake","story":"Rare find includes skin, tendon and excrement of what is thought to be an adult maleRussian scientists are poring over the uniquely well-preserved bones of a 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth after completing the operation to pull them from the bottom of a Siberian lake.Such finds are happening with increasing regularity in Siberia as climate change warms the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world, thawing the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost.The woolly mammoth will probably be named Tadibe, after the family who discovered the adult animal, which is thought to have been a male between 15 and 20 years old, and and about 10ft (three metres) tall.Andrey Gusev from the Centre of Arctic Research, said the preservation of the animal was unique, with the lower spine still connected by tendons and skin, but that the retrieval operation was painstaking because the remaining bones were jumbled up.“We assumed that the bones were preserved in the anatomical order. But the first and the second days of our expedition showed that it was true only about the back part of the skeleton,” he said. “The rest of the bones were in such chaotic order that it was impossible to guess where they were.”Evgenia Khozyainova from the Shemanovsky museum in Salekhard, said: “We have one front and one hind foot well-preserved, with tendons, soft tissues and pieces of skin. Also we have sacrum with adjacent vertebrae, including the tail preserved with tendons and a big piece of skin.”Of particular interest is the excrement, or coprolite, because it will contain details of the animal’s diet, as well as pollen and other environmental clues.The cause of the mammoth’s death is not clear yet as no signs of injuries were found on the bones.Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia.Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia’s Far East in 2018.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d46ce0dbd31da0d371e583b13d746380029ee4/1610_106_4109_2465/master/4109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4790c9274815764e7dc68e681b758e","title":"covid 19 does more testing always mean more cases podcast","story":"Since the beginning of the pandemic, ‘test, test, test’ has been the key message from epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists and healthcare professionals alike.

And it says that hockey “has now become an elitist sport and is dominated at the top level in particular by those lucky enough to come through the private school system”.Gurmej Singh Pawar, the chairman of Barford Tigers, an inner-city Birmingham-based club who play in the third tier of the English game, told the  the letter was an attempt to “improve and rectify a system and culture that is both outdated and unrepresentative of modern-day Britain”.England Hockey’s board and senior management team is all white – while there was only one non-white player in the combined Team GB men’s and women’s squads at the Rio Olympics.“There doesn’t seem to be any overt structured attempt by England Hockey to tackle racism and discrimination in the sport,” said Pawar. “They seem to be light years behind other sports on this. I don’t know whether that is because they think it doesn’t exist, or they simply believe that it’s not their duty to do something about it. Either way, enough is enough and things need to change.“Young people who have dreams of playing for their country at the Olympics are potentially missing out because of racial stereotypes and biases. Further to that, if you are not white, middle class andor come through the private or grammar school system, your chances of playing for GB Hockey in a major tournament are greatly diminished.“It makes you wonder what talent England Hockey have missed out on or are currently missing out on because they are not doing enough to include a wider cross-section of society.”The letter, which is co-signed by eight other clubs from London, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham and Leeds, also says:Navraj Degun, a former England junior player, told the  of his experiences after being selected for an England Under-18s tour of Belgium in 2010. “It sounds positive, but the journey there and staying there was horrible,” he said. “People joking around with me that I have a ‘bomb on my head’, referring to my turban, or to be careful of ‘what is in my backpack’ is never really nice. You laugh at the time, but deep down you feel like shit.“At the time you don’t really think much of it as a kid, but subconsciously this demotivates you a lot. I didn’t feel like being there.”Sporting Equals, meanwhile, the UK’s leading charity for racial equality and ersity in sport, said its 2020 racism in sport survey had found several instances of abuse at grassroots and club level. One white respondent said he had heard “monkey chants being shouted at my teammate and the abuse of people from the opposition and the umpires”.He added: “Nothing got done with it. We got told we had no evidence and nothing happened to sort the issues out.”England Hockey was asked a series of questions about Pawar’s letter but instead released a statement to the  in which it said that its chief executive had reached out to Pawar personally since receiving the letter.“We are grateful to the clubs who have taken the time and energy to get in touch,” it said. “Our aspiration is for hockey to remain at the forefront of British team sports as a force for good in ersity and inclusion, with regards to race, gender, sexuality, disability and age. To that end, we as the governing body set up a ersity \u0026amp inclusion working group last year, with the aim of creating a long-term strategy.“The most recent step has been to create an external advisory group, utilising the skills and experience of people from a range of backgrounds within the sport, including the former chairman of Mr Pawar’s club Barford Tigers.”It added: “With regards to specific incidents, we strongly urge anybody with concerns to contact us directly at disrepute@englandhockey. We have a robust process to deal with any concerns. The most complexserious of those are dealt with by an independent panel.”Last week Sally Munday, who led England Hockey until 2019 when she became UK Sport’s chief executive, admitted that she was proud of the team’s many successes and should have done more to increase ethnic ersity on the field and in the boardroom.“When I look back at my time at England Hockey there are lots of things that I am incredibly proud of … but I believe I could have done more to increase ersity of black, Asian and ethnic backgrounds.”UK Sport said its ambition is to see the country’s high-performance athletes reflecting the ersity of British society. “That means challenging ourselves to ensure the sport we all know and love is truly inclusive and we are doing everything we can to stamp out racism,” a spokesperson said. “Together with our partners across the sports family, we must set out to drive the change we want to see.“With regards to specific allegations, we strongly urge anybody with concerns to contact England Hockey or the British Athletes Commission where appropriate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bd6092c62149af19358dfb5f8278a09210882b6/0_131_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b49a5eed1e02e806c39c8b0890874da","title":"itv finally set to renew its deal to broadcast racing until 2023","story":"ITV will continue to be the terrestrial home of horse racing under the terms of a new contract which is expected to be signed this week. An ITV board meeting will, it is anticipated, bring an end to a process that became much more fraught and drawn-out than seemed possible, given that both sides have every reason to be pleased with their association since an initial four-year deal began in January 2017.If rubber-stamped, the contract will mean the sport can continue to count on between 90 and 100 days of coverage per year, until at least the end of 2023, which will underpin its standing in the competitive sports environment.  understands ITV will pay more for its rights than under the previous contract, though the sum involved would pale into insignificance compared to the sums being lost to the sport due to the coronavirus crisis. As one insider put it: “Even £30m wouldn’t scratch the sides at the moment.”The parties involved declined to comment again on Monday, with a formal press release still in the works, but it is understood that there has been a smoothing-over of the problems with the negotiations which have made headlines from time to time. The sport’s most important racedays will continue to appear on the main channel and will not be consigned en masse to ITV4, as was suggested at one stage.The widespread view is that ITV has done well with its return to the sport, winning a Bafta for its coverage of the 2017 Grand National and reviving viewing figures. In that context, it was a surprise that talks about an extension have taken so long to reach a conclusion, with expectation of a new deal having been high at the start of 2019.Racing officials, slightly taken aback by ITV’s hard-nosed, commercial-minded approach to the talks, insist there is “no bad blood” now that the winning post is in sight.A nine-race card at Yarmouth on Monday was cut short after three races when an inspection of the course by jockeys deemed it was not safe to continue. The inspection was prompted by a fall in the closing stages of the third race by Lord Chapelfield, who suffered fatal injuries while his jockey, Gabriele Malune, was later discharged from hospital seemingly uninjured.Jockeys found a hole near the spot where Lord Chapelfield fell, but could not determine whether it had caused the fall or resulted from it. However, P J McDonald told Sky Sports Racing: “We found more holes and inconsistent ground where the turf was moving. It is not safe to race over and we had to do the right thing and call racing off.”But the clerk of the course, Richard Aldous, defended his track, saying: “We have had eight meetings on it and the ground has been no different. We have walked it every day and would have found anything if it was there.” He hopes an inspection by the British Horseracing Authority will result in the track being cleared to race again on Friday.Yarmouth’s home straight was dug up and relayed six years ago to eliminate the ridges for which it had become notorious and there were initial problems at the end of 2015 with patches of ground described as false by jockeys.

So the event, booms Cleese across rows of unoccupied seats in London’s Cadogan Hall, resembles nothing more than the annual convention of the Michael Palin fan club.The latter might be a jauntier affair. Cleese’s show is called Why There Is No Hope, and is less comedy show than lecture on people’s, and society’s, inescapable idiocy. None of us know what we’re doing, argues Cleese. Even clever people are profoundly irrational. And the people who seek and gain power are the worst of all. This gloomy thesis is footnoted with stats and choice quotes from a host who clearly knows – and cares – whereof he speaks. It’s also handed down to us by Cleese as if on tablets of stone – ironically, given that we’re being urged to feel less certain in our certitude.The presiding tone – patrician dismissal of everyone else’s imbecility – is amusing enough, and no stretch for Cleese. He’s very funny on organised religion making it up as it goes along. And the erudition is a pleasure in itself: I loved Alexander Pope’s “if you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to”.Of course, there’s a dose of what you always get with Cleese these days: alimony gags, a bit of PC-baiting. The humility he demands of others is nowhere in evidence. But Why There Is No Hope is more uplifting than it sounds. Our host may be pessimistic about our capacity to make the world better. But he reserves a small space for idealism, in a show notable for Cleese’s intellectual enthusiasm and – surprisingly, given how little we do to earn it – his faith in his audience’s intelligence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ca1ac411874f6ae07a02d54c0238f49593471f/0_277_5868_3523/master/5868.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ba3212256f2f820ce0f99c434d2d645f","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3171fd9d268d57131a070ee13fec2e868baaea4d/806_385_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c69b0dce53561eb8d345960e6a76018","title":"send a tip uk river walk win 200 pound holiday voucher","story":"Send us your very own tale of the riverbank and you could win a great prize from Canopy \u0026amp StarsIf you can never step into the same river twice, it follows that you won’t walk along the same bank twice.

It suggests it’s household to household,” the source said. “In the north-west, the problem is households, not pubs. So you can only go to the pub with your household.”Speaking on Friday after Boris Johnson delayed some easing measures as infection rates increased, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the country was “at the outer edge” of what could be reopened, and that if further rules were lifted, others would have to be tightened to compensate.Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) subgroup on pandemic modelling, said on Saturday that one option might be to close pubs when pupils return to school.Johnson’s spokesman, however, played down the idea and stressed the desire to avoid nationwide measures if possible.“Our approach is a localised one, where you would assess the situation on the ground and take whatever steps were required to slow the spread of the virus,” he said. “More broadly, we are committed to supporting the hospitality industry, which has had a very tough time. It employs more than 2 million people, predominantly young people, and it’s important that we continue to support it.”Asked what, if any, compensatory measures might need to be taken, he pointed to the measures introduced at the end of last week in the north of England, which barred people from different households from meeting indoors, and the subsequent declaration of a major incident in Greater Manchester.“Decisions will always be based on local evidence and scientific guidance,” he said. “We have in place a system now for localised lockdowns. You will see that in Greater Manchester, and in other areas, the steps that we have taken have been to restrict social contact, because that was what the experts considered was responsible for an increase in the prevalence of the virus.”The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.There will, however, still be a focus on other potential areas of spread, such as workplaces. Localised restrictions imposed on Leicester were connected to potential infections at garment factories.Some councils are believed to be concerned that not all business outbreaks are being reported quickly enough. Sandwell council in the West Midlands, which Public Health England has listed as an area of concern over rising case numbers, has urged firms to report any outbreaks promptly.No 10 is adamant to English schools will reopen fully after the summer. “You’ve heard from the prime minister on many occasions his absolute commitment to getting out children back into school in September,” the Downing Street spokesman said. “That’s vital for their education and their development. We are planning for all pupils in all year groups to return to school full time from the beginning of the autumn term.”The only exception could be “a very specific localised lockdown that might require a single school to close”, he said.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said on Monday that it was “totally unacceptable” that ministers had reportedly discussed the possibility of sealing off the capital if infections rose sharply there.Johnson’s spokesman said there were no plans to do so, but stressed that the idea of restricting travel into a badly affected area had already been outlined as a possible course of action.“If you look at the contain strategy, which we published just over two weeks ago, it sets out … the possibility of putting in place restrictions on travel if there’s an area that is particularly badly affected. One of the steps within that potentially includes closing down local transport networks. So it’s there, it’s contained in the document. It’s not a new thing.“But to be clear, it’s not something that is specific to London or anywhere else.”He also dismissed reports at the weekend that people over 50 might be asked to shield in the event of rising infections in the winter as inaccurate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f8eafda3f4cde1e1be3051d00a7e5ceafd39e18/323_0_2630_1578/master/2630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae14e573404cc05270bb3d76cc88008a","title":"my mother was ordered leave netherlands i cried non stop","story":"Natalia Robledo-Contreras had to fight from the age of eight to be recognised as Dutch and almost lost her family in the processIt felt like a dirty trick. Natalia Robledo-Contreras still has trouble believing what happened the day she and her younger sister first applied for a Dutch residence permit. An immigration official refused to accept the girls’ applications until their parents came with them. Robledo-Contreras, then 17 years old, and her lawyer were suspicious. What if this was a ruse to detain her parents, who like the sisters were undocumented in the Netherlands?But with the official refusing point blank to take their forms, her mother relented. She was detained immediately upon arrival. “I cried non-stop, even after my mum was released later that day,” Robledo-Contreras says. “She was ordered to leave the country immediately.”That day in 2012 marked the beginning of Robledo-Contreras’s long quest for legal status in the Netherlands, a country where she had already lived for nine years. At every stage she would try to do the right thing and every effort to comply with the rules would be used against her. The process would ultimately cost Robledo-Contreras her family.Her father left behind poverty and unemployment in Chile in 2001 after a relative helped him find a job in the Netherlands. But the job was off the books, so when a year later he brought his wife and two children to join him they also had no documents. As an eight-year-old, Robledo-Contreras had been reluctant to leave her home in Santiago. But she was a good girl, a trier who took responsibility. She excelled at school in the Netherlands.The family had tried for legal residency in the Netherlands via several different routes, but did not qualify. A lawyer advised Robledo-Contreras’s family to wait at least four years for the children to develop roots in the country, through school and Dutch language classes, before applying for the sisters’ residence permits. “Getting good grades would be good for my case, we thought, as a family,” she says. Robledo-Contreras, now a 25-year-old law student in Amsterdam, supports her studies by working as a cleaner but this has mostly dried up since the coronavirus pandemic broke out. But she recognises that others are even worse off: “Thousands of undocumented migrant domestic workers have also been let go by their clients.”She speaks softly, but there is passion in her voice when she talks about the struggles of working without papers. Activism runs in her family. Her mother protested against the Pinochet regime in Chile. “And my nanna is my big example,” she says. “She was in a women’s union for agricultural workers. I’m really proud of that.”Yet her own family, the source of her inspiration, has been turned into the main obstacle to her dream of achieving legal residence. After her mother was detained in 2012, the Dutch immigration services used her parents’ undocumented status as a reason not to grant residence to Robledo-Contreras and her sister. Restrictive immigration policies such as those in the Netherlands can create perverse incentives for undocumented families. With the path to legal status made tough for the heads of families, authorities fear it incentivises migrants to first try to obtain residence permits for their children. The immigration service used the argument that Robledo-Contreras’s parents might benefit from her legal status to apply for family reunification.“This is a standard argument used by Dutch immigration services against children in undocumented family cases,” said Robledo-Contreras’s immigration lawyer, Corinne de Klerk. Some families therefore isolate themselves from their children or deny they have contact, in order to strengthen their application. “I even know of a case where the parents pretended to have disappeared from the life of their child,” says De Klerk. The UN children’s rights treaty says countries should not discriminate against children based on their parents and that the best interests of children should be the primary consideration in immigration cases. Dutch opposition parties have proposed a bill to adopt this article into Dutch law.Since April, the Dutch centre-right liberal coalition government, led by Mark Rutte, has been under pressure from public protests to take in unaccompanied children from refugee camps on the Greek islands.But Dutch rightwing policians, including Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet, have long demanded hardline migration curbs and Rutte’s government is accused of pandering to the anti-migration message.Despite her never-ending uncertainty, Robledo-Contreras graduated near the top of her high-school class. She took her school reports to meetings with the immigration services. “All these good grades and my Dutch language classes were to show my integration into Dutch society,” she says. “But the officials used them against me. They told me that I was smart enough to adapt to a life in Chile.”In one meeting they told her she was not integrated enough, and in the next that she was too integrated.She was also required to “cooperate with her return” in order to apply for a permit. “They asked us to buy flights to Chile, to watch a Dutch reality television programme about people living a good life in Chile,” she says. This process often scares people into dropping legal procedures, according to De Klerk. “They pressure you to leave,” Robledo-Contreras says, with a sigh. “After a while you don’t know what to do any more to help your case.”After five years of battling the system, Robledo-Contreras lost an appeal in her case for a residence permit in 2017 and received an entry ban. From that moment, she was living illegally in the Netherlands.“I lost everything. I couldn’t even dream about a future for myself any more,” she says. The situation took a toll on her family. “You become unhappier over time and feel like blaming something for it. I started to blame my father for his decision to go to the Netherlands. I began to ignore him.” She looks at the ground, searching for the right words. “It’s the entire situation that slowly pushes you apart, into a position where you consider it might be better to cut the cord with each other.”The country of her birth had become a foreign idea. “Slowly Chile became further away for me. I grew attached to the Netherlands, mainly because I knew nothing else,” she says. She started working as a cleaner and joined the migrant domestic workers’ board of a Dutch trade union. “I didn’t want to be undocumented and do nothing for society.” Her sister, who has mental health issues, was still involved in her own residency application. Robledo-Contreras had also struggled with her mental health. “I couldn’t break down,” she says of her childhood. “My parents were working at least six days a week. Two ill daughters would be too much to handle for my family. Instead, I hid behind my school books.”After two years living without papers, Robledo-Contreras’s lawyer suggested adding her to her sister’s case, a common approach when one sibling’s case is stronger. She started the residency process again, terrified by the memories of her mother’s detention when they first applied. “Now it was me at serious risk of being deported immediately,” she says. She had a panic attack and went to see a psychologist, but was not able to access treatment due to her immigration status.In her last appeal in January 2019, she brought all the evidence she had to prove her ties to the Netherlands and show she was entitled to remain. In the end, the broken relationship with her parents became a decisive point in the case, as the authorities could no longer claim her parents would benefit from her status. Three months later, she and her sister received residence permits, 17 years after arriving in the Netherlands.“I can enjoy my life now,” she says. She continues to work with the migrant domestic workers network and campaign for better rights for undocumented workers, most recently those who have lost their incomes because of the pandemic. She has also enrolled on an undergraduate degree and hopes to qualify as a lawyer in three years. “When I’m walking to my university, I think: I’ve been wanting this for so long,” she says. “But this is followed by sad memories of everything that it cost.”The relationship with her parents remains strained. “We’re mending it now,” she says. “It’s much needed.” Asked how her parents see her today, she says: “They are proud of me. I think they are the most proud of the fact I’ve always continued to do things. That I didn’t break down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7606dcef37b40eca08ecd392e0b12652c3985a46/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a163fe9d8ff12efb694f31b925a5e4a","title":"uk virologists criticise handling coronavirus testing contracts","story":"Exclusive: experts say decisions apparently being made on ideological groundsA group of Britain’s leading virus experts say mistakes are being made in the handling of the Covid pandemic, with testing contracts awarded on apparently ideological grounds to private sector companies rather than based on expertise.In a letter to England’s chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser, nearly 70 clinical virologists say they have been sidelined by the government and excluded from discussions on how to respond to the pandemic.New 90-minute tests announced with fanfare by ministers on Monday were the latest example of how virologists were being bypassed, they say. They have been using rapid tests such as these already – but say they have no knowledge of or information on the DnaNudge or LamPORE tests that the government is contracting to buy.The UK Clinical Virology Network wrote to Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, on 10 July but say they have had no response. The experts in testing for viruses such as Covid-19 mostly work in 40 NHS and Public Health England (PHE) laboratories across the country.They were writing, they said in their letter, “to express our concern over lack of engagement by policymakers with clinical virology expertise in the UK in the management of the Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2 pandemic)”.The letter adds: “Our skills have been underused and underrepresented (albeit to differing extents within the devolved nations of the UK), resulting in lost opportunities to establish a coordinated robust and durable testing framework for Sars-CoV-2.”Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London, is one of the signatories. “There’s always new tests being developed. And it’s almost as if they’re being pushed as a sort of magic bullet … it’s almost like getting stuff out to actually reassure the public rather than the more boring but really hard work of doing proper contact tracing,” he told the .He and others think the government is convinced that only the private sector can rise to the pandemic challenges. But, he said, a series of mistakes and problems had arisen from failing to consult with clinical virologists.In March the government rushed into buying antibody tests that were then found not to work well enough.In the same month, it set up drive-through testing centres and so-called Lighthouse labs – privately and publicly operated – to increase the number of swabs taken and processed, but did not have the systems to feed the data into the NHS and public health authorities around the country, where it is needed.“If you’re going to build a Lighthouse lab or a new lab somewhere, to have it under control of an NHS laboratory would be the obvious thing,” said Pillay. “It was the first thing I said when Deloitte phoned me and asked me for advice on setting up Lighthouse labs.The only clinical virologist on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is from the main PHE reference laboratory, he said.Prof Will Irving at the University of Nottingham, another signatory, pointed to centralised control of the response when Lighthouse labs were set up. “We never quite reached capacity. We could have done more testing,” he said of the Nottingham laboratory. “But just like whoever first thought of that, I hadn’t thought it through. And in fact, the actual testing in the laboratory – of taking the sample and determining whether or not it’s got virus in it – is far and away the easiest part of the whole process,” he said.Diagnostic laboratories such as his had rigorous processes for getting the results where they should be, so patients could be treated, contacts traced and local public health officials notified of what was happening in their area.Instead, it emerged that some Lighthouse labs sent home volunteers because there were too few samples to process, while some patients got wrong or delayed results. “We heard stories about thousands of samples being sent to the United States for testing which is just plain ridiculous,” he said. “And it just seems there is a rush to do everything privately.”The virologists still hope they can help, advising that private testing centres and labs should be at least partnered with an NHS or PHE diagnostic laboratory. “It is not too late to effect change. The Covid-19 pandemic response will need to evolve through the coming winter and beyond … We ask that you reach out to the clinical and academic virologists in all countries of the UK,” the letter says.A government spokesperson said: “We have made significant strides in our approach to tackling coronavirus and have been guided by the latest scientific advice throughout … At every stage, the government’s response has been informed by the advice of experts from SAGE and its sub-committees. Our approach is kept under constant review as new international and domestic evidence emerges.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72ffc4e900b7655c3ec85b8de0c8a9988105aba/0_163_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c286191fde390967cc581ea22e8e63e2","title":"a small but powerful signal mumbai instals female figures on traffic lights","story":"Campaigners in India say the move helps dispel the notion that only men should be out in publicMumbai has become the first city in India to introduce female figures on its traffic lights, a move welcomed by campaigners as a step towards greater inclusivity.Authorities are swapping the green and red male stick figures for female figures on more than 100 pedestrian crossings as part of a broader plan to make roads more pedestrian-friendly.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner with Mumbai’s municipal corporation, said: “The signage reflects the character of the city ... that it believes in gender equality and promotes women’s empowerment. This is just the start.”Equality campaigners said the change may appear small, but was significant. In many Indian cities, women make up only a small proportion of the people on the streets.“If a generation of little girls grow up seeing women figures on the traffic signals, it sends a small but powerful signal that women belong in the public,” said social scientist Shilpa Phadke.“The presence of such symbolism in the public might undo the idea that the imagined person on the street is male ... this is symbolically valuable in the long run,” said Phadke, co-author of Why Loiter? Women and Risk on Mumbai Streets.India’s financial capital already runs women-only coaches on suburban trains and reserved seating on buses, and is widely regarded as one of the country’s safest cities for women.Women in India have to deal with multiple safety issues, from dimly lit lanes to crowded public transport, though cities and states have initiated steps to make public spaces more accessible in recent years.The country was rated as the most unsafe in the world in a 2018 Thomson Reuters Foundation survey.Delhi last year announced free public transport for women to boost their mobility, and several Indian states give out free bicycles to girls to ensure they do not drop out of schools for lack of safe or accessible public transport.

Here’s some analysis from our correspondent, Helen Davidson:For the first time in two weeks Hong Kong has reported fewer than 100 new cases of Covid-19 in a day.On Monday evening health authorities said 80 people had been diagnosed with the virus, with the infection source unknown for 24 of them.Hong Kong is experiencing its third and worst wave of the outbreak since the virus first appeared there in January. Driven largely by community transmission, 2,342 of Hong Kong’s 3,590 total cases have been recorded in the past month.The centre for health protection said they would observe the trend over the coming days before making any determination about whether the infection rate was declining.Strict social distancing measures, which were due to expire on Wednesday, have been extended another week. Pools, beaches, gyms, and various clubs will remain closed, and restaurants will continue to be limited to takeaway services between 6pm and 5am, with a maximum of two people at a table the rest of the time. The government had banned all dine in services last week but quickly reversed the decision after community backlash.Citing anonymous sources, the South China Morning Post said mainland Chinese experts deployed to Hong Kong last week are assisting the construction of two temporary Covid-19 hospitals, and increased testing. Photos published in Chinese state media, Xinhua, show hundreds of beds separated by temporary iders in an exhibition hall of the AsiaWorld-Expo centre, which opened Saturday. According to the SCMP, this will be expanded with another 400 beds in a second hall.The high number of infections has threatened to overwhelm Hong Kong’s public hospital system. Unlike other countries, which allow, encourage, or even require Covid-19 patients to recuperate at home if they have mild systems, Hong Kong sends everyone to a hospital isolation bed.As of Monday there were 1,243 patients in the 1,256 beds across 19 hospitals and one community isolation facility.Of those, 43 people are critical, 49 in serious condition, and 1,151 stable. New Zealand has recorded no new cases of Covid-19. There are now just 22 cases of the disease in the country, all in managed isolation.But the country’s health director general, Ashley Bloomfield said a single case outside of the quarantine facilities could turn into a wider outbreak if people were not vigilant. “We have worked too hard to let that happen here,” he said at a news conference.South Korea’s Yonhap news agency is reporting that two members of the army have tested positive for coronavirus, citing the defence ministry. Yonhap says one is a draftee and the other is a military intelligence command officer: The soldier based in Pocheon, some 45 kilometers north of Seoul, has been in isolation after coming into close contact with an outside counselor who was infected with COVID-19 late last month, according to the ministry.The soldier tested positive on his second test required to exit mandatory quarantine, it added.The counsellor was found to have visited several front-line units in the Pocheon areas before he tested positive, and 19 virus patients at the barracks are believed to be linked to the man.The other fresh case is a warrant officer affiliated with the Defence Security Support Command in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, according to the defence ministry.He appears to have contracted the virus after visiting a restaurant in Seoul where a COVID-19 patient stayed, command officials said, adding that contact tracing is under way.The Beijing-baked Global Times has reported that Hong Kong has confirmed 78 new cases of coronavirus, citing to China’s National Health Commission. Andrews is now announcing new fines for anyone who breaches their isolation orders:If you are supposed to be at home and you are not, then you face the prospect of a fine of up to $5,000. If there were repeat breaches, if there were particularly selfish behaviour like, for instance, going to work when you had the virus, then there is the alternative pathway and that is, of course, taking you to the magistrates court, where the maximum penalty that can be applied to you is $20,000.These are substantial new penalty measures. Andrews says the on-the-spot fine is the largest on the statute books in the state of Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state.We are hearing a news conference form the premier of the Australian state of Victoria, which is battling a major coronavirus outbreak. Daniel Andrews says there are 439 new cases in the state and 11 new deaths. All of the deaths were in aged care settings.On Monday Andrews announced major new restrictions in the state for another six weeks to try to get control of the virus. You can follow all the live updates on this story on our Australian live blog here.Andrews says of the 3000 people visited who should have been self-isolating, 800 were not at home. He says the system will change so that anyone who should be self-isolating will not be able to leave their homes for exercise. “You will need to stay in your home or on your property. Fresh air at the front door. Fresh air in your front yard or backyard or opening a window. That’s what you’re going to have to do,” Andrews says.China has reported 36 new cases of Covid-19 (including 6 imported cases). Of the 30 local cases, 28 are in the western province of Xinjiang, and two in the eastern province of Liaoning. Of the six imported cases four are in Guangdong, one in Shanghai, and one in Sichuan.A 22-year-old female passenger on board the cruise ship Paul Gauguin has tested positive for Covid-19, and has been isolated in French Polynesia.The woman was tested for Covid-19 before departing the United States for French Polynesia. She initially tested negative, but a subsequent test, on board the ship (following French Polynesia protocols), returned a positive result.The woman, who was asymptomatic, was isolated and the ship – sailing between Bora Bora and the Rangiroa islands – turned around for its home port, Papeete, in Tahiti, docking early on Sunday morning.Testing of passengers and crew who were in contact with the woman, as well as her mother, with whom she was travelling, have all returned negative results.Passengers have been disembarked under a cordon sanitaire: crew members will remain in quarantine on board for seven days.All passengers and crew will be re-tested within a week.Vietnam is in the midst of a “decisive” fight against the novel coronavirus, its premier said on Monday, focusing on the city of Danang where infections have appeared in four factories with a combined workforce of 3,700.As Reuters reports, Vietnam was widely praised for its mitigation efforts since the coronavirus appeared in late January, but is battling several new clusters of infection linked to Danang after going more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission.“We have to deploy full force to curb all known epicentres, especially those in Danang,” official broadcaster Vietnam Television quoted Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc telling government officials.“Early August will be the decisive time within which to stop the virus from spreading on a large scale.”The country of 96 million has confirmed at least 642 infections, with six deaths.Authorities on Monday reported 22 new cases linked to Danang, in central Vietnam and a tourism hot spot where the country’s first domestically transmitted case in 100 days was detected on July 25.The source of the new outbreak is unclear but it has spread to at least 10 places, including the capital Hanoi in the north and the business hub of Ho Chi Minh City in the south, infecting almost 200 people and killing six.Authorities in the Philippines have had to reimpose curbs after infections surged past 100,000, forcing more than 27 million people – including in the capital Manila – back into lockdown for two weeks from Tuesday.President Rodrigo Duterte has approved placing  Manila and nearby provinces such as Laguna, Cavite, Rizal and Bulacan under so-called “Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine” until 18 August.Some businesses and public transport are expected to be closed in the capital, which is currently under the less restrictive General Community Quarantine classification.Latin America broke through 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday according to a Reuters tally, underscoring the region’s position as the area of the world hardest hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic.Reuters says the more than 10,000 new cases Colombia’s health ministry reported on Monday pushed the region past the 5m mark, a day after the Andean nation reported a record 11,470 cases.Mexico has also racked up record numbers of new confirmed infections in recent days, registering more than 9,000 daily cases for the first time on Saturday, a day after Mexico overtook Britain as the country with the third-highest number of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday it reported 4,767 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 266 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 443,813 cases and 48,012 deaths.In the region’s second hardest-hit country, Peru, daily cases have almost doubled from 3,300 to 6,300 since bus and air travel resumed a month ago, according to official figures.Across Latin America, which has now topped over 200,000 deaths, countries are struggling to stall the spread of the virus, with infections picking up pace in many countries even as governments look to ease lockdowns and revive economic growthThe chief of staff to Jair Bolsonaro, General Walter Souza Braga Netto, has tested positive for Covid-19, his office said on Monday, becoming the seventh Brazilian minister to have contracted the disease. Braga Netto is doing well and has no symptoms, the office said in a statement. He will remain in isolation until a new examination and medical evaluation is carried out, and will continue to work remotely.Last week, Bolsonaro’s wife tested positive. Bolsonaro also contracted the disease in early July. On Monday he told reporters he was fine and was already cured, after last week saying he was on antibiotics for an infection. Brazil has the second-worst coronavirus outbreak in the world after the United States, with more than 2.75m and 94,665 deaths, according to health ministry data.President Trump has rejected a national lockdown to bring the coronavirus pandemic in the US under control at one of his White House press briefings. “It’s important for all Americans to understand that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path towards producing the result that you want,” Trump said, arguing that lockdowns cause more harm than good.The president said the US had done “very well” fighting the virus.The US has recorded 4.7m cases and more than 155,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. The rolling seven-day average of new cases is trending slightly down at 60,488 cases per day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.He also announced he had signed an executive order expanding access to tele-health services for 57 million Americans in under-served rural areas and elsewhere, after virtual visits soared during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump, who is counting on votes from backers in rural areas in the presidential election, said the new order would ensure that tele-health services expanded during the pandemic remained in place even after the public health emergency ended.As our  US blog, Lois Becket writes: “As Trump touts his administration’s efforts to keep rural hospitals functioning during the pandemic, it’s worth noting that the number of rural hospitals that closed permanently this year rose to 13 today, according to the NC Rural Health Research Program. In all, 130 rural hospitals have closed in the past decade.The World Health Organization chief has said he is pleased about the progress that has been made in in identifying treatments that can help people with the most serious forms of Covid-19 recover. However, he has warned that there may never be an effective vaccine.“A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection,” the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment and there might never be.”Speaking in Geneva, he said for now, stopping outbreaks comes down to the basics of public health and disease control. “Testing, isolating and treating patients, and tracing and quarantining their contacts. Do it all,” he said. “Inform, empower and listen to communities. Do it all.”For iniduals, it’s about keeping physical distance, wearing a mask, cleaning hands regularly and coughing safely away from others. Do it all.The message to people and governments is clear: do it all.And when it’s under control, keep going! Keep strengthening the health system.Keep improving surveillance, contact tracing and ensure disrupted health services are restarted as quickly as possible.Keep safeguards and monitoring in place, because lifting restrictions too quickly can lead to a resurgence.You can read his full remarks here. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Alison Rourke. There might never be a “silver bullet” for Covid-19 in the form of a perfect vaccine, and the road to normality could be long, the World Health Organization has said. In a news conference in Geneva, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “A number of vaccines are now in phase 3 clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment – and there might never be.”Donald Trump meanwhile held another of his coronavirus briefings, in which he said the US is doing “very well” in fighting the virus. “We have done as well as any nation,” he said, pointing to other countries battling second waves. “China’s having a massive flare up right now,” he said. The president also pushed back against the idea of a national lockdown to stop the spread of the virus: “It’s important for all Americans to understand that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path towards producing the result that you want,” Trump said, arguing that lockdowns cause more harm than good.In other coronavirus developments:"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"In throwing out State\u0026rsquos climate plan, judges have done a service to Irish democracySmall farms inhabit some of the most at-risk landscapes, including hillsides, deserts and floodplainsNational agenda derailed by judgment, but Minister notes decision key to political focus"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Colin KeeganThe Cabinet will on Tuesday consider proposals to reduce the number of countries to which people are permitted to travel without having to restrict their movements upon their return. Ministers will discuss proposals to shorten the travel “green list” alongside other measures to tighten restrictions on those arriving into Ireland from Covid-19 hotspots.It is understood that Malta and Cyprus may be removed from the green list.Senior Cabinet figures have also warned they are “not optimistic” about pubs reopening next week.The Cabinet will discuss recommendations on the roadmap to reopening from the National Public Health Emergency Team as well as proposals to tighten up travel restrictions.It is understood the option of departure Covid tests will form part of the discussion whereby a passenger would have to take a test before they arrive in Ireland.Government sources said that while the focus remained on ensuring that schools could reopen at the end of the month, it was unlikely there would be any major change in international travel policy until September when the schools return.Hotspot traffic“We need to be realistic about international travel. You can’t cut off business, travel, and people seeing their partners and loved ones for a year or years,” a source said ahead of the Cabinet meeting.The Government is likely instead to look at ways to reduce risk when it comes to travel within Europe with tighter restrictions when it comes to travel to and from hotspots.The Department of Transport was asked by the Cabinet a fortnight ago to investigate the efficacy and potential of a system which would see passengers having to undergo Covid tests prior to their departure for Ireland.It was envisaged the test would be taken within 24-72 hours prior to travel and proof of a negative test result would be presented to Irish immigration officials on arrival.Under such a system, the cost of the test would be borne by the traveller rather than the State.It was also envisaged that, under such a process, intending passengers who were found to be positive for Covid-19 would not undertake their planned journey. This would avoid the necessity to test all other passengers in the event of one traveller being found to be Covid-19 positive after the journey was made.HSE fundingMeanwhile, as Ministers prepare to consider the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in Ireland, doctors have warned of a “gaping hole” over funding at the heart of the new Health Service Executive plan to recommence health services which was shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic several months ago.The Irish Hospital Consultants’ Association (IHCA) said on Monday it had raised concerns with Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly at a meeting in recent days over the HSE plan for a safe return to services published in late July.The Department of Health said in response: “The HSE receives significant funding from the State, and additional funding has been provided to the HSE this year to support its response to the Covid-19 crisis. Funding for the HSE will be kept under review as the provision of non-Covid services resumes.”Meanwhile, the latest figures show there have been no further deaths related to Covid-19 in the State but 46 new cases are confirmed.This means the death toll from the virus remains at 1,763 while the total number of cases in the State rises to 26,208.The five-day average is 53.4, a figure boosted by the 85 cases reported on Thursday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Backbench TD accused public servants of \u0026lsquolying on couch\u0026rsquo while binging on box setsMigrant workers and local students are helping the sector through labour shortageRabbit haemorrhagic disease means hare-coursing licences likely to stay suspendedKerry native lauds commitment of one social worker, mother\u0026rsquos love and youth workers\u0026lsquoHe taught us that it is better to live for Ireland than to die for Ireland,\u0026rsquo says EastwoodResearchers claim absence of consistent benefit and that evidence has been ignoredMary Seery Kearney was \u0026lsquophysically sick\u0026rsquo after reading physical and sexual threats onlineGuidelines advise RSA board members to treat negative commenters like \u0026lsquoan angry mob\u0026rsquoPubs unlikely to reopen amid 46 new cases and talk of pre-departure tests for visitorsCorruption and terror are key obstacles to progress in the country for Irish Coast Guard chiefNot \u0026lsquotolerable\u0026rsquo some schools refuse to set up specific classes despite demand from parentsFormer SDLP leader was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for his role in Northern IrelandHume \u0026lsquocommitted to pursuing objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means\u0026rsquoUnion president calls for elimination of two-tier structure ahead of schools reopeningNo deaths are reported on Monday as Glynn calls for collective \u0026lsquoencouragement\u0026rsquoBernard Geasley (40) had been fishing with friends at Ballincollig on Sunday eveningTeenager dragged from car by third occupant in critical condition in hospitalThe 12 nuns plan to complete the marathon distance of walking in prayer in seven hoursGarda operation was targeting the sale and supply of drugs in Kildare, Laois and OffalyStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321023.1596491864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"charities to be able to apply for 6m raised in rt%C3%A9 does comic relief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComedian Deirdre O’Kane, a member of the Comic Relief in Ireland steering group, said it was a ‘key step for the project and brings us closer again to delivering help to where it’s needed’.

In guidelines drawn up on how to deal with negative social media commentary board members were told to avoid becoming involved in lengthy online spats. “You don’t have to reply to everything. If the comment is clearly an attack or an effort to pick a fight, let it go,” state the guidelines. “Act as if you are responding to an angry mob: being right might not be the end goal,” the guidance said. The guidelines were circulated to the road safety organisation’s board last September and released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act.Internet trolls, a name given to those who (often anonymously) post inflammatory or aggressive comments on social media, should not be responded to negatively, noted the guidelines. If board members found themselves at the centre of a social media pile-on or “under attack by trolls”, they were advised to log offline for several hours. The guidelines said persistently problematic accounts should be muted rather than blocked, and would then no longer appear on their social media feed. “Eventually they will move onto the next perceived issue and they will not have the satisfaction of you blocking them – something that they will happily screenshot and tweet to their followers,” stated the document. The authority’s board was advised to take screenshots of iniduals posting “negative or controversial comments”, to keep a record of the post in case the issue “escalates to a more serious matter”.Advice to keep it coolBoard members were advised to “keep it cool” and bear in mind a troll or offended customer was often “trying to get an emotional reaction”, the document stated. The guidelines advised against deleting posts on Twitter if they attracted controversy. “If you do delete a tweet it will almost certainly have been screen grabbed by someone on the internet. It will only aggravate the commenter, or move the conversation elsewhere,” states the guidelines. “Deleting things on the internet is an illusion anyway, and will bring into question your integrity to not only the complainer, but all your followers,” it said. “Once the mob have moved on to the next issue, consider were there any iniduals who might be worth engaging with offline, in a calmer setting,” who could be contacted by phone or email, the guidelines noted.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4320052.1596381987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup s brexit ads who bankrolled the secretive 435 000 campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Geoghegan contends that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign. Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

But Reynolds’ current role is anything but typical.Since September 2019, the Dublin man has served as Head of Mission for EUCap, the EU’s mission to rebuild the rule of law in Somalia, with particular focus on building up a maritime policing capacity.“The risk here is so high. We take it very, very seriously,” said Reynolds, speaking from EUCap’s compound in the “Green Zone” – Mogadishu International Airport.The compound is protected by a line of Somali troops, a line of African Union troops and internally by a private security company. Even then, it is still regularly attacked with mortars by al-Shabaab, a terrorist group allied to al-Qaeda.“When we go outside, we go as a convoy. We use local security at front and behind and we have at least two armoured vehicles with our own armoured people inside. They could take a couple of rounds but a big explosion would be different. We don’t get out of the vehicles until inside another compound.”Reynolds, who was awarded the EU’s military support medal earlier this month, laughs when asked whether his family joined him in Mogadishu after he was seconded from the Irish Coast Guard.“Oh God no. You couldn’t bring your family.”The Terenure man is one of five Irish people on the EUCap mission and the first Irish head of an EU civilian capacity-building operation.Being Irish has its advantages in building relationships in the war-torn country.“It can open a lot of doors and make people relaxed. Ireland has a special place when it comes to working in places like Africa.‘Trouble with our neighbours’“The Somalis are the Irish of Africa,” he continues, recalling a quote from the 19th-century explorer Richard Burton. “Surrounded by beautiful waters, a history of famine, a history of migration. And we always have trouble with our neighbours.”His past experience as an officer in the Irish Naval Service has also helped and he would welcome more Defence Forces members on his 111-strong team.“It would be fantastic to get a Navy guy here. The Irish Navy is absolutely ideally suited. They do a lot of Coast Guard functions like fisheries protection, drug interdiction, security and safety. And they are extremely well trained.“I recognise they have recruiting problems at the moment but maybe with Simon Coveney as Minister for Defence as well as Foreign Affairs, you never know.”When Irish people think of Somalia, if they think of it at all, it is most likely piracy that comes to mind. Indeed, the main aim of EUCap’s predecessor mission Nestor was the suppression of the piracy which has plagued the horn of Africa in recent decades.Today, according to Reynolds,“piracy is well suppressed”. This was achieved by giving Somalis reasons not to tolerate it. This includes building up ports, the fishing industry and the rule of law.“You don’t chase pirates, you chase politicians,” he says.Much of this is mundane-sounding work, like helping to pass maritime legislation and establish maritime courts.Reynolds says his most difficult task is the establishment of a“blue water” coast guard to patrol Somalia’s resource-rich waters. Other jobs include setting up a“brown water” policing capability to protect the ports, and the establishment of a military-style police force to aid in the fight against al-Shabaab.Measures such as these will allow Somalia to“regain its place as a sovereign nation” after almost three decades of civil war, he says.Rather than piracy, the biggest obstacle to progress currently is al-Shabaab.Close-quarters assassinations“Mogadishu is still very, very dangerous. There are a lot of close-quarters assassinations. We had a vehicle-borne IED just the other day,” he says.The other, related, issue is that of corruption, which Reynolds says is a“way of life” in Somalia.“In many ways you can’t blame the Somalis. It was the way they survived. And al-Shabaab are at the route of all corruption. It’s endemic.”The historic lack of a strong central government can also frustrate reform efforts.“You think you have a grasp on what’s going on, you think you’re moving forward, then all the pieces change. The guy you’re dealing with is swapped to another job and suddenly no one is responding to our phone calls.”Nevertheless, he is cautiously hopeful about the future. Reynolds has been in Somalia in various positions for four years now.“It is a positive trend but you have to be here for four years to see the positive trend. If you’re here for six or eight months you can’t see it.”Although the country is still extremely dangerous, violence has decreased and economic life has started to return to the streets of the capital, he says.Reynolds’s term is up at the end of the year. He says if his mandate is renewed he will have to consult with his family and the Irish Government before deciding to stay on.“I think if it was offered I would be very open to seeing this out.

Photograph: Yorgos KarahalisBloombergIn case you’re wondering, yes, “pandemic” is a Greek word, meaning “affecting all the people”. Which is one reason why Greece has taken the Covid virus so seriously, and with such success.The disparate responses to coronavirus among EU member states and, of course, worldwide, suggests that each state responds according to its weaknesses, needs, fears and external influences.It would be unrealistic for an EU summit to attempt to impose rules on social distancing in every member state, but the lack of a unanimous, unified EU policy on the virus means there are no universal European rules about inter-state travel, testing for infection or contact tracing, leading to widespread confusion about what is permitted or even advisable. It is notable that the European country that was most successful in restricting Covid should be one of the most at risk once the gates were opened. However cautious the authorities have been, the inevitable – and foreseen – increase in infections has underlined the dilemma.In Greece, once the airports opened from July 1st onwards, at least 50 per cent of infections were identified at points of entry. In Corfu, where I live, the numbers infected went from 0 to 29 during July the carriers were Serbs, Bulgarians, British, German and French. The rates on the single land border with Bulgaria were so high that Greece insisted that anyone presenting themselves at that point must show a negative test conducted within the previous 72 hours. Serbian visitors were banned absolutely.So sharp was the rise in infections in the last week of July that a return to the familiar restrictions is contemplated. Masks are now mandatory in all confined public places.Patriotism and nationalismThe pandemic has demonstrated the narrow line between xenophilia (the natural courtesy towards guests) and xenophobia (fear of what the foreigner might bring). It has also shown the difference between patriotism and nationalism. One appeals to a sense of responsibility and loyalty the other to a sense of identity and security. The term “pandemic” applies not only to Covid and other destroyers of life and liberty: as an adjective, it reflects the ultimate aspirations of the EU: to embrace all people within its remit in the same egalitarian and inclusive way of life. In this, Covid has shown how deeply it has failed.With the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland (the “frugals”) opposing the proposed financial package at July’s EU summit, and Hungary and Poland giving cause for concern over the “rule of law”, the southern states most hit by the virus, in terms of tourism – Spain, Italy, Greece and Croatia – run the risk of being ignored in both political and financial terms. Meanwhile, non-EU states such as Turkey see themselves as exempt from any common approach to a universal problem. “Covid” simply means different threats and opportunities depending on where you sit.There is a massive ision between those who espouse “do as you would be done by” and the Nimbies (“not-in-my-backyard”). Every country protects itself but also yields to its weaknesses. Greece’s weakness is its sunshine. If Greece were Finland or Greenland, the threat to its economy would be minimal.Meanwhile, another kind of “nimby” manifested itself in Corfu, where huge local protests were voiced when prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis personally endorsed an embryonic exclusive tourism resort during a visit to the island. Despite opposition by the local authority, public opinion and wealthy local landowners including the Rothschild family, the government actively supports the project by US-based NCH Capital on the deserted, pristine headland of “Erimitis”. It’s an example of the need for Greece to attract foreign investment, in this case at the cost of diminishing the unique ecosystem of the area. Erimitis contributes nothing to the national economy except its beauty and tranquillity. So in terms of productivity, it’s a waste of space. Thus it also highlights the eternal debate in Greece between the need to modernise and to capitalise on its assets, and the issue of identity and what constitutes “Greekness” for both the country and its people, their culture and their traditions. Almost every year, those responsible for developing tourism policies declare the end of “mass tourism” – resorts and cruise ships being the most obvious examples – and every year more resorts are built and more cruise ships are accommodated. A self-contained resort, like that planned for Erimitis, or a cruise ship docking in Corfu for less than 24 hours, contribute almost nothing to the local economy.The other options – the much vaunted development of niche markets such as wine and food tours, festivals of literature, film and music, ski slopes, ing schools, or hill-walking – don’t get the support or encouragement at national level that they need to enter the international tourism market. Highlighting skills in cuisine and viniculture, visual arts, music and handcrafts could not only enhance Greece as a tourist destination but open markets worldwide.Brenda Fitzsimons takes a look at the recent flooding from an Irish Air Corps helicopterStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Agreement also reached to join forces with the military in conflict with Houthi rebels\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318845.1596206285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk outlines brexit talks timetable running into october","story":"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue discussing a free trade deal until October 2nd, British chief negotiator David Frost said on Friday.“Negotiating rounds will take place in August and in September, unless agreed otherwise between the parties,” according to a document Mr Frost posted on Twitter.A fifth round of Brexit talks between ended last week with both sides saying they were still far from reaching an agreement.

In 2015, less than five months into his first term as governor of Maryland, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He began intensive chemotherapy to eradicate the dozens of tumours doctors found throughout his body.“Was this really how it was all going to end?” he asks in his new book, Still Standing. The answer was a decisive no. After a year of intensive and gruelling treatment, during which he continued to run the state of Maryland from his hospital bed, he was declared cancer-free.While Hogan’s personal story of triumph over adversity helped cement his standing with millions of Marylanders, his national profile has soared in recent months.Hogan is one of an increasingly rare breed in US politics – an anti-Trump Republican. The 64-year-old Irish-American governor was one of the few senior Republican figures to publicly admonish Donald Trump as the businessman-turned-reality television star stealthily built his lead during the Republican primary cycle of 2016.\u0026nbspOn election day 2016, he did not vote for Trump.In recent months he has become one of the most recognisable faces of the coronavirus crisis. As chair of the National Governors’ Association, he is one of several governors across the country who have taken the lead on the Covid-19 response, as the White House has fumbled.In April, he chartered a plane from South Korea carrying 500,000 tests for the citizens of Maryland, building on personal connections through his wife, who is Korean-born. (Hogan’s own background is rooted in Cork – all four of his great grandparents emigrated to the United States from Cobh.)Hogan’s high media profile – underpinned by the release of his new memoir – prompted speculation that he could challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in this election cycle. But ultimately he chose not to run. He is now being discussed as a possible candidate for 2024.Political aspirationsSpeaking from the Maryland state capital, Annapolis, he is prepared for the inevitable question about his political aspirations. “I’ve got an important job until January 2023,” he says, in reference to the end of his second and final term as governor.“I don’t think there is time to look ahead to what happens after that but there will be plenty of time to think about it. I’m not really making long-term plans about what happens in 2024.”In the meantime, his immediate concern is the potential impact of Trump on November’s elections.“As a Republican I am concerned. I think at the moment the Republican Party has got some real issues and could face a very difficult time in November. I think that translates down ballot – everybody’s focused on the presidential race, but that drag is going to hurt Senate, congressional races and some governor races.”The problem, he says, is Trump and his isive brand of politics. He cites the midterm elections of 2018 when Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives, some gubernatorial races and state legislative bodies across the country. “I think this November could be even worse,” he says.Hogan’s faith in a post-Trump future for the Republican Party is rooted in his own deep commitment to Republican politics.Despite his self-characterisation as something of a political outsider and self-made man – he ran a property business before running for political office –\u0026nbsphe comes from solid Republican stock.His father and namesake, Larry Hogan snr, was a senator who famously broke with his party in withdrawing his support for Richard Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal. A member of the House judiciary committee, his declaration that “not even the president” is above the law was streamed on television screens across the land.Party loyaltyWhile history may have judged him well, he paid a price politically. Hogan recalls his father receiving thousands of letters and offensive packages from Republicans furious at his perceived lack of party loyalty. He went on to lose the Republican primary in the governor’s race in 1974.Comparisons between father and son have surfaced as Larry Hogan jnr has taken a stance against Trump, particularly during the president’s impeachment.But his belief in a less isive Republicanism that is based on compromise with Democrats is also born of his own political experience.Hogan is one of a handful of Republican governors in a Democratic-majority state. Maryland, the east coast state which s the suburbs of greater Washington DC, the gritty urban centre of Baltimore and the genteel state capital of Annapolis, is traditional Democratic territory.His victory in 2014 – which saw him succeed another Irish-American, Martin O’Malley, a former Democratic candidate for president – was one of the political surprises of that election cycle. The political analysis website FiveThirtyEight gave his opponent Anthony Brown a 94 per cent chance of winning. But Hogan won decisively and secured re-election in 2018.Within the first few months of his election, he was plunged into a major crisis when the city of Baltimore erupted over the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered fatal injuries while being transported in the back of a police van. No one was ever charged with his death, and the city was the scene of violent clashes between police and the community.Hogan recounts in his book his clash with the Democratic mayor of the time, who he says was too late to call for state help. He is also critical of then president Barack Obama, who he claims warned him against sending in the National Guard.What is his view of the unrest happening today in the United States?‘Destructive mobs’“I think now many of our mayors and our governors are making the mistake of allowing destructive mobs to take over their cities without taking any action,” he says, a reminder that while political centrists like Hogan may seem moderate compared to Trump, he is still very much a Republican politician, with set views on law and order.When I ask him about the continuing high rates of crime in cities such as Baltimore, he blames federal agencies and prosecutors for not pursuing prosecutions.As for Donald Trump’s controversial decision to send in federal troops over the wishes of local officials in cities such as Portland and Seattle, he says: “he shouldn’t have to”, citing the failures further down the line. “You have to find a balance,” he adds, citing the need to avoid inflaming a situation or act aggressively against protesters.As regards November’s election, he refuses to be drawn on whether he will vote for Trump. He knows Joe Biden from the former vice-president’s time in the White House. But he is loyal enough to his party so that he is unwilling to cut the Democratic frontrunner much slack.“I think he’s a nice enough man,” he says of Biden. “I’m not sure that either party really has the absolute best candidate they can nominate. A lot of people in America are wondering if this the best we can do, are these the best choices to lead the country?”While Hogan doesn’t explicitly suggest that he could be the person to lead the country, he is crystal clear about his own political philosophy. He cites Ronald Reagan as a political hero, noting that his first experience in Republican politics was as the chairman of the Youth for Reagan group.“We need to get back to those times. Reagan had a more hopeful, more positive vision. It was all about civility, reaching across the aisle, working with Democrats and coming up with common sense solutions.” Reagan also successfully broadened the appeal of the Republican Party, Hogan says, attracting the so-called “Reagan Democrats” and independents.“Now we’re doing a lot more iding. We’re shrinking the base of the party,” he reflects, adding that Trump would be much more successful “if he threw his phone away and stopped tweeting”.“The Republican Party needs to be standing up for its allies, and focusing on the core issues like the economy,” he says. “If we try and get away from the demeaning, isive insults, I think we’ll be a lot more successful.”Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden buries hatchet looks bring kamala harris running mate","story":"On Friday night, supporters of Joe Biden received an urgent message from his campaign email address. But it wasn’t from the Democrat presidential nominee. It was from Kamala Harris.Underneath a picture of herself, the California senator wrote: “I know Joe’s heart, and I’ve seen first-hand his compassion and dedication to public service. He’ll be a president for all of us, and I’m giving everything I’ve got to help him succeed this year.”It was a further signal, if one were needed, that Ms Harris, 55, is now a clear favourite to become Mr Biden’s running mate. He has said he will make a decision next week. But the message was also clearly intended to defuse a vicious behind-the-scenes battle that has reached fever pitch in recent days.With so much on the line, the knives have been out for Ms Harris within the Democratic party. Anonymous briefings, some emanating from people in 77-year-old Mr Biden’s own camp, have attempted to portray her as disloyal, ruthlessly ambitious, opportunistic, untrustworthy and intent on becoming president herself.Read more: Who will be Joe Biden\u0027s running mate? The runners and ridersSimultaneously, some Democrats have been furiously talking up the chances of other candidates including Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s former national security adviser, congresswoman Karen Bass, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and senator Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran. Much of the internal doubt over Ms Harris goes back to the verbal attacks on Mr Biden she gave when campaigning for the presidential nomination.During a televised Democrat debate a year ago, and despite having been close to his late son Beau, Ms Harris unleashed on Mr Biden.She accused him of having opposed “busing”, a policy from the Seventies that was used to desegregate education by transporting black children to mostly white schools.Ms Harris said she, as a young black girl, had benefited from the policy, but Mr Biden had joined with segregationist senators in an attempt to stop it.Mr Biden was visibly stunned. “I thought we were friends...” he said later. Observers wondered whether the pair would ever speak again. Nevertheless, Ms Harris has been in pole position to be Mr Biden’s running mate for some time.When a photographer caught sight of Mr Biden’s handwritten speaking notes (below) at an event this week, the top entry was “Kamala Harris – do not hold grudges”.Ms Harris would be the first black woman to become a vice-presidential nominee. She is the daughter of academics who immigrated to America. Her Jamaican-born father is a Stanford University economist, and her mother was a Tamil cancer research scientist.After studying at the predominantly black Howard University, in Washington, she became a prosecutor, rising to be the first female, and first black, attorney general of California.Ironically, her decades as a prosecutor may appeal to Republican voters she has been accused by some Democrats of “keeping innocent people on death row”, despite her personal opposition to capital punishment.She also once threatened to prosecute parents if their children did not go to school.Ms Harris has been a rising star in the Democrat firmament for some time. In 2013, Barack Obama said of her: “She is brilliant and she is dedicated, and she is tough. She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country.”The comment ignited a brief political firestorm in which the president was widely accused of sexism. Mr Obama called his friend to apologise. As a senator sitting on the senate committee investigating Russian election interference, she criticised Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump’s attorney general, live on television, and then targeted Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee.Mr Trump called her “nasty”. Democrats called her the “female Obama”.Ms Harris then entered the Democrat presidential race to great fanfare, on Martin Luther King Jr day, in January. However, her campaign failed to catch fire. After the initial ambush on Mr Biden, several debate performances fell flat, money dried up and poll numbers plummeted.Ideologically, Ms Harris did not appeal to the more Left-wing activist base of the party that supported Bernie Sanders. Her centrist background – and scandal-free personal life, means she is the candidate Republicans may fear most. Ms Rice and Mr Biden worked closely together in the Obama administration. And Ms Bass is seen as a consensus candidate, who would not overshadow Mr Biden.He will speak to each candidate inidually next week. Whoever he picks will have their key campaign moment in the vice-presidential debate.On Friday, Ms Harris rounded on those criticising her. Speaking at a virtual conference for young black women, Ms Harris said her entire career she had been told to “wait her turn”, but she “eats ‘no’ for breakfast”.Urging listeners to embrace their “black girl magic”, she said: “There will be a resistance to your ambition. There will be people who say to you ‘You are out of your lane’.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cornwall beach locals pandemic masks benidorm steroids","story":"Holidaymakers in Malaga yesterday, playing by the rulesCoronavirus latest:  Shielded groups may get exclusive access to shops under new plans Can I visit Spain?

While 120 countries have now declared masks must be worn in public places, Dutch scientists say there is no evidence that they stop the spread of Covid-19 and the government has no plans to make them mandatory.Coen Berends, spokesman for the Holland’s National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, said: Face masks in public places are not necessary, based on all the current evidence. There is no benefit and there may even be a negative impact.Christian Hoebe, a professor of infectious diseases and government advisor, added:The evidence for them is contradictory. In general, we think you must be careful with face masks because they can give a false sense of security. People think they\u0027re immune from disease or stop social distancing. That is very negative.However, if you take a trip to the Netherlands this summer be sure to pack your mask as face coverings must still be worn on public transport.

Austria has done enviably well in controlling the pandemic, blessed with a citizenry that has stuck by rules clearly and consistently applied by a stern government: the result is that by reducing the programme to essentials, testing extensively, limiting venue capacity, and enforcing draconian guidelines, Salzburg has been able to open for business as not-quite-normal, allowing the world’s greatest musicians to perform for live audiences in three dimensions.  Austrian European affairs Minister Karoline Edtstadler at the launchExtra measures have been taken to manage the risks Read Christiansen\u0027s review of the debut performance, Elektra, here.Australia\u0027s state of Victoria declared a disaster today and imposed a nightly curfew for the capital Melbourne as part of its harshest movement restrictions to date to contain a resurgent Covid-19.Croatia has always been considered a safe destination, writes Jane Foster, and judging by the crowds in Split this summer, it still is.

Edinburgh Aiport has already said it will have to make about a third of its staff redundant, with bosses branding the current quarantine laws “unworkable”.The city\u0027s hotels group also maintains that Edinburgh it at a “huge disadvantage” compared with others in Europe because marketing has failed to recommence in order to entice tourists since the country reopened to visitors on June 10.Yesterday, Edinburgh Castle reopened for the first time since lockdown having been shut for the longest period since the Second World War.Read more: Why now is the perfect time to explore Britain\u0027s finest citiesThe World Health Organisation has urged countries not to reimpose national lockdowns in an attempt to stem the spread of Covid-19 due to the health, social and economic repercussions.In an exclusive interview with The  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, who helps lead the WHO’s pandemic response team as the head of the emerging diseases unit, said that countries should instead adopt localised strategies. By the end of March, as the coronavirus outbreak spiralled out of control across the globe, well over 100 countries had imposed a full or partial lockdown – affecting billions of people. Dr Van Kerkhove described these measures as a “blunt, sheer force instrument” that bought countries time to build the public health infrastructure needed to tackle Covid-19. Sarah Newey has the full story.Unmanageable beaches, chaotic parking, and overcrowded village – making social distancing impossible – are proving an unwelcome side effect of this summer’s staycation response to coronavirus, reports Patrick Sawer.Britain’s coastguards had their busiest day for more than four years on Friday, as the UK recorded its third hottest day ever.A body was found after a 15-year-old boy went missing in a lake close to Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock on Saturday, around the same time as a person was recovered from water near Porthcurno in Cornwall.Local authorities have warned that beaches are becoming unmanageable due to large numbers of visitors, raising fears around keeping people safe in the water.Read the full story here.Fistral Beach in Newquay on FridayThe Philippines today reported 5,032 additional coronavirus infections, its largest single-day increase on record, taking the country\u0027s case tally past 100,000.Confirming that recorded cases had reached 103,185, the country\u0027s Department of Health added that the Southeast Asian country\u0027s Covid-19 death toll had jumped by 20 to 2,059.President Rodrigo Duterte will today meet with his cabinet to discuss a call by front-line medical groups to put the capital city Manila, which accounts for the majority of the country\u0027s infections, back under a stricter lockdown.We\u0027ve been speaking to writers based in Cornwall this weekend, including our very own Jade Conroy,  Travel\u0027s Hotels and Guides Editor. Here\u0027s what she has to say:Watergate Bay – a popular surfing beach near Newquay – was thriving on account of the blue skies, but parking spaces were still to be found and you could just about maintain social distancing on the beach. Tables were also available at pizza restaurant Watchful Mary, which has a terrace above the sand from where you can observe the surfers.  The only place it wasn’t possible was on the narrow walkway and stairs leading down to the beach and the body boarding masses in the shallows. By 5pm, though, most of the crowds had gone home and we watched the sun start to set with just a few others.Treyarnon Beach and Harlyn Bay, also on the north coast (near Padstow), were decidedly less busy the day after, but possibly because of the grey and drizzly weather. 48 hours in. . .

Meanwhile, a testing regime to save millions of Britons’ overseas holidays will not be in place in time, the ex-Aviva chairman warned. Sir Adrian said:If we cut ourselves off from the important low-risk areas, we are going to suffocate the recovery of the aviation sector.

says lesbian kiss scene next step important inclusivity","story":"The BBC has defended its decision to air a lesbian kiss scene, saying it was an important part of their inclusivity message, following more than 100 complaints about the storyline.CBBC, The BBC children\u0027s network, was praised by many for its portrayal of on-screen ersity when two characters on the Canadian mockumentary drama The Next Step shared a romantic kiss in an episode two weeks ago.The scene saw Cleo and Jude embrace following a highly-charged duet when it became clear that their relationship was more than just platonic.Centred around the stories of a competitive dancing troupe training for various championships, the programme had not before featured such a kiss since it first aired seven years ago.In response to complaints that it was not appropriate for a young audience, The BBC said it was important to ensure all children were properly represented on its channels.Responding specifically to the objections about the same-sex kiss, the broadcaster said in a statement: This is an important part of our mission to make sure that every child feels like they belong, that they are safe, and that they can be who they want to be.We believe that the storyline, and the kiss, was handled with sensitivity and without sensationalism, following as it did the portrayal of Jude \u0026amp Cleo\u0027s developing relationship and I am afraid we do not agree that it was inappropriate for the audience age- CBBC regularly portrays heterosexual young people dating, falling in love, and kissing, and it is an important way of showing children what respectful, kind and loving relationships look like.The BBC also pointed out that the first time a same-sex kiss was shown in one of its children\u0027s series was on Byker Grove many years ago in 1994.In reference to more recent programmes, the statement added: Same-sex relationships have already featured in other CBBC shows such as Jamie Johnson, 4 O Clock Club, Dixie and Marrying Mum and Dad.Despite courting some criticism, the episode has been widely applauded on social media for increasing LGBTQ+ representation on-screen.More from NewsMore

of silver civil war coins he had discovered for fear that “nighthawks” would steal the trove if he went home.Luke Mahoney, 40, was scouring for precious metals near the Lindsey Rose Pub, in Ipswich, Suffolk, with his two friends last Sunday morning when he found a “beautiful” gold coin and a sixpence on the field.The group took a break for lunch and returned to the site to find that a plough had cracked a clay earthenware pot buried 2ft beneath the ground.By the end of the afternoon, Mr Mahoney, who has been metal detecting for over a decade, was “delighted” to have helped unearth 1,078 silver, hammered coins, including some possibly dating back to the 15th century. “They were everywhere. It was pandemonium. After ten minutes of searching I hit this massive signal and I thought \u0027this is it\u0027. We dug and saw the pot. That feeling of scraping the dirt away and seeing the coins is indescribable,” he said.The coins were likely buried by a wealthy landowner who had gone off to fight in the English Civil War, according to valuation experts, who believe they will sell at auction for a minimum of £100,000.In order to protect the finds, Mr Mahoney has revealed how he spent two sleepless nights in his car on the field watching for “nighthawk” detectorists hoping to loot the coins under the cover of darkness.Nighthawks, the term for illegal metal detectorists, have previously targeted numerous historic sites, including the Brunton Turret section of Hadrians Wall in their search for ancient artefacts.Mr Mahoney feared the treasures he discovered would be sold onto the black market by unscrupulous dealers who would use the history of the coins to boost their prices online.He told The Daily : “I had to stay up because I didn\u0027t want other people going into the fields and stealing the coins. I was getting an hour nap here and there for around two nights in a row.” “These nighthawks are professional thieves who make their living by waiting for detectorists to leave the fields and scavenge anything that is left over.” His anxieties seemed to be validated a few days ago when he found a casing from a headphone in the field, indicating someone had sneaked in to search for any remnants of the hoard.Despite the threat from “nighthawks”, Mr Mahoney, who owns Joan Allen Electrics, a metal detecting shop in Kent, is encouraging more people to take up his beloved hobby.He credits his success to the “unique” metal detector he was using, the Minelab Equinox 800, and thanks the owner of the Lindsey Rose Pub for allowing him to search around the premises.Following the discovery of his “biggest hoard”, Mr Mahoney immediately contacted the local finds liaison officer, who is currently assessing the coins, and declared the treasure to the coroner.“I want the coins to go to a local museum and the money from their sale as a little something for me and my two friends, Dan Hunt and Matt Brown, who found them with me,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel latest virus free italy pleads return british tourists","story":"The majority of Europeans would rather cancel a trip than be forced to wear face masks outsideCan I visit Spain?

This comes after Germany this week imposed a mandatory Covid-19 test for travellers arriving from 130 countries.Half of French respondents said they would rather cancel than test, and the same percentage would call off a trip if they had to wear a mask outdoors.Many European destinations have rolled out compulsory mask-wearing in public.

We paid £636 for a two-night stay checking in on April 8. Secret Escapes’ booking terms said that the reservation was non-­refundable if we cancelled.In the event we didn’t cancel ourselves, but the hotel was closed due to the coronavirus lockdown so we couldn’t stay. The Oxford Thames ­Hotel’s reservations manager said he could not process a refund and advised us to contact Secret Escapes to seek reimbursement. But Secret Escapes continues to insist that it does not have to repay us because of the “no refunds” clause in its terms and that the reason for the cancellation is immaterial. Surely this can’t be right: to take money for a service that cannot be provided? Read our consumer expert Gill Charlton\u0027s advice.Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, said:It is a decision of the British authorities, but we have given them all the arguments so that they can trust that their tourists are safe in Spanish destinations.If it is not the decision we expect, we will continue working with them.For us, the best news is to have the destination open with the United Kingdom, which is our main issuing market.We have the best protocols and are highly valued by the tourists themselves, who have transferred to their government that they feel safe in Spain. The list of destinations includes a number of popular spots in Italy, France and Turkey.Lyon and Bordeaux in France, plus Bodrum in Turkey, feature on the list, alongside long-haul destinations like Antigua.British Airways said the routes would be operated on low frequencies due to the ongoing impact of Covid-19.Italy is desperate for the return of British holidaymakers and has proclaimed itself as “up and running again” as a travel destination. The comments by the country’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, come as fears grow of a second wave of coronavirus infections across Europe. “Britons who decide to spend their holiday in Italy will find not just the beautiful country that we all know but the enthusiasm and energy of a people who are getting going again after living through a dramatic period,” he told the Times. “British citizens visiting Italy will find a safe country because the epidemiological situation is under control.”Italy was the first European epicentre of the coronavirus and initially criticised for its handling of the pandemic, but now it has one of the lowest infection rates on the Continent, less than half that of the UK.Last month Carolyn Spinks, chief operation officer of Abtoi, the Association of British Tour Operators to Italy, told  Travel the country faces economic disaster without tourism.

Not only is it on the FCO “safe” list of destinations that don’t require self-isolation on return, but Covid-19 numbers have been remarkably low. Granted, this is a small country with a population of fewer than nine million, but cases have ­totalled around 35,000 to date (compared to the UK’s 300,000) and deaths have remained below 10 per day for the past three months.For plenty of other reasons, a trip to Switzerland seems like the ideal antidote to lockdown. From walking to picnicking and from swimming to cycling, it is almost laughably easy to enjoy the great outdoors here. Even in town, there is open air – most places have a lake, pool or swimming baths ­complete with a wooden scaffold of stepped ing platforms, from low-slung to ear-popping, and somewhere good to eat and drink nearby.Read her love letter to Switzerland.Away from coronavirus, firefighters are tackling a blaze in the mountains east of Los Angeles. Evacuation orders remained in place early on Monday for thousands of people after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size and forced crews to battle flames in triple-digit heat.The Apple Fire in Riverside County consumed more than 31 square miles of dry brush and timber, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.As of Monday morning, it was five per cent contained. The cause was under investigation.The blaze began on Friday as two adjacent fires in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont about 85 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.Lufthansa is to resume services to Germany from Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The airline said from today it will restart a daily flight from the Midlands to Munich. It said: With flights arriving in under two hours, holidaymakers can take advantage of the short hop to Bavaria’s capital and enjoy the art museums, Neo-Gothic landmarks, such as the popular Neues Rathaus (town hall) with its daily glockenspiel show, or head further afield to visit the famous 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle.The German flag carrier says it is now operating 198 weekly flights from the UK and Ireland to nine hubs across Europe. Mart Stratton has had the summer holiday we all want. Look right when entering Katapolo Bay and you will see Erato, Zeus’s muse, lyre pressed against her chest, her marbled gaze, faraway. She may be reflecting upon the indignity of her fate. Her unloved statue was removed from Athens in 1937 and dispatched three decades later to Amorgos, the Cyclades’ easternmost island.Or perhaps she is musing over why this summer’s ferries look so desperately empty? She’s not to know, of course, that Greece has reduced ferry capacities as part of social distancing measures and international travellers are significantly down throughout the Cyclades. Neither too, anything about coronavirus.

However, from August 11, incoming travellers and residents arriving from certain countries will be allowed to self-isolate in a private residence for 14 days so long as they wear the device.Anyone arriving from Australia (excluding Victoria), New Zealand, Brunei, Macao, mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam can serve their stay home notice at a place of residence. Everyone else has to isolate at a state-appointed facility, at their own expense if they are not a Singaporean citizen or permanent resident.The monitoring system is similar to an electronic band rolled out in Hong Kong in March to ensure arriving passengers were following quarantine guidelines. South Korea has also introduced a wristband connected to a smartphone app, to detect those who are violating quarantine rules.Details on how exactly the device will work are still to be announced, although it will only be mandatory for those aged 12 and over.Read the full story. Delta has boasted it is the only airline operating between London and New York that keeps its middle seats empty to enable some sort of social distancing in the sky.The American carrier has today resumed its daily service between Heathrow and JFK and says it will keep capacity on its aircraft capped until the end of September to help protect the health and safety of its customers and crew.Seat blocks will be automatically implemented to prevent the adjacent seat being booked once a reservation is complete and seats are chosen, the airline said. Parties of three or more will be able to book seats together, including middle seats.Passengers and cabin crew will also be expected to wear face masks while travelling. The majority of airlines have rejected the idea of blocking the middle seat as it would prove economically damaging. However, while demand remains low in the wake of the pandemic, passengers on some carriers will find it easier than others to maintain social distance. A couple wear facemasks as the sun sets in New YorkAnd here is some more detail from my colleague, Ben Parker, on yet another coronavirus outbreak on a cruise ship.A cruise ship in the South Pacific has been forced to return to shore after a case of coronavirus was confirmed on board.Paul Gauguin Cruises’ eponymous vessel, the sole ship in its fleet, only resumed holidays on June 29 following an industry-wide pause in operations. The vessel began its current voyage in Papeete, capital of French Polynesia, with around 350 on board – including passengers and crew – and was sailing between Bora Bora and the Rangiroa islands when an on-board doctor diagnosed Covid-19. It has now returned to Tahiti, and  Travel understands the affected passenger has been taken ashore along with their family. Local media reports that the positive case is an American tourist, and that her family have tested negative.There are a number of measures in place on the ship to thwart the spread of Covid-19, including a reduction in capacity and the removal of buffet meals. At embarkation, all passengers who have been in the country for less than two weeks are required to produce a negative Covid-19 test as well as undergo a health check on board. The cruise line, which is a subsidiary of French operator Ponant, has been contacted for comment.The news is a further blow to the beleaguered cruise industry and comes after at least 40 passengers and crew who had been on board MS Roald Amundsen in Norway tested positive for the virus. Of the ship’s 158 staff, 36 are infected. Read the fully story. Global airline capacity has crept above 50 per cent for the first time since the pandemic, new figures show, fuelling optimism that the world\u0027s travel industry could be set for a recovery.John Grant, an analyst at OAG, said scheduled passenger seats was now up to 60 million, up 4 per cent on last week, and now 50.4 per cent of last year\u0027s capacity. There are undoubtedly some markets where capacity is returning to previous year levels and others where further growth remains out of reach pending lockdowns being eased, he said. The United Kingdom reported the largest weekly capacity increase amongst the top ten countries with a near 20 per cent increase and some 230,000 additional seats added. Easyjet added a further 115,000 seats to their network of which 20,000 were to Spain (that may now be changing!) and both Greece and France had seen a further 12,000 seats added.He said that there are currently 638 airlines operating around the world, down from 716 last year.Given the market conditions and outlook for the coming months it is likely that many of those will be probably not be operating again in the near future, he said. The latest tourist statistics for Portugal have been released by the country\u0027s Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE).The number of overnight stays by foreign tourists in June fell 96 per cent compared to last year, the INE said.Portugal remains off the UK Foreign Offices list of \u0027safe\u0027 countries, heavily restricting the number of British holidaymakers making the trip. Beach resorts in Portugal are all-but emptyThe Cavendish hotel in the heart of Mayfair, London, reopened over the weekend. See here for the latest information on all the best hotels in the UK that have now reopened their doors once again. Up to 30 people can now meet outside in Wales while maintaining social distancing, with pubs and restaurants in the country able to open indoors.Children under the age of 11 no longer need to keep two metres from each other or adults, following scientific evidence that the risk of transmission is lower among that age group.Changes to coronavirus regulations in Wales on Monday also include pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes being able to reopen indoors as well as bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls.Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to provide wedding ceremonies - though indoor receptions are still banned.On Sunday, Public Health Wales said that a further three deaths had been reported, taking its total for Wales to 1,565 deaths. A further 37 positive cases were recorded, bringing the total figure in Wales to 17,315.Follow the latest on the coronavirus on our live blog here. Hurtigruten has suspended all of its expedition cruises after a coronavirus outbreak on one of its ships.All guests on board MS Roald Amundsen have been told to quarantine after 36 crew members of several guests tested positive for Covid-19. The line has now said all its sailings will be cancelled until further notice. In light of the recent increase in new cases of Covid-19 globally, the only responsible choice is to suspend all expedition sailings until we are absolutely confident, we can carry out our operations in line with all requirements from the Authorities and with the even stricter requirements we have set for ourselves.Hurtigruten is as of Monday in the process of reaching out to and informing guests booked on the now cancelled voyages.The staff, of which there were 160 in total, were tested at the end of a seven-day sailing around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard on Friday, with 177 passengers on board none of whom reported any symptoms of the virus while onboard and all of whom had disembarked by the time the news broke.The Australian city of Melbourne has been plunged into further lockdown to stem the tide of new coronavirus cases. Melbourne now finds itself back at square one, with a harsher Stage 4 lockdown now underway. How does this feel exactly? Like hearing ‘False start!’ three-quarters through a Tough Mudder trail.Expected to last a minimum of six weeks, Australia’s toughest restrictions to date include a nightly curfew between 8pm and 5am for those not at work, three-mile restrictions for all shopping and exercising, and the expected closure of non-essential retail outlets. Rumours of abattoir shutdowns have switched-up the panic buying from toilet rolls to mince.The biggest driver of Melbourne’s new infections are symptomatic locals heading out instead of staying home. On July 30, a doorknock by teams of Australian Defence Force and Department of Health and Human Services officers found that more than a quarter of residents who had tested positive for Covid-19 weren’t home. Many have been at work, sparking Covid-19 hotspots that now include over 60 aged-care facilities.Then there are those simply too bored or defiant to follow the rules, among them a ban on non-essential trips outside the metropolitan area. This particular no-no didn’t stop one man from zipping up to the New South Wales border (a distance of 199 miles) to buy a Big Mac. Daily appeals from Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to ‘stay home’ recall a patient parent tested by misguided teens.Read the full story. Thousands of Chinese beer lovers left their facemasks and virus worries behind to gather in large crowds and raise a much-needed glass as the annual Qingdao beer festival opened over the weekend.China has largely brought the coronavirus outbreak under control through a series of lockdowns and restrictions, and the small number of cases reassured beer-lovers to turn out despite the global pandemic.And at the festival, which opened Friday and runs until late August, drinkers were eating and drinking together, watching shows and fireworks and sampling the more than 1,500 types of beer available.Many revellers were walking around the enormous venue in Shandong province mask-free, with long tables packed with merry drinkers in scenes reminiscent of pre-COVID-19 days.State broadcaster CCTV said the festival was a chance for people to go back to normal life and clink glasses.The annual Qingdao Beer Festival in Qingdao, in China\u0026#39s eastern Shandong provinceIt\u0027s been half a year since I last travelled around... I feel so happy and relaxed right now, Wang Hua, a tourist from northern Shanxi Province, told CCTV. But all was not entirely as normal.The central Beer City is limited to 30 percent visitor capacity, while staff must wear masks and visitor temperatures and health codes are checked.Imported beer containers are also being tested for the virus and disinfected before entering the venue, officials said, after several local clusters in China were linked to imported food.Japan is seeing a resurgence in virus cases but a pressure remains to keep the economy movingPeople wearing protective face masks rest at socially distancing sitting area in TokyoRevised GDP figures in Japan show a country already in recession before the pandemic hitGermany planning to ramp up its testing of arrivals from overseas. Reuters has the latest:Mandatory testing of travellers returning to Germany from countries with a high risk of COVID-19 infection will take effect later this week, Health Minister Jens Spahn said.We have first drafts. We want to coordinate this well with the states because they need to be able to implement it at airports and train stations, he told German broadcaster ARD on Monday.The country has seen a small uptick in the number of new daily cases, with 1,012 recorded on July 31, the first time in more than a month the figure surpassed 1,000. Healthy restaurant bookings are due to people having spare money from staycations rather than the launch of \u0027Eat Out to Help Out\u0027, the San Carlo group has said. Managing Director Marcello Distefano has said that people who would have spent money going abroad are instead using the extra cash to eat out at restaurants. Discussing the Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme he told BBC Radio 4’s The Today Programme: “We had a positive response to our social media last week. We started advertising throughout Thursday and Friday and the bookings are looking quite healthy for this week.“But we are also putting it down to the fact that  we believe there’s a lot of people who are not going on holiday, everyone is calling it a staycation at the moment.”He added that the rise in bookings was not “purely to do with” the Government scheme but instead “people still have some money to spend, they’re not going away but they still want to eat out”. Good morning, here are some of the weekend\u0027s key stories:Victoria declares disaster and sets curfew for Melbourne UK staycations attract large crowds and increase coastguard calloutsSwitzerland and Ireland consider enforcing stricter Covid-19 restrictionsHolland’s top scientists say no to face masks in public placesCoronavirus latest news: Reopening schools without better test and trace \u0026#39threatens second wave twice as big as first\u0026#39Donald Trump threatens to sue Nevada to stop mail-in ballotsProsecutor seeking Donald Trump\u0026#39s tax returns cites public allegations about his businessesRobot burglars that enter homes through cat flaps, new threat to homeownersGCSE English literature exam students to get choice of topics because of school closuresAustralian city shuts non-vital businesses to curb coronavirus spreadDonald Trump wants \u0026#39substantial money\u0026#39 for US government in TikTok sale to MicrosoftWatch: Captain Sir Tom Moore becomes honorary colonel of Harrogate army training centreGovernment tells firms to stockpile medicines for end of Brexit transitionDisposable PPE can be converted into fuel rather than being sent to landfill, review findsRise in cases of health anxiety triggered by coronavirus, study findsGauguin and the Impressionists review, Royal Academy: the dazzling spoils of a very canny collectorReopening schools without better test and trace \u0026#39threatens second wave twice as big as first\u0026#39First case of bone cancer discovered in dinosaurs, scientists claimStatins have limited positive impact on risk of early death, study findsNo 10 hints that pubs could close to keep schools open in local outbreaksHomeowners offered up to £10,000 for energy efficiency changes as Government seeks \u0026#39green recovery\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge reveals Red Cross nurse past of her grandmotherIntegration could reduce tensions between Muslim and Jewish communities, study showsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"workers have go office resent staying home experts say","story":"Workers who have continued to come into the office during the coronavirus pandemic resent their colleagues who work from home and some are being offered extra pay or perks, HR professionals have said.Those who feel that they have taken on extra responsibilities as others work from home or are furloughed have even resorted to launching grievance procedures against their employers, it has emerged.The anger of their colleagues has even seen some furloughed workers asked to return early, it is understood. On the first working day that employers in England can demand their staff return to the office, it was said that bosses have also seen “push back” from those on the other side of the ide who are refusing to return.Katie Jacobs, Senior Stakeholder Lead at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said that the workplace has been “fractured” by different experiences of the pandemic and bosses are looking for ways to bring back workers both physically and psychologically. “At the beginning the attitude was ‘we are all in this together’ but as time goes on that has dissipated,” she told the .“At the beginning employers were pleasantly surprised that there was a lot of kindness, but that seems to have disappeared and now people are tired, burnt out and fed up. Anecdotally I would say that we are seeing a bit of resentment.“At the beginning there was quite a lot of talk around danger money for front line workers and whether they should be rewarded with extra stuff.“Some employers have paid bonuses or given extra perks like a few days holiday to differentiate those still going in to work.”From August 1 the Government guidance changed meaning employers can now ask employees to return to their workplace so long as they have Covid-19 safety measures in place.But Ms Jacobs estimates that in offices only around 20-30 per cent of the workforce will be expected to come back before the autumn or the end of the year.“There has been some push back from people who are still anxious about returning to the office and even some people not wanting to come back from furlough,” she said.The CIPD are advising employers that there is “no clear reason for a rush to return to work” and bosses should only ask employees to come back if it is essential, safe and mutually agreed.Alan Price, CEO of BrightHR which provides HR support for 33,000 small and medium businesses, said most are not yet requiring all their employees to return, largely due to social distancing measures and to childcare concerns.Mr Price said that for smaller businesses September, when children return to school, will be the “watershed moment”.Many of those working from home are beginning to argue that there has not been a big drop in productivity, and they are spending more time working as they are not having to commute.Since the start of the pandemic BrightHR has recorded a 50 per cent reduction in sickness and a 75 per cent reduction in lateness.But some employers who had asked their workers to return on Monday morning had found that they had not shown up to work but had logged on at home as they had been doing throughout the pandemic.  Mr Price said: “Some employees have pointed out that their contract says that their place of work can be altered, but employers have rightly said that they can alter it but the employee can’t do it themselves. It is the employer who has the control over that.”Some bosses, particularly in small businesses, argue that they cannot give staff the range of tasks or communicate effectively when people are at home, Mr Price said.Ms Jacobs added that employers had reported people refusing to return to the office or come back from furlough with some having even left the city or the country during lockdown.But what is emerging is an “us and them” ision between those who had been furloughed or not and those who were attending work or working from home, Mr Price said.“We have seen grievances from people who have had to go in to work. We have seen some complaints about the fact that their colleagues have no travel time or travel costs and they do,” he pointed out.Under the new rules employees have to return to work if you have been told to do so, unless you can prove your employer is not complying with Covid-secure measures.Ruby Dinsmore, an employment solicitor from Slater and Gordon, said: As an employee you must comply with a reasonable management request.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/30/12/nasa-launch.jpg","title":"california earthquake nasa space agency mars launch rocket 2020 today","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The earthquake has not caused a delay to the launchNasa\u0027s facilities have been hit by an earthquake in California as it prepares for its mission to Mars.The earthquake, which took place only one mile from San Fernando in California, does not appear to have caused any delay to the launch, which is happening on the other coast of the US, in Florida.But facilities that will be key to the launch, including Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory – which is based in California – were affected by the 4.5 magnitude earthquake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt hit while reporters were interviewing engineer and project manager MiMi Aung about the helicopter that is set to be released by the Perseverance rover once it lands on Mars.The Martian atmosphere is 99 percent less dense than on Mars, and the gravity is 38 percent weaker, which makes flying a helicopter a particularly challenging task. Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Buzzfeed report quoted 10 workers who came forward to describe the alleged “toxic” work environment and make accusations against specific producers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDeGeneres, who was not personally accused of mistreating staff, issued an apology to staff and said she took “full responsibility”, as her name is the show’s brand. “I told everyone in our first meeting that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place of happiness – no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect,” she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Radio executive claims he was ‘told not to look at’ Ellen DegeneresEllen DeGeneres breaks silence over claims of toxic show environment“Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.”De Rossi has since encouraged her followers to “be kind to one another”, as more people come forward to detail their experiences with DeGeneres.Sharing a poster that reads, “I stand by Ellen”, she added in the caption: “To all our fans… we see you.  #stopbotattacks. #IStandWithEllenDeGeneres #IStandByEllen #IstandByEllenDeGeneres.”Everybody Loves Raymond star Brad Garrett recently claimed he knew “more than one person” who had been mistreated on The Ellen Show. “Sorry but it comes from the top @TheEllenShow,” he tweeted. “Know more than one who were treated horribly by her. Common knowledge.”On Sunday 2 August, an Australian radio host alleged that DeGeneres’s team had instructed him not to look at her during an interview on the Today show, which he executive produced at the time.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8.

When astronomers first looked at RU Lupi\u0027s collection of dust, it looked the same, with a relatively neat organisation that appeared to be forming new worlds.But studies of the gas rather than the dust in the disc that surrounds it appears to show that the process of forming those planets is much more complex, and less neatly arranged, than previously thought. The complicated web of gas looks something like a miniature galaxy, researchers said.Scientists find \u0027lost\u0027 planet in breakthroughAstronomers were encouraged to look at the gas rather than the dust after they noticed hints of carbon monoxide, or CO, extending beyond the disc. When they re-examined it, they spotted the spiralling structures of gas – which makes up much more of such a protoplanetary disc than dust does.“We discovered a complex set of spiral arms in carbon monoxide (CO) emission extending to nearly 1,000 astronomical units from the young star RU Lup, which has previously been found to exhibit signs of ongoing planet formation via concentric dust gaps in its protoplanetary disk,” said Jane Huang, who led the research, in a statement.“CO emission reveals complex structures in the planet-formation environment that are invisible in dust observations alone.”Usually, the discs that surround a star and give rise to new worlds are shown in neat, swirling circles around their sun. But the new study suggests there are other kinds of planet-forming environments that could be much messier than those images might suggest, the authors said.“The planet-forming environment can be much more complex and chaotic than implied by the numerous, well-known images of concentric ringed protoplanetary disks mapped in millimeter continuum emission,” said Huang.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

We may have missed much of the gas structures in other disks.”Researchers have proposed a range of possibilities to explain both the unusual structures and the strange behaviour of the star: that the disc is so massive it is collapsing under its own gravity, that it is interacting with another star, or that interstellar material is being pulled along the arms. But those explanations are incomplete and scientists now hope to find more of the unusual planet factories to understand the processes behind the formation better.“None of these scenarios completely explain what we have observed,” said Sean Andrews, who worked on the study alongside Huang at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard \u0026amp Smithsonian.“There might be unknown processes happening during planet formation that we have not yet accounted for in our models. We will only learn what they are if we find other disks out there that look like RU Lup.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The item’s manufacturer, a firm in Guangzhou, laid the blame on a bug in translation software, while stating it had intended for the text to say “dark brown”.In 2017 another Chinese third-party seller used the same phrase to refer to the name of a wig-base cap sold on Walmart, forcing the US firm to issue an apology.An Amazon spokesperson said: “All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.”Racial equality review is ‘written on back of fag packet’, says LammyThe MP in turn thanked the firm for their actions, however he asked Amazon to detail what systems they had in place “for reviewing descriptions and not allowing offensive terms to be posted in the first place?”. He added: “This is not the first time.”It comes just hours after Mr Lammy called on Twitter to be “much faster at removing hate” after a delay in removing alleged racist abuse targeted at him.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have policies in place that address abuse and harassment, violent threats, and hateful conduct.“If we identify accounts that violate any of these rules, we’ll take enforcement action.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The reopening of schools in September must be accompanied by a high-coverage test-trace-isolate (TTI) programme if the country is to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections, a study has suggested.Researchers analysed data from the first wave of Covid-19 and modelled the potential impact of schools in Britain reopening in less than a month to understand how the virus can be kept under control.The study, published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health, simulated various scenarios to examine the possible consequences of schools reopening in tandem with parents returning to their offices and increased socialising within the community.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that “with increased levels of testing… and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.A second study, also published in The Lancet, found low levels of transmissions in schools and nurseries where control measures are in place.Ministers still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMake face masks mandatory in secondary schools, teachers’ union urgesOldham is back in lockdown because test and trace is failingNHS test and trace reaching fewer close contacts of Covid-19 infectedTest-and-trace preferred to quarantine by most travellers, poll findsDr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, who lead the study, said: “Our modelling suggests that with a highly-effective test and trace strategy in place across the UK, it is possible for schools to reopen safely in September.“However, without sufficient coverage of a test-trace-isolate strategy, the UK risks a serious second epidemic peak either in December or February. Therefore, we urge the government to ensure that test-trace-isolate capacity is scaled-up to a sufficient level before schools reopen.”It comes after chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned the public may have to trade some liberties in order to secure others, to prevent losing control of the virus, and a member of the government’s Sage group suggested pubs and other venues may have to close in order for schools to reopen.Professor Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at LSHTM and senior author on the study, said the findings should “not be used to keep schools shut” but should be viewed as a “loud call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace system”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It all depends on the other measures and the level of TTI coverage,” he said, adding that at the present moment, TTI is “not achieving the levels that we modelled”.“Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.“It looks from the ONS data like there are about 4,200 new infections per day. And it looks like from the testing data there are about 4,200 testing positive per week. So it looks like about one in seven. So, that’s not good enough, basically,” added Mr Bonnell.The researchers cautioned that the level of infectiousness in children compared to adults in non-conclusive. The main study used a model that assumed children were as infectious as adults, and they re-ran the model with the assumption that children and young people were half as infectious as adults, with the results remaining the same.The second study looked at real-world data from January to April tracking the spread of coronavirus within 25 schools and nurseries in New South Wales, Australia.School closures will hit UK productivity for years, experts warnIt found that the risk of children and staff transmitting the virus in educational settings was “very low” when contact tracing and other virus control restrictions were in place.Commenting on both studies, Professor W John Edmunds from LSHTM, said: “Both studies give potential options for keeping schools open and show the clear importance of adequate contact tracing and testing.“We urgently need large-scale research programmes to carefully monitor the impact of schools reopening, as Public Health England’s sKID study aims to do. Only in this way can we take the most appropriate measures to mitigate the risks and allow us to reassure parents, pupils and teachers alike that schools are safe to attend.“There are no quick fixes to this terrible pandemic. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that governments around the world need to find solutions that allow children and young adults to return to full-time education as safely and as quickly as possible.”test and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If infections become more widespread elsewhere, the government would focus on restricting social contact than close down parts of the hospitality industry.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes after Professor Graham Medley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that pubs and other leisure venues may have to close in order to allow children to return to school in September.He said: “It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising.

It employs more than two million people, predominantly young people, and it’s important that we continue to support it.”Chief medical officer Chris Whitty previously warned that England was now “near the limit” of the restrictions which can be relaxed without losing control of the virus.19 people test positive for coronavirus in outbreak linked to pubHe said during a press conference over the weekend: “If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things.”His warning was echoed in newly-released minutes of a Sage meeting that said: “There may be a need to change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below 1 whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Hundreds of trafficking survivors have had their financial support slashed unlawfully during the coronavirus pandemic, lawyers warn.People recognised as potential victims of modern slavery who have been placed in hotels and other interim accommodation during lockdown stopped receiving their weekly government allowance – which is designed to aid their recovery – without warning last month.The Home Office is facing a legal challenge over its decision to cut their financial support, with lawyers stating that there is no legal basis for such practice as it places vulnerable people at risk of re-trafficking.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn one case seen by The Independent, a Kenyan woman  – believed to have been trafficked to the UK and held in a brothel where she was forced to have sex daily – has been unable to access essential toiletries including sanitary pads and toothpaste, nor top-up for her phone in order to contact her support worker and legal representatives.A number of victims, including this woman, have recently had their support reinstated after their lawyers challenged the inidual cases in court. The department is now facing a legal challenge to restore support for hundreds of other trafficking survivors who have been affected.Home Office cuts support for trafficking victims during pandemicHome Office relying on ‘flawed evidence’ to deport slavery victimsModern slavery referrals drop for first time in four yearsIniduals whom the government decides there are “reasonable grounds” to believe have been subjected to modern slavery enter a framework called the National referral Mechanism (NRM), under which they receive weekly subsistence of either £35 or £65 per week. Those who are also seeking asylum often live in asylum accommodation, but they continue to receive the same rates of financial support.During the coronavirus lockdown, a number of these iniduals were placed in hotels along with other asylum seekers, due to a shortage of accommodation. While there was initially no change to their support rates, in early July it was reduced to nothing, with no warning given to them or their lawyers, and no clear explanation as to why.The UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner Dame Sara Thornton wrote to safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins on Friday demanding clarity on the change to subsistence rates, and warning that it would “only further exacerbate the vulnerability of victims of modern slavery”.She stated in the letter that multiple organisations had contacted her office expressing “significant concerns” regarding the change, with some having to provide supermarket vouchers to survivors to enable them to meet their essential needs. She cited one case where a trafficking survivor had resorted to begging following their loss of financial support.“Whilst providing full-board emergency accommodation may meet a person’s essential living needs, it does not recognise their status as a potential victim of modern slavery,” Dame Sarah said in the letter.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This left her without access to essential toiletries including sanitary pads and toothpaste and unable to top up her phone, use public transport or access the internet.The woman, who has been diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder, was therefore unable to call her support worker, lawyer or friends who supported her, and could not attend medical or counselling appointments. The hotel at which she was accommodated didn’t provide toiletries other than tissues, there was no telephone access for external calls, and the hotel wifi cost £7 per day, according to her lawyer.Heather Malunga, immigration lawyer at the Immigration Advice Service, who represents the woman, said: “This financial support is intended to protect victims of trafficking and promote their recovery. The Home Office’s actions leave this very vulnerable group at risk of harm and even re-exploitation.“The government’s position is that they get toiletries in hotels, but most are not receiving basic essentials, so they have to buy their own. Clothing isn’t provided, neither are stamps or phone credit. They’re meant to be able to contact their support worker or counsellor when they’re feeling distressed, but they can’t because that money is no longer there.”The Home Office has been issued a pre-action letter from lawyers at Duncan Lewis Solicitors requesting that it reinstate financial support to all potential victims in hotel accommodation, after the law firm successfully challenged cuts to support for five iniduals, whose support was subsequently reinstated.Ahmed Aydeed, director of public law at the firm, said: “Instead of increasing basic support for victims of trafficking during this pandemic, the home secretary has unlawfully cut the basic subsistence payments made to them. Survivors of trafficking are entitled to this support and desperately need it to enable them to recover and escape from their traffickers.”He said the charities contracted by the Home Office to provide NRM support seemed to have been “forced into silence”, and that it had therefore been left to “courageous” survivors to challenge the cuts to ensure others weren’t left at an enhanced risk of being re-trafficked.Zoe Dexter, welfare and housing manager at the Helen Bamber Foundation, which supports at least seven clients who have lost their NRM support, said the charity was “extremely concerned” by the cuts.“We have seen people’s mental health deteriorate as a result of being in hotels with no choice about what they eat, where they go, if they have enough money on their phone to call a friend or their GP or therapist or access to the internet,” she said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pelicans interact with a visitor in St James\u0027s Park in LondonLewis Hamilton drives with a puncture towards the finish line to win the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone Arsenal\u0027s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates with the trophy and teammates after winning the FA Cup, as play resumes behind closed doors following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease People enjoy the sunny weather at a Bournemouth BeachAn artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

DHSC  has declined to comment on what legal basis the rules were currently being enforced.Meanwhile the mayor of London has hit out at the central government for not briefing him on alleged contingency plans to lockdown the entirety of the capital within the confines of the M25 motorway, which encircles the city.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In June a pharmaceutical industry memo said original stockpiles meant for no deal had been “used up entirely” and that it might not be possible to replenish them before December, when the UK is due to leave the single market.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoris Johnson refused to extend the Brexit transition period last month despite disruption caused by coronavirus and the fact the UK is facing a cliff edge at the end of the year. Flagging trade talks mean it is increasingly likely that Britain will leave the single market without any trade agreement at all, with disruption to trade and supply chains expected.Why you shouldn’t lose any sleep over a no-deal BrexitNorthern Ireland customs rules not settled six months after Brexit“Holding additional stock in the UK provides a further buffer against some disruption and we believe, where it’s possible, it’s a valuable part of a robust contingency plan,” the letter, signed by Steve Oldfield, chief commercial officer at the department of health and social care, says.“We recognise that global supply chains are under significant pressure, exacerbated by recent events with Covid-19. However, we encourage companies to make stockpiling a key part of contingency plans, and ask industry, where possible, to stockpile to a target level of six weeks’ total stock on UK soil. DHSC stands ready to support companies with their plans if required and understands that a flexible approach to preparedness may be required that considers a mixture of stockpiling and rerouting plans as necessary.”But the memo reported earlier in the year from the pharmaceutical industry warned that there would be “less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products” thanks to the pandemic.It continued: “We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.”Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My husband has a nice car, his business is to sell and buy cars, she told a Middlesbrough employment tribunal in April.All of us, even Polish families, were born in deep communism so people are jealous when we have something they ask why do I have this and why I work in a factory. This is hidden bullying, she said.The mother-of-one argued her Czech origins and the predominantly Polish background of the workforce was linked to historic tensions which influenced her experience at the factory. The former factory worker said she discovered excrement in her lunchbox and had her work shoes soaked in urine.She also said her coffee was spiked with laxatives forcing her to make several trips to the bathroom.Other incidents included finding alcohol planted in her locker and the claim that other workers had rummaged through her bag.Tribunal judge Tudor Garnon said that the culprit of the disgusting attacks remained a mystery.On one occasion, she claimed a Polish colleague Bogdan Piatek, , called her gypsy and made comments such as: Hey Czech, you’re here again  What do you want here  Don’t worry, you’re not going to be here long.She also claimed another colleague, Adam Cywinski, , made crude sexual jokes about the two of them and at one point inappropriately touched her breasts.The judge described Cywinski as obsessed with her in a fairly harmless, though persistent, way.He ruled that Ms Capandova was harassed while employed at Bfa, concluding: We accept somebody put excrement in her lunchbox, laxatives in her coffee, alcohol in her locker, urinated in her boots and went through her bag. These were the acts of a person, probably more than one person, which had a profound effect upon [Mrs Capandova] and understandably so. She cannot say, nor can we tell, who did it, still less why.The judge added that although her harassment claim was well-founded, Bfa could not be found liable to sex or race discrimination. For that reason, he said Bfa can only compensate for the injury caused by the acts which were proved as being harassment.A tribunal report released last month read: The unanimous decision of the Tribunal is the claims of harassment are well-founded to the extent described in the reasons, but the claims of direct discrimination are not.Unfortunately, its not the first time such disgusting acts have been reported on the job.Amazon was forced to apologise after a horried online shopper caught a delivery man pooing in her garden.The revolting clip, showing a man wearing a hi-vis jacket squatting behind a fence and then attempting to clean himself up, was captured by Rebekah Eleanor Read, from Swindon, Wiltshire, and posted to social media.And John Lewis was forced to apologise to a customer who claimed he was sent a poo in a courier package last month.Dan Rodgers, , received a package at his home in Workington, Cumbria from the department store on Friday evening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he remembers the date well because he took daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey.But Shukri has no doubts it was the Prince she saw dancing with teenage sex slave Virginia Giuffre at a nightclub — because she said sorry to him after standing on his foot.Shukri said she turned to apologise after her mishap on the dance floor at Tramp and found herself face-to-face with the Prince.She recalled: “He was smiling. He said, ‘No problem’.”Shukri’s account is another blow to the beleaguered royal, who has come under intense scrutiny since -year-old Maxwell was arrested last month for conspiring with Epstein to sex traffick women.Shukri today said she decided to speak out after watching Andrew’s denial during his now infamous Newsnight interview.She contacted US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents a number of Epstein’s victims. Ms Bloom passed the information on to the FBI.  Shukri said: “When I watched the BBC interview and saw Prince Andrew deny knowing Virginia, saying he has no recollection of that night I had to come forward.“Because I was there and I do have a recollection of it.”Shukri said that she and a male friend had been dancing in the club while Andrew was among a group sitting in a corner.She added: “I can remember exactly where they were sitting. “They had one of those coolers with ice and a bottle in. In fact probably two of those. “You could tell they were getting special treatment.“The man I was with went over there and started talking to them and then came back.“Then at some point I was dancing with him and stood on the feet of one of the men sitting in the corner and I said, ‘I’m sorry’.“And he was smiling. He said, ‘No problem’. My companion said that the man who I stood on was actually Prince Andrew.“I’d never seen a Prince in my le before. I just stood and looked at this man, thinking, ‘Oh my goodness. It’s a real Prince.’“He was smiling a lot, most of the night. “He looked like he was having a great time. And he was with this young girl who was close to my own age, perhaps even a bit younger than me.“They were not that alone. They were with the woman who has just been arrested, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Epstein. “I will never forget the night because I was told this is a real Prince. That’s the moment that stood out for me. I don’t think I would have remembered otherwise.”Shukri recalled Virginia had an “awkward expression” on her face.She added: “I do remember the little girl perhaps was a little bit drunk or just had a weird expression, an awkward expression.“But she wasn’t smiling, it was the opposite of smiles.”In Virginia’s account of the night of March , , Andrew was “sweating profusely” as they danced. Andrew told Newsnight that was impossible as he has a medical condition which means he does not sweat.Shukri says she cannot be sureAndrew was sweating — but claims she did see him wipe his face.She said: “He was using the back of his hand. I don’t know with all honestyhe was wiping it because he was sweating or just touching it.“But he wiped at his forehead with the back of his hand when he was dancing several times.“I remember he was dancing with the young girl and chatting with her throughout the night.”Virginia, now , says she was forced to have sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London house. She says a picture of Andrew with his arm around her was taken there on the same night.Andrew has said he has no ­recollection of meeting Virginia and suggested the photo may have been faked. Maxwell is currently in jail in New York awaiting trial.Billionaire financier Epstein, a friend of Andrew’s, killed himself in prison a year ago while facing similar charges.Somalian Shukri said she was even more determined to come ­forward because she was a sex trafficking victim herself.She was a teenage refugee from her war-torn homeland when she was trafficked from Kenya to Italy and then London. Ms Bloom believes Shukri to be a credible witness. The lawyer said: “All she wanted was to get her story to the FBI as a witness to help Virginia.“So she wasn’t seeking any money from anyone. She wasn’t looking to bring a lawsuit.”The FBI decided it did not need Shukri’s testimony.Ms Bloom said: “They said, ‘We have the story, thank you. And we don’t need to bother her’.”The lawyer said a second woman had been in touch claiming to have seen Andrew and Virginia together in the club on that evening.She said she had several phone conversations with the witness, who was too frightened to go public. Ms Bloom hopes Shukri’s story will put further pressure on Andrew to speak to US prosecutors. She said: “Absolutely they should investigate him.“You know,it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck and this duck spent a lot of time with Epstein,“And Andrew’s story always seemed so shady to me.“He has not released any documents, calendars or journals that would show where he was.”Andrew was pictured in Tramp on March  — three days after it is claimed he was there with Virginia.He was snapped chatting to Fiona Sangster, we of racing tycoon Robert.Virginia claims she was groomed by Epstein and Maxwell after being invited to apply for a masseuse job shortly after her th birthday.She has alleged in court documents they made her have sex with Andrew in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands in .Last week more of her allegations were revealed during ongoing ­hearings related to the trafficking charges against Maxwell.David Boies, Virginia’s lawyer, told The Sun last night: “The more the evidence comes out, the more confirmation there is that the Epstein survivors are telling the truth, and that the denials and attacks of the Epstein enablers and participants are a smokescreen.”Buckingham Palace has previously described Virginia’s claims as “ and without any foundation”.It added: “Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors” by the Duke of York was “categorically untrue”.Andrew, , has not commented on Shukri’s claims.But a friend said: “It’s interesting to see how many people have razor sharp recollections of events that took place some  years ago.“It’s dficult to believe that these events can be remembered with such clarity at this distance.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In its place, he urged governments to continue with containment measures such as contact tracing, quarantining and mass testing.Dr Tedros said: The message to people and governments is clear: Do it all.A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection.However, theres no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be.He added: There are concerns that we may not have a vaccine that may work, or its protection could be for just a few months, not more.But until we finish the clinical trials, we will not know.The WHO head said that, while the coronavirus was the biggest health emergency since the early th century, the international scramble for a vaccine was also unprecedented.Some of the worlds largest economies are locked into the race for a vaccine, with the likely contenders hailing from Oxford University as well as US-based firm Moderna.Oxford scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in their quest for a vaccine after discovering that the jab triggers a response that offers a double defence against the virus.The  reported that phase one of the vaccine has shown that it generates an immune response against the disease.Imperial College, meanwhile, is also involved in two clinical trials testing a vaccine against Covid-, led by Professor Robin Shattock.But experts have reminded the public that, even when a vaccine shows promise, several stages of trials will be needed to confirm it is safe ahead of an international rollout - which is unlikely to be until .

One of the study authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at LSHTM, said: It looks from the ONS data like there are about , new infections per day.And it looks like from the testing data there are about , testing positive per week. So it looks like about one in seven . So, thats not good enough, basically.Under the current system, only half of contacts are reached and only a fraction of symptomatic cases are tested, according to researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Without drastic improvements in testing the authors say it will be absolutely essential to introduce other measures in September to mitigate the effects of schools opening. Another study published out of Australia today suggested that schools could re-open safely but onlystrict rules and robust contact tracing were adhered to.The research looked at how Covid- spread in schools across NSW Australia, one of the only countries to keep schools open during the pandemic.The study, published today in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, found low levels of transmissions in schools and nurseries when control measures are in place.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Grfiths, study author, said: Our modelling suggests that with a highly effective test and trace strategy in place across the UK, it is possible for schools to reopen safely in September. However, without sufficient coverage of a test-trace-isolate strategy the UK risks a serious second epidemic peak either in December or February.Therefore, we urge the government to ensure that test-trace-isolate capacity is scaled up to a sufficient level before schools reopen. Commenting on the study, Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at University of Warwick, said: In essence the problem is simple.Reopening schools is going to increase the R number sowe are to keep R below  and prevent a second wave, some other forms of control are necessary.The reopening of schools should clearly be a key priority for the UK, many children will have gone over  months without setting foot in a classroom.The key questions are how much impact will school reopening have on the epidemic and what can be done to mitigate this.The study found a second wave could be preventeda robust testing and an adequate contact tracing system was in place.Professor Bonell said: Our study should not be used to keep schools shut because of a fear of a second wave but as a loud call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace system so we can get children back to school.He said: Were not giving specic recommendations about what sectors need to have restrictions imposed, but logically that is absolutely essential.Englands chief medical officer last week hinted pubs and restaurants may have to shut in order for schools to reopen fully in September.Professor Chris Whitty said getting children back into the classroom is pivotal for the “wellbeing of our country” - and hinted that Brits will have to sacrice other freedoms in order to do so.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory donors made up the largest group - with  party backers having been handed peerages during this period.Billionaire businessman Michael Spencer became the latest wealthy donor to be ennobled on Friday, as Boris Johnson was accused of cronyism for stuffing the Lords with  new Tory peers, including his own brother Jo Johnson.Downing Street insisted that the Prime Minister believes that the Lords should be shrunk in size - despite nominating  people in total, including Labour and non-affiliated peers.But Mr Johnson was accused of u-turning on promises to slim down the upper chamber and swelling its ranks with cronies. Analysis of the biggest donors over the past  years by the Financial Times found  donors had been made peers, donating some £.m to the main three parties either personally or through their related companies. peers were created in the period, of which  were Tory donors, three were Labour benefactors and four were Liberal Democrats.The majority of the cash came from Tory backing businessmen, including £.m from Stanley Fink, £.m from Anthony Bamford, £.m from Michael Farmer, £.m from James Lupton, £.m from Alexander Fraser and £m from David Brownlow. Mr Spencer, a former Conservative treasurer, has donated some £m to the party’s coffers through his investment firm IPGL, the paper said.  Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: “Pressure is mounting for an overhaul of the Lords, after this shocking batch of cronyistic appointments. “Even the Lord Speaker recognises that this situation is untenable and has completely over-ridden even the Lords’ modest attempts at self-regulation. “At over  members, this bloated chamber is making a mockery of democracy.” It comes after Lord Speaker Norman Fowler criticised the number of new appointments and said the move encouraged peers who were “quite frankly passengers”. Downing Street said new peers were needed to ensure the “appropriate expertise” but refused to comment on inidual appointments, such as former cricketer Ian Botham and Russian-born newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev."},{"url":null,"title":"eat out help out rishi","story":"NewsopinionEat Out to Help Out  Dont mindyou do, RishiState subsidies for junk food wont end the pandemic or save the hospitality sector, says Fleet Street Fox.

Rishi Sunak reveals a plan to give discounts for food. Great, grin all the Tories, for whom aposSoviet-style state food subsidiesapos is a phrase they utter only at election time, and about someone . What are we going to call it Um, says Rishi. We tried New Deal Meals, but itaposs a bit clumsy. We tried Meal Deal, but apparently thataposs been taken. Boris said I couldnapost have Rishiaposs Dishes. So after checking it couldnapost possibly refer to anything , weaposve decided to go with Eat Out to Help Out.Oh, thataposs catchy, say the Cabinet, for whom the concept of oral pleasure is linked firmly to Jacob Rees-Mogg saying sesquipedalian gobbledegook in a Brexit debate. And so here we are, in a topsy-turvy world in which a government of gammon are encouraging people to be, shall we say, signicantly kinder to their ladies than any of us imagine the Cabinet might ever have been.Little do these men, who have given so few gts for so long, realise it, but were anyone to follow their latest instruction to the letter it might actually ease the pandemic a bit. Some researchers have claimed that oral sex can improve levels of stress-reducing oxytocin, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, which is used to make sex hormones and can boost the immune system. Both might have some impact on heart disease and some cancers, too, which means you really can Eat Out, Protect the NHS, And Save Lives. These hormones usually peak in our s, so encouraging their production in middle or later years certainly wouldnapost hurt. Perhaps it would even convince some of the over-s angry about their suggested quarantine that it has its benefits. But wait. What am I saying  As soon as anything that might help the ladies is suggested, a man is bound to point out vaginas cause mouth cancer, and claim itaposs just another way of finishing off the male race.They wonapost care that the risk is tiny, increased a lot by smoking, and penises can pass on cancer-causing STIs too. Donapost letaposs interrupt their important business of talking themselves out of having more, or indeed any, sex.  Because more than anything , the act of giving can only improve those who, much like the Cabinet, have never given much of anything. Itaposs called the aposHelperaposs Highapos - a natural reward system hard-wired into our brains. Acts of kindness, compassion and altruism create a burst of endorphins that lower stress levels, improve self-worth and mental health, and have proven over time to even increase lespan. Itaposs an evolutionary tweak that ensures the survival of those who help others, and thereby improve their own lives too.You donapost get that bump just by going to work, having a child, or coming up with a £bn test and trace system that only half works. Itaposs no good, for example, to eventually come round to the idea of wearing a mask, or to order people to eat in a restaurant and consider youaposve done your bit for society.The endorphins donapost comeyou call it a muzzle, advise people to just get sick and stop moaning, or put your mateaposs right to make millions over the rights of millions not to die before their time. Those people may be rich, or in positions of power, but they all suffer endorphin poverty, and theyaposre easy to spot.  According to the government website which tells me where, in the nearest  miles, my meals will be discounted, Rishi will pay for part of my food at two local pubs, the second-best Indian takeaway, a truck stop greasy spoon, a farmshop, a garden centre cafe, and a winery.But seeing as his boss is busily telling us Covid- is having a resurgence, and itaposs still an incurable disease, Iaposll probably pass. A tenner off in any of those places does nothing to reduce whatever risk there is, and will probably increase my taxes in the years to come by hundreds every year. Unless everyone does it, staff will still get laid off. The sums donapost really add up. But letaposs be honest - Rishiaposs dishes are no more about helping minimum-wage waiters than they are about making himself look, well, giving. Every pound he promises sends his popularity soaring in inverse proportion to that of Boris Johnson, whose negative ratings plummet further with his every pronouncement. Neither of them are feeling the Helperaposs High. Those in government seemed to have framed the pandemic in terms only of what it can get them - closer to power, contracts for contacts, or a buff to the reputation.Making coronavirus about the inidual is the best way of letting it win. Saying masks are optional, because they wonapost be enforced, or that a corporate raideraposs right to a idend trumps that of others to reduce their risk, puts one person above others. And with this disease, the normal hierarchy is reversed - the poorest and sickest are at the front of the queue.The only response to that is collective. Because everyone  is in the queue, too, and when the poorest and sickest are gone itaposll be the less poor, and less sick, next time. It is only by protecting someone  that we are protected ourselves, only the NHS that has done enough, so far, to save us, and only reducing the risks for others that minimises our own."},{"url":null,"title":"female tory accuses government looking","story":"NewsFemale Tory accuses Government of looking the other way over MP accused of rapeEXCLUSIVE: A Conservative ex-minister said it made her sick that the MP had not been suspended from the party while a police investigation takes placeShareByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG NewsTory bosses are facing a backlash after failing to suspend an MP accused of rape \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The female MP said the Tories should have removed the whip from the ex-minister, who was arrested on Saturday over allegations of rape and sexual assault. Amid a furious backlash, No repeatedly refused to saythe Prime Minister would overturn Chief Whipaposs Mark Spenceraposs decision to allow the unnamed MP to remain in the party until a police investigation was complete. Mr Spencer, who enforces party discipline, has also been accused of failing to act on the complaint for months after it emerged that he had spoken to the woman in April. The alleged victim said she was devastated that Tory bosses refused to suspend him from the party, telling the Times it was insulting and shows they never cared.  The MP, who is in his s, has since been released on bail and denies the allegations. The senior Tory woman told the Mirror: Clearly the whips should have gripped this a long time ago. As a woman I find it really offensive. Sexual violence is obviously something I care about. When you see the machinery of government looking the other way because it is convenient - it makes me sick. The former minister said: I think the Prime Minister needs to get a wake up call on this because he does have a woman problem. This doesnapost help him. Labour also called for the MP to be suspended while a police probe takes place.Shadow Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said she would not want to send her children to schoolone of their teachers was being investigated for allegations of serious sexual assault - and demanded to know Parliament should be any dferent. She told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: What we are talking about here is a safeguarding matter, as far as Iaposm concerned. Of course everybody is innocent until proven guilty in our criminal justice system. However, Iaposm not sure that I would want to send my child, for example, to a school where a teacher had been arrested and bailed for the crime of rape or sexual assault. I would expect in those circumstances - as is safeguarding law - that those people would be suspended pending further investigation. She added: The PM has to answer the question this morning - is he happy for a young woman who might have been raped or abused to go and seek today advice from this person   The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman repeatedly refused to comment on whether the whip should have been removed. He said: I don’t know the details of this case. In any event, it’s not appropriate for me to comment on an ongoing police investigation. The MP was arrested on Saturday after the woman in her s alleged she had been assaulted four times, including a rape so traumatic that she sought hospital treatment. He has since been released. The Mirror understands the woman raised her concerns with Mr Spencer on April . But sources close to the Chief Whip said the woman did not make an allegation of serious sexual assault at that point.

He captures photos and videos to showcase the decline of historic premises and long-forgotten homes left frozen in time, as reported by Yorkshire Live.His explorations include old hotels and colleges, and since lockdown has eased he went out to film at two abandoned homes on the site of a former psychiatric asylum, which has now become a student campus. Itaposs thought the home has been left abandoned for almost  years after the asylum closed down in . Daniel films as he climbs in through the window, finding walls covered in graffiti and a mattress dumped on the floor of a living area. A trainer that has been left to gather dust on the fireplace is placed below a message written on the wall reading aposDonapost touch the shoeapos, with the ground littered with debris and rubbish as wallpaper hangs off the walls. The urban explorer admits he gets nervous when he goes inside abandoned homes alone and gets spooked by a noise when he shines a torch up the darkened wooden staircase before making a swt exit. He s on another day with his friend to give it a second shot, sharing a video of their findings which includes a copy of a The Express newspaper from  in a bathroom.They also explored a second home nicknamed aposTunnel Snakes Houseapos after the bizarre graffiti on boards covering the windows, finding the interior in a similar state. Daniel said: I used to explore on my own but over time Iaposve become used to exploring with other people as anything can happen in these places so I am just a bit careful and try not to take chances when Iaposm in a location with only a few exits.

Alun Elder-Brown, who is registered blind, captured the incident after the owner ed to his vehicle having apparently left his pet in the sweltering heat. Temperatures in Normanaposs Bay, East Sussex, reached  degrees last Wednesday, prompting concern from a group of bystanders who spotted the dog barking from inside the car. The video begins with Alun and the group expressing concern for the animal, they say has been left in  degree heat. Eventually, the dogaposs owner s to the vehicle and a woman begins shouting: Is this your dog  Get it taken home before I ring the police. Itaposs been there for two hours. Bloody ridiculous. The woman keeps shouting, while the man pays her no attention. She accuses him of cruelty, but the man insists he has been ing to his vehicle to check on the dog.  He becomes more angry as the accusations continue, before suddenly launching a kick at Alun as he films. He then pushes the woman away as she keeps telling him to get the dog out of the car. Eventually he removes the dog from the car and Alun explains to the man that he is registered blind. At this point, more people appear telling him to f off and he fills up a dish with water for the dog.  The parched pooch is then seen lapping up the water, before his owner takes him with him back to the pub. Alun says he has reported the man under the Animal Welfare Act , but chose not to pursue an assault charge. He shared the video on Facebook, saying: Dog left for an hour and a half in a pub car park in soaring heat. The owner, who has been reported to the police under the Animal Welfare Act , then assaulted me.  The police were called, not by me but a lady bystander. The policewoman informed me he would most definitely be reported for the crime of animal cruelty, though I am not pursing the assault.  Note: I only showed up towards the later stages of this situation.

Boris Johnson and ministers were said to be mulling over advising millions of older people to isolate as cases continue to surge, as one of a number of possibilities.But critics had said the controversial idea failed to take into account the importance of that age bracket in terms of the countryaposs workforce - while also being discriminatory. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HEREInstead, they pointed the government in the direction of rule-flouting youths, who they said need to be more effectively forced to social distance and avoiding mass gatherings.  It comes after photos showed younger people continuously breaching restrictions during the heatwave over the weekend.Former Labour government adviser Baroness Joan Bakewell, , told the Daily Mail : Young people assume it is over and are not distancing themselves as they should. They know they should, they have been told they should, but they cannot be bothered. That is the crux. Ex-Conservative minister Ros Altmann said: What weaposre talking about here is a group in society that is being potentially singled out for dferent treatment just on the basis of their age. While Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: It is both ageist and ill-thought-out. Some under-s have underlying health conditions, while some over s are key to our economy.The plan would have reportedly seen people aged between  and  a personalised risk rating advising them whether to shield. It would mean that people could be forced to shield because of their age in coming months - and vulnerable people identied in March would once again be made to isolate themselves.It was being weighed up as one of a string of alternatives to reimposing full nationwide lockdown restrictions, as happened in March, it is claimed.Tory minister Robert Jenrick has, however, insisted the idea was not being actively considered and said it was speculation. No sources also called the reports speculative.

Critics accused them of being “racist” and claimed their black faces could cause “deep hurt” to BAME people. But members of the Coconut Dancers in Bacup, Lancashire, insist it is part of a tradition dating back more than  years. Every year on Easter Saturday they black up to dance seven miles behind a brass band to mark out the town’s boundaries – calling in every pub on the way. They claim it dates back to when local miners danced as they emerged from the pits with their faces blackened by coal dust. And they have unanimously voted to carry on, saying it was a “unique mining tradition” not connected with “ethnicity nor any form of racial prejudice”. The Joint Morris Organisation, the umbrella group which represents the country’s  dancing “sides”, ruled last month that members must stop blacking up following the Black Lives Matter campaign. They said said “full face black or other skin tone make-up is a practice that has the potential to cause deep hurt”. In a statement, they added: “Teams that continue to use make-up will find they are no longer part of the mainstream morris community, be covered by JMO public liability insurance, or invited to take part in events organised or sponsored by the JMO. “Morris is a unique cultural tradition of which we should be rightly proud. We want people from all races and backgrounds to share in this pride and not be made to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.” But the Bacup group – who get their name from the curved wooden disks called coconuts that they bang together while dancing to the local brass band – said they were carrying on a “unique mining tradition”.   They insisted it was not connected to “ethnicity nor any form of racial prejudice” and said they were saddened that people did not think it “fit for the modern day”. Their statement added: “The Britannia Coconutters have evolved within our community upholding a folk dance and music which is honest and unique. “Our age-old tradition is embedded in the hearts and souls of the people of Bacup, Rossendale and overseas.  “As a team we have discussed the use of black face make-up in great detail and have come to a unanimous decision that this will continue to be part of our unique mining tradition. “Removing any part of our costume will take away the mystique of who we are. “The dances were devised by local miners. Since they all had permanently black faces on working days, from the outset it became an essential part of the tradition that they also performed with black faces. “This tradition has now been maintained continuously for more than a century. It has no connection with ethnicity nor any form of racial prejudice.” “We trust that the JMO will understand and respect our decision to continue with the integrity and respect as we have for many centuries.”  Peter Simpson, squire of the Morris Ring, one of three organisations that make up the Joint Morris Organisation, said: It is both sad and regrettable that we have come to this impasse which has been driven by outside forces. We would like to wish the Nutters all the best for the future and hopefully in time we will find a way to work together again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus infections double parts greater","story":"NewsCoronavirus infections double in parts of Greater Manchester as R rate risesGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has warned the R rate in the North West may be above one, which means Covid- is spreading, with infection rates rising in eight out of  Manchester boroughs last weekShareCommentsByPaul ByrneOliver Milne:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsCoronavirus infections doubled in parts of Greater Manchester last week \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham yesterday warned the “R Rate” in the North West may be above one, meaning the infection is spreading. He tweeted: “North West at .. Underlines the need for caution and to follow the guidance.” Infection rates, the number of cases per , people, rose in eight of the  Manchester boroughs last week. In Stockport, it rose from . to ., with  new cases. In Bury, it rose from . to ., with  new cases. In ­Tameside, it was up from . to ., with  new cases. In Rochdale and Wigan, infection rates fell. Yesterday, as Manchester was coming to terms with a “major incident” being declared, the Government confirmed more areas could be locked down and travel bannedcoronavirus cases rise. Lockdown restrictions were re-imposed in parts of the North West and West Yorkshire last Friday, banning people from visiting the homes and gardens of friends and neighbours. But bars and restaurants have been busy in the city in recent days. And there are fears that soaring temperatures later this week will lead to large gatherings. Downing Street has confirmed travel in and out of towns and cities, including London, could be banned to stop spikes.  A spokesman said “closing down local transport networks” was one of the measures in the “contain strategy”an area was “particularly badly affected”. He said: “We have informed the public and politicians of that being a potential action we could take. It is not something specic to London. It would be because there has been a specic outbreak in a town, city or localised areas.” It could mean banning people living in the capital from going outside the M. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has written to PM Boris Johnson to voice “great surprise” at suggestions of a ­quarantine zone within the M.  Mr Khan complained it had been  weeks since he had been invited to a COBRA meeting, and he branded the lack of consultation “unacceptable”.Local government leaders in Gtr Manchester, who declared a major incident on Sunday after a rise in infection rates, have told the public there is no need to panic. Sir Richard Leese, Manchester City Council leader, said it was “standard practice for complex situations”.He said: “People should not be alarmed.”But it opens the door to the Army being drafted in to support the police and other emergency services.Former Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said: “Normally a major incident is declared when there is a terrorist attack or extreme weather.  “It means there is one command centre, all the key people are working together in the same room. But it does show how serious agencies in Greater Manchester are viewing this situation.” Last month, a major incident was declared in Bournemouth when thousands of people packed on to beaches. And with temperatures set to hit C and above later this week, Sir Peter said: “The biggest concern for the police will be about public gatherings.” In Liverpool, public health officials hope to deal with an increase in cases in the Princes Park area without additional lockdown measures. A walk-in test centre was installed in the area on Saturday and anyone shielding is being asked to continue to shield until August . Volunteers are going door to door to raise awareness of testing availability.

The general consensus is we can get all the vitamins and minerals we need from a well-balanced diet. And there’s no discernible evidence taking those pills and potions will reduce your risk of conditions like heart disease or help you live longer. “The evidence for the actual health benefits is rather limited,” says Leeds GP Dr Gary Bartlett, echoing the thoughts of so many of his colleagues. “Eating fruit, vegetables, carbohydrates and whole grains with the correct amount of protein will be way more beneficial in maintaining good health over taking a supplement.” But statistics show that, in the real world, for many reasons,this is not always the case. “Diet should always come first,” says Dr Sarah Brewer, GP, nutritionist and medical director of Healthspan. “But the National Diet and Nutrition Surveysconsistently show signicant numbers of the population do not get all the vitamins and minerals they need from their food.” This could be because of poor diet choices, such as relying on processed foods, or other factors – like avoiding certain food groups because you simply don’t like them or for ethical reasons. Then there are those on a restrictive weight loss plan older people whose nutrient absorption is less efficient and menstruating girls at risk of low iron levels. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, our diet fails to give us all we need, suggests Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author. “Vegans, for instance, are likely to benefit from taking a vitamin B supplement as this nutrient isn’t found in many plant foods,” he says. “And,you’re not getting your five- a-day or eating oily fish, then a daily multivitamin and mineral should be considered.” What should I be looking for in a supplement  “Quality is key,” explains Dr Brewer. “Look for products made to a pharmaceutical standard known as Good Manufacturing Practice . “This tests products for purity and consistency of dose at every stage of manufacture and is usually mentioned as a quality point on manufacturers’ ‘About Us’ web page. “You can also try searching on the internet for the name of  your chosen brand plus the term ‘GMP’.” And be choosy where you buy them. Vitamin and mineral supplements sold in high street pharmacies or from trusted online retailers offer quality and value for money, says Dr Brewer. “You get what you pay for. Check labels to compare levels of ingredients between brands and that you are buying a quality product.” Does the type you take matter  Whether you take a tablet, capsule, a liquid, gummies or spray is really down to personal choice, says Dr Brewer. “Although, in general, a tablet will provide a wider range of vitamins and minerals than a gummy or spray.” Are there any risks  Dr Brewer says: “It is important to check with a pharmacist or doctoryou have a medical condition oryou are taking any prescribed or over-the-counter drugs. Also check before taking any supplementsyou are pregnant, or planning to be, orbreast-feeding. The risk of side-effects is very low as long as you do not exceed the manufactureraposs recommended daily intake of any supplement. Could I take too much  There is a wide safety margin between what most supplements deliver and what would be required  to cause side-effects or toxic reactions, Dr Brewer explains. If taking a multivitamin, be careful about taking additional supplements that include fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K as these can be stored in the body and accumulate to toxic levels when intakes are too high.

The Cogshall Hall estate in Cheshire has been described by Historic England as of aposnational importanceapos, and selling for a price on par with London prices. The Comberbach mansion has between five and  bedrooms dependingthe estate is sold in two lots or sold as one and has been on the market for almost a year, since September .Located on a country lane on the edge of a pretty village, itaposs surrounded by lush green countryside and set back from the road via a long drive, Manchester Evening News reports.The only clue about the scale of the property is the unusual abstract metal gates that front it, which are reminiscent of tree branches. The Grade II-listed country house was built in  for wealthy landowner Peter Jackson. It is constructed from Flemish bond brick with Derbyshire grit stone dressings and stone column porticos. A rear wing was added in the th century. The distinctive mansion entrance has five bays and an Ionic portico, with a similar smaller portico tucked away to the side. It was described as a house of note in Peter de Figuereidoaposs tome Cheshire Country Houses.The property is on the Rightmove with agents Knight Frank, which sells some of the most expensive and desirable houses nationwide. Historic England describes it as a country house circa , Flemish bond red-brown brick, grey slate hipped roof, two storeys, rectangular. Five windows to entrance front seven to right face five to left face. A recessed flat-roofed kitchen wing was added in the th century. The principal rooms are described as having good plaster cornices with floral, foliar and fruit mots.  The front two rooms have good led plaster ceilings - one has overmantel supported by two dancing maidens in marble. It also has good plaster cornices in its bedrooms which are less rich than downstairs. In its overall assessment, Historic England describes the property as a good and complete example of a late Georgian country house. The owner of the property has not been revealed. What is known is that it has previously been ownedby the publicity-shy former Manchester Grammar School student turned venture capitalist Anthony Preston, who established the Pets At Home chain.  The father-of-three went on to build up the Kids Unlimited network of childrenaposs nurseries and properties. In a previous interview with the Manchester Evening News about Pets At Home, Mr Preston explained that he set up the company in  and it floated on the London Stock Exchange in , valued at £.bn. But it is not clear who owns the mansion now. Knight Frank describe it as the quintessential English country house in the middle of about  acres of parkland and farmland at the end of a long driveway. It has stabling and extensive secondary accommodation, extensive leisure facilities and an indoor pool and spa with breathtaking gardens.  The agent says the hall displays the best of Georgian architecture, being symmetrical in proportions, with an exquisite suite of graceful reception rooms of extraordinary quality, and exceptional ceiling height to both the ground and first floors. This, combined with the large casement sash windows, makes the house very light and airy.    The listing describes the impressive indoor pool complex aposwith spa and doors out the walled garden with its spectacular water featureapos. The estate also has a secondary house with guest accommodation, office, a party room, office, cottage with three bedrooms all around a cobbled courtyard. Thereaposs a stable yard and outdoor adding to the aposall round facilitiesapos, together with landscaped designed gardens and parkland. In total, the floor area is , to , square foot and the house has a whopping . acres of land. And it is a freehold property. The hall has outbuildings, a tennis court, swimming pool, stabling and is set in the most aposmagnicent and accessible location, ring-fenced by its own extensive grounds and off a quiet rural laneapos.

Holly Blake went to AE with breathlessness and a persistent pain in her leg, but an x-ray revealed she had metastasised cancer in her lungs, which had already spread throughout her body. The -year-old, from Edinburgh, has given up her job as a digital facilitator as she undergoes her third round of chemotherapy at the city’s Western General Hospital. After an ineffective second round of chemotherapy, Holly was told she has a ‘maximum of six months’ to live. Holly, who had no health issues before her devastating diagnosis, said: “We had no idea and I had no symptoms. “I thought I had a blood clot in my leg and I got sent for an x-ray, then they found my lungs were full of metastasised cancer. “It’s small blue cell sarcoma. It’s a rare kind of sarcoma that’s spread through my lymph nodes to my calves. “By the end of that week we knew the full picture. “I’m in hospital just now finishing my third round of chemo. “Unfortunately the last round wasn’t effective. “If this doesn’t work I’m looking at a few months to live - or maximum six months. “Either way my prognosis isn’t great, it’s stage four. This is management, rather than get rid of it. It was just total shock and disbelief. “It was the absolute last thing I would’ve expected. I’ve not had any health or lung problems. I don’t drink either.”  Holly’s family have rallied round to support her and help look after her six children - Eli, , Poppy , twins Daisy and Pippa, ten, and her youngest twins Edward and Primrose, two. She added: My family are just in bits. I have six young children and my youngest twins will be three next month. How do you get your head around that - it’s le changing stuff. “Everybody’s been amazing. I’ve had so much support and everybody’s pulled together. “My little two have a dferent dad and he’s looking after them by himself and has given up his job. I hope to do some nice things with the kids before I die.” Holly is hoping to hear in the next few daysher third round of chemotherapy has been successful.

While some were just short flings, he had a number of long-terms loves which ended in heartbreak and awkward reunions. As is traditional in the royal family, Harry invited several of his exes to his and Meghanaposs royal wedding in . Many of Harryaposs former flings have gone on to do pretty exciting things since their brief time with the royals - including reality TV shows, acting careers and very, very pricey weddings. Weaposve had a look at what some of Harryaposs exes have been up to since breaking up with him. Chelsy Davy Zimbabwean-born Chelsy was Harryaposs first love, and the couple met in Cape Town when he was on his gap year in . They were on and off for seven years, splitting for good in  as she struggled with the publicity and pressure that came with dating a royal. Despite the breakup, Chelsy still attended the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs wedding in , which was reportedly the moment she realised she had made the right decision to end things. Writing in royal biography Harry: Conversations with the Prince, journalist Angela Levin said: “A friend revealed that seeing the enormity and pomp of the day convinced Chelsy that she and Harry had been right to separate.  “Although they had a lot in common, she saw clearly that because they came from such dferent worlds it could never have worked, especially as she valued her privacy and guarded it so carefully.” Speaking about her time with Harry, she told The Times: It was so full-on. Crazy and scary and uncomfortable. I found it very dficult when I was bad. I couldn’t cope. I was young, I was trying to be a normal kid and it was horrible. Chelsy, the daughter of a South African safari farmer and a former Coca-Cola model, is a trained lawyer but has turned jewellery designer.  She splits her time between Africa and the UK and is happily dating a new boyfriend. Florence Brudenell-Bruce Lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce - known to her pals as aposFleaapos - had a brief summer fling with Harry in . Florence, who has also been linked to F star Jenson Button, went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in the south of France, and she and Harry remain friends.  Sheaposs recently appeared on Channel  show The Great Pottery Throwdown. Mollie King The popstar, who shot to fame with the girl group The Saturdays, went on a few days with Harry back in .The Strictly Come Dancing star confessed: “Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.” However, Harry reportedly called things off as her celebrity status made things dficult. Mollie went on to date David Gandy, but has now settled down with England cricketer Stuart Broad. Ellie Goulding The Starry Eyed singer was reportedly dating Harry in . The couple were spotted cosying up at Audi Polo Challenge in May of that year.  They met at Kate and Williamaposs wedding in , where Ellie performed, and exchanged flirty texts and she joined him at the Invictus Games in . A source told The Sun at the time: He has told friends how much he likes Ellie and she is clearly taken by him. After their split Ellie found love with at dealer Caspar Joplin, and the pair tied the knot in August last year. While she didnapost get a royal wedding, their bash was still pretty spectacular and was estimated to cost about £million. The brides pals Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended, along with a number of celebrity guests. Jenna Coleman The Victoria and Doctor Who actress reportedly went on a few days with Harry in , and he was spotted resting his hand on her leg at a party. But it wasnapost meant to be and they went their separate ways, however they had a slightly awkward reunion a few years later.  When Meghan and Harry went to Amsterdam in , they reportedly bumped into Jenna at a party - but completely avoided each other. A source told Vanity Fair: It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it. Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice. Jenna went on to date her Victoria co-star Tom Hughes for four years, however they sadly split last month. Her career is going from strength to strength, and sheaposs got lots of exciting projects in the pipeline. Camilla Thurlow Back in , Love Islandaposs most unlikely singleton - bomb disposal expert and charity worker Camilla - hinted she had dated the prince. There were lots of rumours about her brief romance with Harry back in , however she remained tight-lipped.  But, according to Now magazine, a source close to Camilla said: “Harry thought she was amazing and seemed to want something serious, but she refused to open up to him through fear of being rejected.“It was Camilla’s reservations that stopped their romance from going anywhere.” Camilla is dating model Jamie Jewitt, who she met on the show, and the couple are expecting their first child. Since leaving the show, sheaposs carried on her charity worker and used her  to raise awareness of causes close to her heart, as well as writing a book. Cressida Bonas A year after splitting from Chelsy, Harry hooked up with actress and model Cressida after Princess Eugenie introduced them. They dated for two years until . At the time of their split, a friend said: “It’s very sad that they have decided to split but this is a completely amicable separation and they are remaining the very best of friends. After their split, Cressida started dating Harry Wentworth-Stanley, an estate agent and the son of the Marchioness of Milford Haven, and the pair married earlier this month.

Lawyers acting on behalf of The Crown argue that the business name along with a golden crest on a website belonging to Grant Harrold, who worked for Prince Charles from  until , are misleading the public into believing he still has an official job working for the Royal Household.The row comes after the -year-old monarch in February banned Prince Harry and his we Meghan from using the brand Sussex Royal in a bid to build a new le and make a fortune following their dramatic resignation from The Firm.Mr Harrold, a regular guest on popular TV shows This Morning and Good Morning Britain where he hands out etiquette advice, has argued the sitcom The Royle Family was allowed to broadcast unchallenged despite its dferent spelling. The former palace staffer also claims a reference, confirming his appointment by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales as a royal butler, allows him to use the label. A royal source said: “The result of this case will be very interesting. Mr Harrold has been marketing himself as such for a good few years without an issue. “One does wonder whether this has more to do with the Queen’s grandson and his we having their wings clipped so a point of order must be made.”  Mr Muir Wood, acting on behalf of the Queen, said the public would also be misled by Harrold’s pictures of him posing next to a waxwork of Her Majesty at Madame Tussauds and that some would not even be able to tell the dference between the model and the real thing. At an Intellectual Property office hearing on July , he said: “We say it is possible that members of the public would believe he is educating butlers on behalf of The Queen at his Royal Butler School, that he was appearing in the media as her representative, as a representative of the household of her Royal Family. He also dismissed Harrold’s business partner Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, the grand niece of Prince Philip, as not being a proper member of the Royal Family.

The system is said to be reaching only around % of contacts and a spike will hit in December without improvement. Schools opening in September may fuel the crisis. Scientist Professor Chris Bonell said Test and Trace “is not good enough basically”. He added: “We’re suggesting schools have to go back in September. It’s so critically important for the economy but also for children’s educational wellbeing. “Our study should not be used to keep schools shut over a fear of a second wave but as a call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace. The damning verdict on the Government’s flawed testing system came in a paper from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where Prof Bonell works, and University College London. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Modelling found NHS Test and Trace, staffed largely by outsourcing firms such as Serco, should be reaching at least % of contacts to avoid a deadly second Covid- wave. The study found the wave could be . times bigger than the first in a worst case scenario. Andthings do not improve, that means we could be heading for a second national lockdown. But just one in seven people with virus symptoms are coming forward to get tested and be entered on to the contact-tracing system.  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “ Boris Johnson promised us a world-beating test and trace system. Instead the system isn’t tracing enough people.” Prof Bonell said public confidence may have been hit by Dominic Cummings breaching lockdown rules and driving from London to Durham with signs of coronavirus. He added: “This really requires that the population has trust in the system which may not always be the case at the moment in the aftermath of Dominic Cummings.  “A key factor that has to be considered is the proportion of those who are told to isolate, are actually isolating.” NHS Test and Trace has no data on how many of those contacted follow rules as it does not carry out follow-up calls. Modellers estimate % of staff willto their workplaces once schools are reopened, solving childcare problems.

The global pandemic has thrust her into the spotlight and global heads - including US President Donald Trump - have speculated that Sars-CoV-, the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-, accidentally escaped from her lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.China has rejected the claims while Shi has, until now, remained quiet.  But in response an email to the magazine Science, Shi hit back at the speculation.She said her team discovered the virus in , as patients with a curious and unknown pneumonia provided samples. She added: Before that, we had never been in contact with or studied this virus, nor did we know of its existence. US President Trumpaposs claim that Sars-CoV- was leaked from our institute totally contradicts the facts. It jeopardizes and affects our academic work and personal le. He owes us an apology. For  years, Shiaposs lab has isolated and grown in culture three bat coronaviruses that relate to that which infected humans, the coronavirus agent which caused the Sars pandemic in , she told the publication. She claimed the , other bat coronaviruses were genetic sequences taken from swabs and faeces from bats, and one of these was . per cent identical to Sars-CoV-. In response to claims one of her staff or students sparked the pandemic, she said they has all tested negative recently.  Shi slammed a decision by the US National Institutes of Health to scrap a grant to the EcoHealth Alliance in New York that included bat virus research at her lab. She said: We donapost understand [it] and feel it is absolutely absurd. She remains clear that the coronavirus originated in bats. She said: According to the findings of our team and our international peers, Sars-CoV- is very likely to have originated from bats.It may have evolved in one or more intermediate hosts, become adapted to humans, and eventually spread among humans. However, it remains unclear which animals were the intermediate hosts and how it spilled over to humans. Shiaposs comments are very exciting said Daniel Lucey of Georgetown University. He told Science: There are a lot of new facts that I wasnapost aware of. Itaposs very exciting to hear this directly from her.

Speaking to News, agriculture officials said: Invasive species wreak havoc on the environment, displace or destroy native plants and insects and severely damage crops.Have you received the seeds  Email  webnews@mirrorTaking steps to prevent their introduction is the most effective method of reducing both the risk of invasive species infestations and the cost to control and mitigate those infestations.And, in a terrying warning given the current global context, the Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller warned the seeds could be a bacteria. He told CBS DFW: It could be another virus, some kind of invasive species. The US Department of Agriculture is understood to have identied some of the species of plant contained in seed bags being received by Americans. Amid warnings that the seeds could contain invasive species, the deputy administrator Osama El-Lissy of the departmentaposs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported that the seeds included - - mustard - cabbage - morning glory - hibiscus - roses Also herbs like - - mint - sage - rosemary - lavender El-Lissy reported at least  of the seed species had been identied as of July .reader Liz Rhodes told us: I was given some of these by a friend, so I sowed them and they have come up beautully and flowered.  They seem to be courgettes or marrows and I have about six healthy plants in large pots.  For context, the Commonwealth nation of Australia is famously obsessive about blocking invasive species of plants, animals and bacteria from disrupting the balanced ecology of the country. An example of an invasive species of plant which has wreaked havoc in the UK would be Japanese knotweed, which can damage concrete foundations, buildings, flood defences, roads, paving, retaining walls and architectural sites. Meanwhile, grey squirrels are a notorious invasive species of animal, which has decimated Britainaposs native population of red squirrels. People around the globe are receiving the strange packets of seeds in the post without any explanation as to who they come from or why theyaposve been sent.  All that is known is the parcels come from China and people in the US and UK have reported receiving them totally out of the blue. There was explanation as to why people were getting these packages but they usually have Chinese writing on and are labelled as containing jewellery, possibly to avoid security checks. All  states in the US have sent out warnings against them in case they are dangerous. The problem has been quite prolic, with  reports in Florida alone. People are being warned not to plant the seeds, as those from from other parts of the world could damage local crops.  Robin Pruisner of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship in Iowa, said she had received reports of seeds coated in a potential insecticide or fungicide. She said: Iaposve had people describe to me that the seeds are coated with something purple. I havenapost had it in my hands yet, but it sounds an awful lot like a seed treatment. Areader told us: I, a few days ago, received a similar packet. This made me think, particularly the description, aposStud earringapos. Putting my thinking cap on I remembered I had ordered many months ago - aposwhite button mushroom seedsapos - by which I presume they meant mushroom spawn from an Amazon UK seller.  I  had completely forgotten the order until this package arrived, obviously labelled aposStud earringapos to get through Customs. In the circumstances I will  not chance planting the seeds but will put them on the fire. In the US, the Iowa Agriculture Department has told the public the mysterious packages are likely part of a brushing scam. This involves a seller sending products which to people who have not requested them The seller then places fake customer reviews onto buying sites, such as Amazon, in order to drive sales.  The US Department of Agriculture said: Brushing scams involving seed packets in international mail shipments are not uncommon. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has intercepted similar seed shipments in recent years. Meanwhile, Phylissia Clark of the Better Business Bureau told CBS DFW that victims of aposbrushingapos that their identity has been compromised. She said: Somebody knows enough about you to create a profile online and use you to manipulate systems. At a rough count, at least   households in England have received the packages which have turned up in several European countries.

The players will know that. We were a wee bit loose when the ball got turned over and we get punished for that.”Mellon, having been round the course plenty of times both on and off the pitch in England, is shrewd enough a manager to know singling out “loose” players at this early stage of his tenure at Tannadice will do him no favours.Especially when, on Saturday, Lawrence Shankland was particularly worthy of the tag.United’s talisman was uncharacteristically quiet in the first half against Saints.Perth captain Jason Kerr was tasked with sticking to Shankland like glue and did so effectively, limiting the Tannadice hit man to a bit part in the game before the break.However, with United a goal and a man up after Michael O’Halloran’s sending off, last season’s top scorer emerged for the second half looking determined to make an impact in front of goal.Shankland’s keenness to open his top flight account was clear to see.Instead, after fluffing a couple of chances, the striker appeared to tire  minutes in and, with Saints in possession, clearly gave up on chasing possession from Saints’ Ali McCann, despite his manager’s audible encouragement from the technical area.With Shankland out of gas, McCann, unchallenged, found Kerr, who then found Danny McNamara, whose cross led to the botched Mark Connolly clearance lashed home by Liam Craig for the short-handed Perth side’s equaliser.Instructions were given by Micky Mellon. Instructions weren’t followed. A goal was coughed up.At this level – even against a weakened side – such things can be decisive.“Credit to St Johnstone, they dug in with  men and then we have to go and break down a block,” said the United boss.“We kept prodding and poking away at it but we just weren’t able to undo a packed block.“But we will learn our lessons and move on. That’s what it’s about, we are in a transition, we have moved up a ision.“There are a lot of players who are playing at this level again for the first time in a long time or playing for the first time, as well as having a -year-oldmaking his debut.“We will gather the positives and move on to training next week and be ready to move the club on again.”Victorious teams never talk about taking – or gathering – the positives from games.Instead, it tends to be a phrase beaten managers and players use to deflect from negatives.United weren’t beaten on Saturday but, at full time, a draw didn’t feel like a good result.Having played against  men for a full half, that’s understandable.But as the dust settles, the clearer it should become that there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful for the Tangerines.From kick-off until half time, United looked like a serious Premiership side. They were first to every ball. They were sharp, drilled and positive.Their movement was like clockwork. Their shape was well defined. They knew exactly what they were doing.There were issues – Shankland was far too quiet for somebody so potentially influential, while their second half performance was poor.But, as Micky Mellon said, it’s all about detail.The fact United fans can look at their side and say there are fine margins between the point they won on day one and the three they will be looking for next weekend against Motherwell ought to be heartening.The Tangerines, as a club, are back where they belong.If they can replicate their first half performance against Saints, they’ll soon be picking up the wins that will help them stay there.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The Scottish game is built on a foundation of bitter competition between clubs, not Kumbaya around the campfire.So, in a province so in thrall to the old ways that the idea of adding a vegan pie to the half-time menu could be considered dangerously progressive, the fact that all  Premiership clubs have managed to set up live online streaming services for locked out fans within the space of six weeks is remarkable.Today is D Day – the day we find out whether it all works, with tens of thousands of fans around the country depending on it after months of twiddling their thumbs.And there’s a certain irony to that…Finally, having been pushed into a corner, Scottish football, that most backward of institutions, is utterly, pleadingly, desperately reliant on technology to preserve one of its grandest traditions # the first day of the season.Today is not an opening day in any of the ways we’re used to.There will be no fishing new season books out of the drawer, there will be no walking out the front door to meet friends for a pre-match pint, nor that tingle of anticipation as the ground comes into view.There won’t be the rush of being part of the crowd and no roar as the teams emerge from the tunnel.What there will be, however, is a match and a means to watch it.Under the circumstances, we should all be grateful for that # so thanks, technology. Thanks, progress.But as far as vegan pies go, let’s just learn to walk before we can run.Dundee United and St Johnstone is a great pairing for kick-off day.For the Tangerines, it’s a perfect opportunity to gauge where they are against an established top flight side.For Saints, it’s a stf test at the home of a newly promoted side brimming with confidence.I certainly can’t wait to watch it.The only disappointing thing is that there won’t be any fans inside Tannadice.Under the circumstances – local rivals, first game of the season, United’s Premiership , short away trip for Saints fans – I reckon the place would have been close to full.A rocking Tannadice would have been the perfect setting for the Tangerines’ first top flight game in four years.Instead, it will be close to empty # but hopefully the action will still be lively.Both sides have new managers so, to an extent, both will be unknown quantities.But we’ll know a lot more about both sides # and both managers # by teatime.If that prospect doesn’t get you going after months without fooball nothing will.Celtic kick off their quest for a th consecutive title tomorrow against Hamilton Accies.As far as I#m concerned, you might as well hand them the trophy now.I can#t see anybody stopping them this season.They#re so far ahead both on and off the pitch they#re practically uncatchable.If, come January, the title race is in any way close, they#ll drop millions on signings.Nobody can compete with that.

It is all very surreal still but the support from the local community and the people of Dundee has been overwhelming.#The lads have got together to do this for us. The support we have had from everyone has been amazing. This is just the kind of gesture I would expect from these boys.#I will be taking part in memory of Freya.#Robert said he didn#t yet know how any money raised would be used but he and the family would sit down and think of the best way to put it to use.He added: #I know initially it will help to take some of the pressure off. Even going back to work is a thought so this will go a long way to making le easier for us all in the short term.Robert will join the weekend along with Freya#s mum Brooke and partner Dale, who will climb Ben Nevis with them on the Saturday.Ellis McDonald, who has helped organise the event, said that  of Robert#s friends # from Clepington Road Primary and Morgan Academy # had come together to help the family.Ellis said: #Our school friend Robert, and Freya#s mother, Brooke, recently suffered a loss that no parent ever should.#The coming weeks, months and years will be dficult to say the least, and the emotional support of friends and family will be vital.#Beginning on Friday, the group will travel to Glencoe and then begin a  mile hike to Fort William.The following day, the friends will make their way to Glen Nevis to begin the ,ft ascent of Ben Nevis.Ellis added: #We would appreciate any and all donations, large or small, in order to support Robert and Brooke through this impossibly dficult period.#If anyone is interested in joining us, please get in touch, the more participants the better to help carry the walking wounded.#He said #Little Freya lives on in all our hearts.#The lads taking part so far are Garry Smith, Ellis McDonald, Stephen Whitton, Keiran Clement, Jordan Dewar, Stuart Lyon, Nicky Cobb,  Lee Henry, Gary Shields, Jonny McBride, Dean Elder.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

bought the Victoria Street building last December.It has sat vacant since the congregations of Dunbar Methodist Church and nearby St Annersquos Scottish Episcopal Church merged in , with the congregation now meeting at the latter.Few changes are proposed for the building, with the developer keen to ldquoensure an important part of the historic fabric of Dunbar can be retained intact for the enjoyment of future generations.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has already had discussions with the applicants, who live in the town and plan to operate the venue themselves.She was ldquoabsolutely thrilled at the plans for the site and said: ldquoThe sooner it comes back into happy reuse the better for everybody.The community council chairwoman noted that the building was in a prominent position in a recognisable part of the town.She added: ldquoThere were lots of fears ndash it is not a listed building ndash that it would be knocked down and flats built or that it would be knocked down and a house would go up.ldquoThe idea the shell is to be kept and windows restored and used as a wedding venue social venue has been greeted incredibly warmly.A list of benefits for the proposed change of use are included within a supporting statement, which was submitted as part of the planning application.Among the suggested benefits of the scheme are: that it would complement existing hotels and venues by offering a new type of space for small and intimate weddings and other ceremonies that is not currently available in the town it would generate income for local businesses, in particular contributing to the increased use of local hotels and guest houses for short stays in and around Dunbar and it would contribute to ldquothe viability of the town

being granted is the restoration of the stained glass windows.ldquoThe restoration will be undertaken at signicant cost by a firm of specialist craftsmen experienced in the restoration of antique ecclesiastical stained glass.It is hoped refurbishment works at the venue could get under way early next year.Dunbarrsquos Methodist Congregation was founded in  and was well established when John

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain. Among those caught out by the rule change was Englandrsquos Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.Jon Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary, called the Governmentrsquos performance ldquoshambolic.\"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenere who are confused, and they dont know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks quarantine. The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Its latest position paper, Learning to Live Alongside Covid-, was ostensibly the reason for his latest appearance.It was a wide-ranging interview covering everything from Russia and China to Scottish independence. You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do. A lot of people might think thatrsquos exactly what he should do, stop talking about things. But I care about the country, I think we are at a huge moment of change in the world.Addressing the elephant backseat passenger in the room, he went on: ldquoIrsquove tried to do something that previous prime ministers have not done, but in the future I predict that many more will try and do because you leave office when yoursquove still got a lot of years of active working le.ldquoI always say to peopleyou donrsquot want to listen to me itrsquos a free world, donrsquot bother.\"But Irsquom not going to be playing rounds of golf or sitting twiddling my thumbs.

Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s...

It was great. It was also just an incredible learning experience.\"\"I always say that I am always surprised by how much we liked each other because Ive done so many projects with people that I absolutely hated,\" Marwan follows candidly.\"At the end of the day, its a job. But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"town-country-five-best-places-find-beautiful-sunsets-scotland","story":"As the nights begin to get longer and the sun sets slightly earlier, do not miss the opportunity to catch an incredible Scottish sunset.

She never knowingly places a mark where there shouldnrsquot be one, working in oil paints on paper pasted onto board, drawing into the wet paint with a pencil. There is a light, sketch-like touch to all her paintings which conjures up the ephemeral nature of human interaction with nature.As King says, she loves the freedom this surface gives to combine washes and slicks of oil with fluid pencil marks. Having taken a year off when her daughter was born  months ago, the Borders-based painter ed to the easel at the end of last year to transfer a mass of images from her head onto board.It looks effortless, but I am sure it is not. As the painter Francis Bacon once said: ldquoreal painting is a mysterious and continuous struggle with chance.The result is a new body of work which has just gone on show at the at Resipole Studios on the shores of Loch Sunart. I stumbled upon the exhibition, featuring  new paintings , at the end of a lockdown-easing few days on Ardnamurchan. With the gallery having tentatively re-opened two weeks earlier, the exhibition launched without a fanfare, which is in keeping with the unshowy nature of Kingrsquos oeuvre.I first came across the work of King in  at the old Glasgow Art Fair on George Square. I wasnrsquot exactly flush, or in a position to buy a painting, but when I spotted a wee painting by King of a hedgerow in Catterline on Aberdeenrsquos Gallery Heinzel stand, I couldnrsquot resist. I found myself paying up the pound price tag on ten interest-free instalments through the brilliant Own Art scheme. It gives me great joy on a daily basis.King had spent two residencies over subsequent winters at Joan Eardleyrsquos clftop studio, the Watchie in Catterline, and the spirit of the place, which had so inspired Eardley, seeped into her bones. Today, prices for an Anna King painting are considerably more than pound but Irsquod say they are worth every penny. There has been a subtle gear-sht in her approach to subject matter. Where once she looked to wastelands, abandoned buildings and barren pieces of scrub-land, now she is drawn to forestry clear-fell sites near where she lives in a small village on the edge of a community woodland.But nature is not always natural. It can be as industrialised as we humans make it. Many of us have been looking more closely at the world around us in lockdown and, in this body of work, King is ahead of the curve.When I talk to her a few days after seeing her paintings, she tells me about going into her studio as lockdown began. ldquoIn the first few weeks, as spring was about to begin, I wanted to pin down the images of winter trees. I can keep images in my head for a while and I became quite focused on nature taking over after trees had been felled. There are normally big areas in the Borders as there are in other parts of Scotland, but I got interested in lsquoshelter beltsrsquo ndash strips of trees ndash which are there to provide shelter for stock.Although she probably wasnrsquot thinking of Ardnamurchan or the Road to the Isles when she painted this new work, the parallels of the scenery encountered along the way to Loch Sunart are obvious and part of a wider phenomenon in Scotland of nature as industry. As we drove around last week, forests of non-native spruce ndash some felled, some not ndash would regularly hove into view.As King says: ldquoAlthough we often think of any trees as being lsquonaturalrsquo, when it comes to non-native forestry plantations, there is no doubt that this land has been as industrialised as any quarry or built environment.There is an almost post-apocalyptic feel to devastated tracts of nature on our hillsides and Kingrsquos paintings of trees reminded me of the way in which you see a ghostly imprint in your mindrsquos eye when you get an eye-test. ldquoThatrsquos exactly how I see things I want to paint!rsquo she laughs. ldquoWhen I close my eyes, I can see the shape.King, who graduated from Duncan of Jordantsone College of Art in Dundee in , is now in her mid-thirties and having taken a year off from painting seems to have ed with more vigour and focus.ldquoTaking the time out when my daughter was born has been useful, she says. ldquoIrsquove come back more focused with the knowledge that time is precious. Irsquove become more focused on the area local to us here in the Borders. We live on the edge of a community woodland and I find myself constantly looking at shapes, which I can see when my eyes close.ldquoIrsquove never been one for a big splash. I just chip away at the next painting and things change gradually. We have big skies here and lots of light. Therersquos so much to see.There is so much to enjoy and admire in Anna Kingrsquos work. Itrsquos mature and assured without being shouty or trying too hard to own its place in the world. She looks beyond the obvious to make subtle marks which speak about our place in the world ndash and in nature.Anna King Solo, Resipole Studios, Loch Sunart, Acharachle, Argyll, PH HX,  , www.resipolestudios Tue-Sun, am to pm.

A HEROS DEATHDublin post-punk band Fontaines DC set up their stage last year with the release of debut album, Dogrel.Strikingly unapologetic about their identity and relentless in their projections as a side-lined generation, these themes remain heavily resonant in their highly-anticipated follow up, A Heros Death.To some, it may sound a little more polished than its predecessor, but the four-piece have maintained such a high level of artistry within their lyrics - Grian Chatten, the groups vocalist, has previously spoken of the bands common admiration for Irish working class poetry and using this medium, amongst a million musical influences, to sew together masterpiece after masterpiece.Its a very clever album, paying homage to the monotony of the daily grind while giving us glimpses into the untold tales of success that doesnt include how rated you are in terms of wealth and social status.Standout tracks include the album opener I Dont Belong, A Heros Death, Televised Mind and the end song, No.ALANIS MORISSETTE - SUCH PRETTY FORKS IN THE ROADMorissettes ninth studio album Such Pretty Forks In The Road sees the Canadian-American singer-songwriter keeping one hand in her pocket.The opening number, Smiling, was specially written for Morissettes jukebox musical Jagged Little Pill, and deals with the facade we put on for others.Its typical of the rest of the album in that listener walks a tightrope, never knowing whether the tone will veer towards self-deprecating vulnerability or scornful indference.Theres also a musical theatre feeling to Missing The Miracle, which traces the moment where a couple with dfering perspectivessee eye to eye.Nemesis, on the other hand, sees Morissette make a foray into Eurovision territory, with a soaring chorus harking back to her dance roots .Sometimes Morissettes confessional style leads her to some hard-to-stomach choices, such as the pitchy yodelling on Her.Though perhaps we should be thankful: at least its not autotuned!Pretty Forks as a record is not completely downbeat, but when the refrain of Sandbox Love hits, you feel a spark of exuberance missing from the rest of the album.As in the lead single Reasons I Drink, it comes on all familiar in the first few bars, propelled by a great piano hook, but then we settle into a chorus that is disappointingly anonymous, typical of an album that never quite risks soaring to the heights of Ironic or You Oughta Know.STEVE JONES REVIEW NEEDS ADDINGCREEPER - SEX, DEATH  THE INFINITE VOIDSouthamptons Creeper were never a straightforward punk band, but the five-piece have left the genre a long way behind on their second album.Influences include Roy Orbisons widescreen romance, and s glam rock -

VOICESA concept album based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights might sound like a lofty project, but this sort of thing is Max Richters bread and butter.Following on from his recent record Sleep -

Organic beef, lamb, venison and pork from Butchery at Bowhouse, wholemeal organic flours from Scotland the Bread, organic vegetables and salads from East Neuk Market Garden, rums, ciders, beers and natural wines from Futtle Organic Brewery, game meats from Woodmill Game, cheeses from the neighbouring St Andrews Farmhouse Cheese Company, will all be featured.

This landed at the right time for us and we could really focus on this.During lockdown shoppers saw their habits change due to travel restrictions and availability, which gave Bowhouse a chance to introduce itself to new people.Mr Parsons added: ldquoI think two things struck me very early on in lockdown. Meal times became social gatherings and cohesion between families. People became much more interested in their food and there seemed to be a lot of social media around it and families coming together. That was long overdue as we have all been guilty of grab what you can. Where the food came from and who produced it suddenly became important to people.

But despite this, we have continued to operate fully-manned vessels carrying food, medicine, fuel and many other vital supplies our isles communities depend upon.#Councillor Dawson said an appeal for support has already been made and initially turned down by the government.But he says the board are #shocked# and #appalled# that in addition to supporting other Scottish ferry companies, £ million in emergency Scottish Government funding has been handed out to Glasgow Subway and Edinburgh Trams.Orkney Islands Council has long argued that the service should be fully funded by the Scottish Government, in line with similar leline ferry operations where in Scotland.Councillor Dawson added: “That sends a message that the Government considers the wellbeing of people in the Central Belt to be more important than that of folk in Orkney’s North and South Isles.“We are simply asking for parity in the way the company is treated — and that emergency funding is provided, enabling us to continue our support for the many communities that depend on our inter-island ferry service.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Hair and beauty salons reopened on July  with staff wearing personal protective equipmentand customers required to don masks when they turn up for appointments.Hairdresser Andrew Mulvenna says balancing the huge demand from clients for cuts and colours with managing new hygiene regulations has been challenging. It has been a great month and even with the new regulations, we#ve been left feeling very reassured with Christmas levels of busyness which will last into August as we attempt to clear the backlog. The re-opening was pretty hectic and stressful in terms of dealing with the huge volume of phone calls and emails for appointments, he said. Read More Hair we are! NI people who had their lockdown locks transformed after first trip back to hairdresserBy Lauren Harte:Opinion It#s been a long wait, but we can now enjoy some fringe benefits  Face coverings mandatory but some stores say they will not challenge customersEach client has been really happy and offering plenty of elbow bumps which has been the silver lining of our Covid cloud. I think for some they have realised how emotionally rewarding having your hair done can be, he added. Co Armagh stylist and Belfastcolumnist Keris Weir says her Lurgan salon has been working at half capacity and some dficult decisions have had to be made. Obviously the industry is nothing like it was before due to social distancing and all the safety precautions in place. This has dramatically reduced the number of clients we can have in the salon and made appointment times much longer, she said. Previously I had nine chairs and that#s now down to just four while our service menu has also been cut in half. We no longer offer a sole blow dry service and it really saddened me having to make that sacrice given that some of our clients have been with me and my mother before me for over  years.Belfast#s Jason Shankey says while his salons in the city and in Holywood saw a huge surge in business in the first two weeks of reopening, things have now quietened down. Our male business has slowed off more than the female side which continues to be busy as there#s more work involved. However we are hoping for a post pay-day boost from this week on and once more people start going back to work and socialising again, he explained. We haven#t seen the full economy reawakening yet in terms of haircuts but I think there will be a resurgence in people wanting to look good again once things like the furlough scheme ends. Ken McClure from Kenneth Michael Hair and Beauty in east Belfast added: We have been fully booked with a waiting list but we have caught up on the backlog and some gaps are now starting to emerge for those who ring up for appointments. Always in the back of your mind is the threat of another lockdown situation and some clients asked to have quite a bit of their hair taken off in case they don#t get back to us for a while.But Ken, who is also vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, has also received several calls from people raising concerns about some hair salons not using PPE.Most of us are doing everything we can to protect ourselves, our staff and clients by wearing masks, visors, aprons etc While we don#t have any power to do anything about this, we would urge those salons who are not complying with the guidance to please do so for the safety of everyone. If we ever want to get back to normal we all have to do what we can to help stop the spread of the virus, he said. Business has also been booming in the beauty sector with Julie McCay, who runs The Nail Room in Carrickfergus, reporting a crazy few weeks. When we re-opened we were very anxious to ensure that we were following all the procedures correctly but now that we have got into the way of it, it has just become the new #norm#, she said. Thankfully the big demand has been there and we have come to realise just how much our clients appreciate what we do.  Belfast   Related ContentGalleryFashion and Beauty PremiumHair we are!

Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis described the veteran nationalist politician as one of the most signicant architects of the Northern Ireland peace process, and one of the most important figures in recent UK and Irish political history.He looked beyond the violence that was taking place to seek a pathway to peace, said Mr Lewis. Without his leadership and his courage, Northern Ireland would not be where it is today.He reached out to the international community, recognising the value of this engagement. He ensured that world leaders supported the efforts of politicians to underpin the Belfast Agreement, to which he made such a vital contribution. Few people deserved the Nobel Peace Prize more than John - he dedicated his le to peace, and for that the people of Northern Ireland will never forget him.Labour peer and former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain said: His legacy will be a towering place in the history of resolving the conflict on the island of Ireland.US Congressman Richard Neal, chairman of the Friends of Ireland Caucus in the United States Congress, said Mr Hume dedicated his le to peace.Mr Neal added: John Hume dedicated his like to bringing an end to one of the longest and most contentious conflicts in history, and it was fitting that he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his extraordinary efforts. The Irish League of Credit Unions also paid tribute to its former president.John Hume#s sense of social justice, compassion for ordinary people, and his belief in the strength of the cooperative movement was, and is, an inspiration to everyone involved in the credit union movement on the island of Ireland today, it said.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aaaa-cc-d-b-aaede_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aaaa-cc-d-b-aaede_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aaaa-cc-d-b-aaede_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aaaa-cc-d-b-aaede_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aaaa-cc-d-b-aaede_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandChurch and civic leaders pay tribute to John HumeLeaders of the main churches and civic society have paid tribute to the late former SDLP leader John Hume.GalleryNorthern IrelandJohn Hume: Statesman, hero and gentleman... people from the city he loved pay their own tributeIn the city he loved so much, among the people who loved him so much, the sense of sadness and loss was profound.Northern Ireland PremiumEamonn McCannOpinionMy neighbour John Hume changed a great deal by never changing himselfJohn came from along the street where I lived, so I knew of him from an early age as a neighbour.

But he had no money.He and his we, Pat, had five children and all were entirely dependent on her teacher’s salary. Suddenly, he got an invitation to meet one of the most influential Irish-Americans, Senator Ted Kennedy, at the Irish Embassy in Bonn.The credit union loan, appropriately to a man who had championed the foundation of those people’s banks all over Ireland, covered the flight and a hotel room.Read More John Hume #Ireland#s greatest#, says SDLP leader Eastwood following peacemaker#s passing And happily the meeting was a huge success. Ted Kennedy believed John Hume had the formula which could unlock the conflict in Northern Ireland, and he was prepared to use his influence in Washington to put the case to Britain.The story is told in a documentary film “John Hume in America” made in . The documentary drew in a huge range of characters who were at the heart of it all over almost  years.Contributors included two US Presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, two British Prime Ministers, John Major and Tony Blair, the American mediator, George Mitchell, and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern., with Tip OrsquoNeill during his visit to America\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  , with Tip OrsquoNeill during his visit to America\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose, with Tip OrsquoNeill during his visit to America\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features  .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  , with Tip OrsquoNeill during his visit to America\"Skilled politician: former SDLP leader John Hume , with Tip O’Neill during his visit to America FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSkilled politician: former SDLP leader John Hume , with Tip O’Neill during his visit to AmericaThere were also a host of former Irish diplomats whose unsung skills proved vital in the whole -year-long series of interlinked projects.John Hume’s message was deceptively simple: Nothing would be achieved by violence. The people of Ireland were ided – it was not about two pieces of turf. Resolution must begin in NI and the key to any change was the principle of consent.In America this message faced two potent enemies. One enemy was Irish-Americans’ unthinking IRA support, via the “money jar on the bar.”Read More John Hume: From erting off path to priesthood to civil rights campaigner, Good Friday Agreement architect and Nobel laureateThe other, more powerful enemy, was reticence by Washington#s political elite, who accepted that Northern Ireland’s problems were an internal UK matter, and they did not risk irking London by interfering.John Hume set out to change the Washington elite’s view of Northern Ireland as a more urgent but achievable goal.

Photo-Jonathan Porter Presseye.Relatively quickly he succeeded by persuading not just Ted Kennedy, but a host of others including the legendary Tipp O’Neill, as speaker of the House of Representatives, the second most powerful politician in the USA.To paraphrase his long-time colleague the late, Seamus Mallon, John Hume went to where power was and he sought to use all his persuasive powers to influence those with that power.Over a tireless political career, he successfully sold this self-proclaimed “single transferrable speech” in Dublin, Washington, London, and Brussels.Eventually he even sold it, albeit very belatedly, to Sinn Fein and the IRA. There is an interesting contribution from Gerry Adams who admits they wasted years. He does not add that they also wasted thousands of lives.Read More A giant of Irish nationalism: First Minister Foster leads tributes to John HumeJohn Hume himself was too ill to take part in the making of that  film. But it is replete with footage of his memorable comments and assessments.Very striking is his defence of the hugely controversial “Hume-Adams dialogue” in the early s, insisting he was doing it to help save lives, it was no disrespect to IRA victims.There are many other evocative moments, not least Hume’s lament for the dead hunger striker, Bobby Sands, whom he saw as a pawn of both British and IRA propaganda.It was praise indeed to hear the Democratic Unionist Party MP, Geoffrey Donaldson, admit Hume was light years ahead of Unionists in opening up these US contacts.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMargaret Thatcher, former British Prime Minister, on a visit to Belfast. .

Mrs Thatcher chatting with the SDLP leader John Hume.  It was also interesting to note that Margaret Thatcher’s close ally, Lord McAlpine, had said the hardline British Prime Minister lamented agreeing the  Anglo Irish Agreement. But she said the Americans had “made her do it.”This film is not all upbeat achievements, though there are uplting moments. The grim reality of all the reverses, the senseless killing and destruction, are well chronicled via lots of old footage.John Hume worked closely with Dublin, especially the Irish diplomats. But he always argued that Dublin governments had never defined why they wanted from Irish unity.This left unionists to characterise it as “conquest of the north by the south” making unity a dirty word.“Ireland must be one of the few places on earth where people seriously suggest it is wrong to unite people,” John Hume reflected.But for all that John Hume was no saint.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer SDLP PartyLeader John Hume shakes the hand of Seamus Mallon after he ruled himself out for the post of Second Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly and nominated his Deputy Seamus Mallon instead FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer SDLP PartyLeader John Hume shakes the hand of Seamus Mallon after he ruled himself out for the post of Second Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly and nominated his Deputy Seamus Mallon insteadSeamus Mallon, who died this past January, said he could be a dficult person, bad at accepting criticism, and prone to solo runs which disenchanted colleagues.But Mallon’s verdict was unequivocal: “There is a greatness about his political le, what he did, and what he helped to change.

He was a giant of a man who had real passion for this city - both the Waterside and the City side.He had a passion for people and a passion for peace and he was the last great statesman.Graeme Service from Limavady said John Hume will be remembered with affection by both communities.He said: John Hume was a good man who wanted to do the best for people and it didn#t matteryou were a Protestant or a Catholic or anything .He wasn#t overly successful in achieving everything he set out to do, but that wasn#t through any fault of his own.Joe Gallagher said John Hume will always be remembered as a peacemaker.He said: It is such a sad day for the city, it is a big loss for Derry.

Banks didn#t want to know people like us because my father was unemployed, same as the majority of men in this city  years ago, but the credit union would lend money to anybody who was a regular saver.I heard an interview John Hume was giving years and years ago and whoever he was talking to asked him what he considered his greatest achievement and John said it was starting the credit union in Derry.I just thought that showed the calibre of the man John Hume was, he cared so much about the ordinary working class man in the street.Before his illness took a real hold of him, John would walk around these streets and everybody knew he wasn#t well but they looked out for him, made sure he was okay.John Hume helped Derry#s people through their most dficult days. In his latter days, its people looked after him.And now they will never forget him.Belfast Most Read#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittRow over same-sex wedding ultimatum letter sent to NI churchesFather of boy killed by bomb angry as MP whose former party #defended# IRA given peerageIan Paisley prays for Sinn Fein chief Michelle O#Neill and hails Martin McGuinness for respect he showed to his dadKKK pic loyalist on coke charge after police sting,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The retained version of the regulation, and the subject of this consultation, will apply in Great Britain only, the paper stated.It is unclear what impact the new rules will have on businesses and customers, with potential iations in consumer demand and the circumstances of inidual manufacturers.

Every news agency in Europe mourns his death and John Hume#s name will join the list of great Irish leaders for posterity.And yet, for many people under , there may not be the true understanding of his le#s work that he deserves.John#s extended illness took him from the public space for too long. It would be a fitting tributethe global response to his death prompted a new examination of his le.Such was his towering contribution to Irish society, that it may well be impossible to properly express the scale and signicance of his work.In a dark and worsening conflict, where sectarianism, hatred and bitterness threatened to banish forever the hope of better days, John Hume stood as a beacon. His philosophy was simple but revolutionary. He understood and distilled the roots of a conflict that had blighted our country and our relationship with Britain for centuries.With single-minded determination he promoted that philosophy relentlessly.Respect for dference, the importance of shared institutions, the three strands of relationships - within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between East and West, the primacy of human rights to these political foundation stones that are now almost universally accepted without question, John Hume taught us the way.To his core, John believed in the dignity of every human being.It was what propelled him into community activism. It saw him become a driving force in the Credit Union movement, working to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation in Derry and across the North.Understanding at first hand the importance of education in improving le prospects, he was a lelong champion of education.He loved Derry from the bottom of his heart and Derry loved him. No matter where his work took him, he never lost his connection with his home place.And as the situation got worse, he looked farther and farther afield for help.He knew we couldn#t fix the mess we were in on our own and he built an international coalition of interested parties that was unprecedented in scope and influence. In the United States and in Europe, he brought the Irish conflict to the very top table and gave everyone a stake in finding peace.To this day, the deep affection and support that Ireland enjoys in Brussels and Washington DC is in part a legacy of the work of John Hume.He didn#t do it on his own.His successor as SDLP leader and MP for Foyle, Colum Eastwood put it well when paying tribute on Monday. He said #There was no John Hume without Pat Hume#.This is true.Pat#s dedication and support during his active career and her unfailing care during his retirement and ill health is central to his story and his success.In a very real way, John Hume saved this country. He saved us from a descent into hopelessness and hatred.He saved us from a conflict that had held us back for centuries.Ten years ago, the Irish people recognised this when they voted him #Ireland#s Greatest# in an RTÉ series of that name.It was a fitting tribute.When historians stand back and survey the long arc of Anglo Irish relations, when they see how close we came to the abyss in the s and s, and when they look at what this man did and how his philosophy transformed relationships, I am confident that #Ireland#s Greatest# is also a tribute that will stand the test of time.Micheal Martin is Taoiseach  Belfast   Most Read#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittRow over same-sex wedding ultimatum letter sent to NI churchesFather of boy killed by bomb angry as MP whose former party #defended# IRA given peerageIan Paisley prays for Sinn Fein chief Michelle O#Neill and hails Martin McGuinness for respect he showed to his dadKKK pic loyalist on coke charge after police sting,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thank you from a grateful generation. Our leader always. However, the Hume legacy spread far beyond his native city, drawing tributes yesterday from around the world.Mr Clinton said: Through his faith in principled compromise, and his ability to see his adversaries as human beings, John helped forge the peace that has held to this day.He added: His legacy will live on in every generation of Northern Ireland#s young people who make John#s choice, to live free of the hatred and horror of sectarian violence.Mr Blair, another architect of the peace process, said: John Hume was a political titan a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

He pulled off a coup by adding Tyrone coach Gavin Devlin to a management team that includes his cousin Seamus Bradley and long-serving player Padriacuteg Kelly, who has also spent time as a senior selector. Coleraine ended their hopes for five-in-a-row and they were beaten by neighbours Glen in last years semi-final. His new captain Karl McKaigue could be set for a y spell on the sidelines after an Achilles injury in Sundays hurling victory over Ballinascreen. googletag.cmd.push Padraig Cassidy was hampered with injury during the county season, but apart from McKaigues injury the Slaughtneil boss reported a full hand to select from. He has been handed a defensive boost. Paul McNeill has ed after a troublesome shoulder injury, while there is also ato full fitness of goalkeeper Antoacutein McMullan and the versatile Barry McGuigan has emerged from retirement. Former winning captains Patsy Bradley and Francis McEldowney continue to squeeze every last drop from their stellar careers. They open their account against a Kilrea side, who are in their second season under manager Declan Bradley. The Pearses will look to the experience of Brian Oacuteg McAlary, James and Charlie Kielt to lead their youthful side, who are looking to build over the next five seasons from their recent minor winning team, who were pipped in the U final. googletag.cmd.push Larry Kielt is back in training after a cruciate ligament injury, but this first game may come too soon for his . Brian Oacuteg McAlaryand Peadar McLaughlinwill need assessed this week before Bradley makes his selection. In attack Daithi McLaughlin has been a ray of light for Kilrea and he will need support from Paddy Quigg. Three players pushing for the team are Daniel Madden, PJ McAleese and Odhran McLarnon. It is a tough opener for them and its hard to see them turning over an Emmets team looking to launch a title bid.

Kevin Brady, who played a cameo junior football role for Ogra Colmcille two seasons ago, has joined him after helping St Marys Magherafelt to MacRory Cup success. Other than a game with St Eunans, Bradley has tried in vain to get any more challenge games to put any stamp on his side, which has kept the same personnel as recent seasons. Paul Young will miss the game due to work commitments in England, while defender Connor McVey and Roddy OKane are struggling with injury. On the plus side, Derry player Jason Rocks is on his way back and could see action by the end of the group stages. googletag.cmd.push Bellaghy have John McKeever at the helm this season, who has Leo Meenan in as coach with former minor selector Kieran Glackin on board and provides a vital link to the upcoming talents from their underage production line. With goalkeeper Benny Diamond stepping aside, one of McKeevers first tasks was to find a replacement. Former Derry minor list Peter Stuart, who is an accomplished kicker, has been moulded into the role and is set to start against Loup. The Tones, under Chairman Kevin Doherty, followed the lockdown to the letter of the law, but got a few challenge games in to help prepare them. googletag.cmd.push Conan Brown hasnt came out this year and another player who wont feature is Conor Quinn, who has suffered a nasty knee injury. Lorcan Spier will miss the first two games with a suspension carried over from last season. McKeever will need to keep captain Eoghan Brown fit, who will form a partnership with the highly rated Paul Cassidy, their Ulster minor winning captain, who has recovered from injury. Along with Ronan McFaul, Odhran Lee and Conan Milne, they could be set to make their debuts in a youthful Bellaghy team, who will look to Gerard ONeill and Ryan McNally, with Peter Cassidy and Declan Brown also having championship experience.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

The Bridge played Kilrea and Steelstown to finalise their preparations, getting away from the in-house scenarios to embed the new rules in the minds. Like many clubs, training has been well attended and Conlan cant ask much more from his squad, who he feels have an exciting future ahead. Michael ONeill remains between the posts, with their defence built around skipper Nathan Rocks, who has had his injury problems, and brothers Paudi and Conor McGrogan. googletag.cmd.push At midfield, Michael Bateson and Conor Doherty are the likely pairing. They will have Peter and Mark McGrogan in an attack that also includes Jude Diamond and Danny Mulholland. Another option will be Conor McAteer, who had an impressive school season with St Pius and will be looking to push on. Conlan and selector Ryan McElhone will have a familiar face along the line in Ballinderry man Philip Muldoon, who coaches Foreglen under manager Damian OConnor. They wont be able to call on Shane and Ruairi Duffy. The brothers both travelled home from London all through last years championship campaign, but have remained with Fulham Irish this season. googletag.cmd.push Foreglen, one of the clubs to suspend their activities due to the Covid- scare, ed to training last Tuesday. They also played Steelstown and Limavady, but have been hit with injuries worries. Muldoon, who says the they are going to throw the shackles off and play without pressure, ruled out Conrad Sheerin with a hamstring injury. There are doubts over Ciaraacuten McFeelyand John Duffy .

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They say that this will build on the excellent work already begun by the North West Greenway Network team in conjunction with Derry City  Strabane District Council, and will play a major role in the economic regeneration of the towns and villages along the routes, such as Carrigans, Castlefinn, Lford, Clonmany, Ballylfin, Carndonagh and Quigleys Point. The specic allocations are as follows Inishowen Greenway - Section: Buncrana to Carndonagh Section googletag.cmd.push Allocation for   -€,. Inishowen Greenway - Section: Muff to Quigley’s Point Section Allocation for   - €,. Carrigans to Castlefinn Greenway - Section: link between Castlefin and the Foyle Valley Greenway. Allocation for   - €,.  With more people riding bikes and walking with the onset of the Covid pandemic, this type of infrastructure will also help to promote physical fitness, improve mental health and reduce our carbon emissions. Donegal County Council is very proactive with its partners to address all of these issues and this funding will make it safer to cycle and walk in our county. Going forward, the council will consider potential route options and will engage in a consultation process, similar to the process that is delivering the greenway connections from Buncrana to Derry and Muff to Derry respectively. googletag.cmd.push All these routes tie in with other strategic council projects, most notably the EU-funded Riverine and North West Greenway Network projects. While all of Donegal’s applications to DTTaS were not successful, the council is currently progressing its greenway and cycling strategy, and central to this strategy will be the routes outlined above as well as the planning of greenways linking Ballybofey to Donegal town and Letterkenny to Burtonport. It is proposed to bring this draft strategy before members later this year. With national government committed to spending % of the total transport capital budget for cycling projects and an allocation of % of the total capital budget for pedestrian infrastructure, the council is optimistic that many of our countywide projects – including the Barnesmore Gap and Burtonport greenways – will be advanced in the coming years.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The former Chester and Maidenhead forward, who missed the defeat to Sligo Rovers at the weekend, opened the scoring at the start of the second half, after which captain Conor McCormack sealed the points with his first goal for the club in over four years. This was a much-improved Derry City display as they showed more hunger and desire and ultimately more threat against a St. Pat’s team who thoroughly disappointed. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine made three changes to the team which wilted against Sligo Rovers, Colm Horgan and Jack Malone starting, whilst James Akintunde made his Candystripes debut. For St. Pat’s, there was a debut for former City player and recent target Georgie Kelly, with the hosts looking to build on their impressive performance and result against Dundalk. There was a lively start from both teams with Robbie Benson bringing a good save from Pater Cherrie with an effort from  yards, before Gerardo Bruna tested Brendan Clarke from a similar distance. At the other end, all eyes were on Akintunde on his debut and whilst the first  minutes passed him by, he was heavily involved in creating a chance for his team when he worked his way in from the right before finding Conor McCormack, who set up Joe Thomson for a curling -yard shot which just ailed wide of Brendan Clarke’s upright. googletag.cmd.push Walter Figueira came even closer just minutes later, collecting the ball  yards from goal before trying an ambitious effort which had Clarke scrambling across his goal before it flashed just wide of the post. The second half began perfectly for Derry City who took the lead with their first serious attack. Colm Horgan did well to bring the ball down the right and he fed the supporting Jack Malone, who placed a low cross into the heart of the penalty area where James Akintunde was on hand to direct the ball past Clarke and into the net for a debut goal. The next goal in this one was so important and it went the way of the visitors who punished a St. Pat’s mistake ruthlessly. Luke McNally gave the ball away deep in his own half and Figueira latched onto it before driving towards goal. The City playmaker got in the vicinity of the Pat’s area before leaving it for Conor McCormack, the midfielder skilfully curling the ball around Brendan Clarke and into the corner from  yards to double his team’s lead with just over  minutes remaining. City held firm in the closing stages to give them three very valuable points ahead of the weekend game against league leaders Shamrock Rovers. Teams ST. PATRICK’S ATHLETIC: Clarke, Titov , Desmond, McNally, Feely, Grfin, Benson, Gibson , Lennon , Ward , Kelly .  DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Horgan, Toal, Gilchrist, Coll, Malone , Thomson, McCormack, Bruna , Figueira, Akintunde .

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care home.Residents say while this section of road is governed by a mph limit, very few drivers adhere to it with the speed of many vehicles which use the road described as ldquofrightening.PSNI traffic officers are periodically deployed to the Strangford Road and while their presence is welcomed, residents believe thatthe new speed indicator sign needs to be relocatedis to be effective.Last week, a call was issued to Downpatrick area councillors to meet with PCSP officials to discuss the location of the speed indicator sign and press for it to be moved back as far as the entrance to Lecale Park.Residents say that speeding has been a major issue along the Strangford Road for many years and that there have been several accidents. Concern has also been expressed about the safety of pedestrians who walk in this popular area.Some Strangford Road residents say they cannot understand why the new speed indicator sign is policing just a short section of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads and has not been placed ahead of the approach to a number of large housing areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Murlough club celebrates  ","story":"MURLOUGH ACrsquos annual awards night was very dferent this year.Prize winners were presented with their awards on Saturday at a less formal and socially distanced outdoors event.It was a great way for them to celebrate the running achievements of everyone from   before lockdown occurred.The award winners have shown commitment to their running and to the club in the respective categories.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11655756.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Air ambulance takes motorcyclist to hospital after serious RTCSadness as funeral of popular Co Armagh woman takes place todayNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
