Also, Covid-19 vaccine trials involved the same rigorous testing.” What about potential long-term side effects? How effective are the vaccines? The most recent study on the effect of vaccines from Public Health England (PHE) shows that vaccines provide a high level of protection – they decrease your risk of catching Covid-19, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment as well as the number of people who die from Covid-19. Can the two doses be mixed and matched? “Because the trials were done using the same vaccine, we’re asking people to have their second dose using the same brand,” says Hussain. A £7m trial was recently launched to examine whether combining jabs could provide better protection. Having your second dose is really important when the time comes. The first dose of the vaccine provides a high level of protection, but for that protection to last longer, everyone needs to get a second dose. Are the vaccines safe for those with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or asthma? Yes, says Hussain, who notes the vaccines have been stringently tested on those with underlying illnesses. “It’s important that people with long-term health conditions receive the vaccine because they’re often more at risk of getting Covid-19,” she says. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had previously advised against anyone with a history of anaphylaxis – a life-threatening reaction caused by allergens – getting the vaccine. However, it has since revised its guidelines to reflect that the vaccine is mostly safe for people who have been affected by anaphylaxis, except those iniduals who have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients or if they experience anaphylaxis after the first dose. The MHRA’s current guidance is based on detailed analysis of data up to 7 February 2021. At this date, an estimated 7.5m first doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine and 5m doses of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine had been administered, and around 500,000 second doses, mostly the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, had been administered. Can I have the vaccine if I am taking other medicines? Most medicines will not be a problem if taken alongside the Covid vaccine, but anyone in doubt should check with their GP. Patients who are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin, apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran can receive the vaccine, provided their treatment is stable and they do not have unexplained bruising or bleeding. Are the Covid-19 vaccines safe for people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities? Yes, the vaccines are safe. Hussain says she’s encountered vaccine hesitancy from some patients. “It’s for a variety of reasons, ranging from a historical mistrust of authorities to concerns about animal products,” she says. Is the vaccine halal? “I have South Asian patients worried about the vaccines containing animal products, but there are none in there,” says Hussain. She also notes that both the Muslim Council of Britain and the British Islamic Medical Association endorse the vaccine. What is the most common myth you encounter about the vaccine? Can I still take the vaccine if I’m breastfeeding? I am young and fit, so therefore less likely to die from Covid-19. Why should I get the jab? The vaccine is currently being offered to people in high priority groups, but will soon be available for young people. With this in mind, Hussain says: “It’s true younger people are less likely to die from Covid-19, but we’re seeing more examples of long Covid in young people, a horrid illness that damages organs. Receiving the vaccine will protect you from that.” More than half the UK’s adult population has now been vaccinated. This achievement is testament to the efforts of the NHS and GPs around the country, but it is crucial that everyone gets a vaccine when their time comes. Are the Covid vaccines safe for children? Neither the PfizerBioNTech or OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines are licensed for under-16-year-olds, says Hussain, because trials remain in progress. However, for a very small number of children at a higher risk of catching the virus and serious illness, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that vaccination can be appropriate, but that this should be a carefully discussed decision between parentss and their GP. Do I still need to get the vaccine if I’ve already had Covid-19? Yes. “We really don’t know how long immunity lasts after you’ve been infected with Covid-19,” says Hussain, who also points out the rise of new variants. “People who have been previously infected may still catch these variants, but it’s believed the vaccines can offer some protection against them.” How long am I immunised for after receiving the vaccine? “My feeling is it won’t be a once-in-a-lifetime jab,” says Hussain. “It could be a seasonal jab, like the annual booster flu injections.” I’ve got vaccine-sceptical family members. How can I persuade them to take the vaccine? “Remember: there’s probably a very good reason for your family member being reluctant,” says Hussain. “So, first of all – and this is what I’m doing with my patients – listen to them. Try to explore their reasons. Also, get them to speak to another person, such as a friend or family member, who’s had the jab. This makes it more real.” If anybody needs more reassurance on the vaccine, Hussain suggests discussing these with your GP, practice nurse, or even your high-street chemist. “Everybody ought to have questions during this scary time – it’s exactly what people like me are here for,” she says. Marsha McAdam is a mental health advocate living in Manchester. She hopes the vaccine will enable her to resume the volunteering work that helps her manage her borderline personality disorder The footage of intensive care units (ICU) featuring PPE-clad staff lifting patients and machines bleeping eerily away were among the most harrowing scenes from the pandemic. For Marsha McAdam, it was terrifying, bringing back painful memories of being on an ICU unit herself for three weeks after taking a near-fatal overdose. Since her 2008 overdose, McAdam, who has borderline personality disorder, has managed her condition through mentalisation-based therapy and volunteering for the initiative Equally Well. But the horrors of the pandemic combined with shielding (McAdam has fibromyalgia and type 2 diabetes) has put her mental health at risk. “If it wasn’t for carers visiting twice a day, and my son, I wouldn’t see anybody.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Especially when armed with budget-friendly homeware collections, such as the take on 2021’s biggest decor trends from Marks \u0026amp Spencer. “If you’re keen to refresh tired decor without creating too much work for yourself, the best place to start for a quick win is a fresh lick of paint,” says Alexandra Laird, interior design manager at the Burbeck Group. But you don’t have to stop there. “If replacing furniture is over budget, bright accessories and artwork can be easily added to a room to bring in some new colour.” “A key trend that’s easy to implement on a moderate budget right now would be a modern minimalist look with a Scandi furniture scheme. Use a neutral palette with pops of bright colour added through your furnishings and artwork throughout,” she adds. Make a start by lifting your living room with an emerald green sofa scattered with ochre cushions, or brighten up the bedroom by mixing soft grey bedding with rugs and throws in ocean blue and vibrant mustard. “Keep the rest of the room fairly neutral as a backdrop to really make your bold and bright colours sing,” says Kate Hatherell, founder of the Interior Designers Hub. A simple glass-topped coffee table, for example, is a perfect finisher – style and function without adding to the noise. If you’re looking for a softer palette that’ll calm, start with neutral colours to set the tone. This year’s shades – cream, grey, navy, duck egg, soft pink – all work well together and have the added benefit of timeless appeal. “A good way to add some warmth to neutral shades without disrupting that feeling of calm would be clever use of lighting,” says Laird. “Use table lamps and floor lamps in the corners of a room to add a cosy feel. I’d also bring in textured or warm coloured throws and cushions to maximise that feeling further. Again, you can play around with artwork and soft furnishings to add in warm colourings where needed.” Carry the same peaceful palette into the bedroom with a watercolour bedspread and crisp white linen. A top tip: natural wood accents complement almost all colour combos and, according to interior designer Katharine Pooley, also tick the box for this year’s rustic-inspired trend. “Embracing traditional interiors can help to create a comfortable atmosphere, even if your home is newly-built and therefore perhaps lacks more historical features,” she says. Try rustic-look furniture such as an oak-topped coffee table, or maximise the light with a metal lampshade. If the rustic look isn’t for you, how about heritage inspired classics reimagined for today? We’re talking modern use of colour, and striking scale and pattern. From Pinterest to the high street, you’ll see myriad nods to elegant florals, rich botanical prints, plush fabrics and plenty of polished glassware. Carrying on the taste for vintage twists, art deco references are also back on trend. Looking forward to inviting friends and family over for dinner again? Now’s the time to spruce up your glassware, or add an ornate mirrored tray to your drinks cabinet. Heading down the vintage decor route does come with a warning from the experts, however. “Be careful when working with vintage-inspired pieces that you don’t aim to simply reproduce the era,” says Pooley. Laird agrees that you’ll want to keep things on the right side of Gatsby-era with this trend. “The best way to stop the room from looking too old fashioned and keep it modern is to use contemporary key pieces of furniture, such as the sofa in the lounge, or the bedroom setup, and then add vintage-inspired lamps, accessories and artwork around this,” she advises. Nail it with tactile textures such as Egyptian cotton, luxury velvet and smooth sateen, and sprinkle in a few delightfully retro nods such as cotton velvet cushions, butterfly or hummingbird details and marble accents.

Photograph: Nick BradshawSome teachers felt pressure from their schools and parents to inflate students\u0027 Leaving Cert marks during last year’s calculated grades process, according to a new study.The findings are contained in a preliminary survey of more than 700 secondary teachers who were involved in last year’s calculated grades process, which required teachers to assess their own pupils for State certification for the first time.The DCU report shows the vast majority of teachers – 87 per cent – expressed confidence in their professional judgements and felt they were fair to their students.However, one in three – just over 250 respondents – commented on how the calculated process made them feel such as the stress of ranking their own students, bias on the part of their colleagues and tension over whether to inflate grades.Some teachers reported feeling under pressure when meeting students’ parents out shopping or from school management to “juice up” pupils’ estimated marks during the grading process.One teacher commented that a student’s parents had not spoken to them since the results because they believed their child was awarded an “unfair” grade.In another case, a teacher said their school management “failed the integrity test” when overseeing grades, while another pointed to “grotesque” levels of grade inflation.“There were unconscionable interventions on behalf of school management to juice up the numbers too – teachers were asked to ‘find grades’ that could be moved up. Nothing was moved down,” wrote another teacher.RegretSome teachers expressed regret over not giving higher estimated marks and said they would intentionally inflate their students’ marks in calculated grades applied in future.“I have a very fair and honest judgement of what my students would have achieved if they had sat the Leaving Cert and my students were downgraded... if this happens again, I would have to inflate my grades too so as not to disadvantage my students,” one wrote.Another commented: “I am annoyed that I didn’t inflate the grades as obviously as other teachers in the country were doing this. I feel my students were unfairly disadvantaged.”The DCU report, by academics Audrey Doyle, Zita Lysaght and Michael O’Leary, found many teachers identified challenges in areas such as decision-making around marks at grade boundaries, combining assessment data, reconciling inconsistencies in student performance and maintaining an unbiased position with respect to inidual students.For example, 38 per cent of teachers said they found it difficult to remain unbiased when marking their students’ workEven though some respondents voiced concerns about how school colleagues arrived at their decisions, most believed that meetings held to align marks between colleagues teaching the same subject in inidual schools worked well.While many respondents said they would not engage in a calculated grades process in the future, others indicated overall satisfaction with the process in the context of exceptional circumstances and highlighting the potential benefits it offered some students.Opinion was sharply ided on the extent to which the calculated grade experience would inform efforts to reform the senior cycle.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Aspects of Bill \u0026lsquonot scientifically well grounded\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoentirely lacking in legal certainty\u0026rsquoSector supports 5,000 jobs now and this will rise to 7,000 by 2030, according to dispatchProven technology emits little or no greenhouse gas"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Urban gulls must be Ireland\u0026rsquos most hated bird, seen as food thieves and noisy nesters"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 325,243 had received their second dose.Some 192,095 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 347,313 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 478,879 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp76,331 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 800 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 dancing in car park as 40 somethings get vaccinated in north","story":"Freya McClements after getting the AstraZeneca vaccine   in Belfast.The newly vaccinated are easily identifiable thanks to their broad grins and Department of Health information leaflets. As they reunite with loved ones outside the SSE Arena in Belfast, their delight only becomes more intense. A couple grasp each other’s hands tightly, wordlessly, while those who are alone take out their phones and make a call. One woman even dances across the car park. “This is safety”, is how one person describes it for others, it is “freedom” and “hope”. It feels like all those things. On Thursday, I joined almost 850,000 others in the North who have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. A “big birthday” earlier this year made me just old enough to qualify for the latest rollout of the vaccine in Northern Ireland, which last week was extended to everyone aged between 40 and 45. At the SSE Arena – which opened as the North’s first mass vaccination centre on March 29th – most of the people queuing for their injections are around that age 14,000 of us booked appointments in the first two hours the system was operational last week. Pop-up cubiclesThe last time I was here was for a Killers concert now, the people checking bags at the door have been replaced by stewards who check photo IDs and make sure everyone sanitises their hands. Stickers on the floor mark out socially distanced queues, and lead to the arena floor (once the way in for people with standing tickets). It resembles a field hospital. Rows of pop-up vaccination cubicles are lined up on the arena floor I make my way from the check-in desk to a booth where a doctor takes me through a list of medical questions. I am to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. Unlike in the Republic where its use has been limited to the over 60s because of concerns over rare blood clots, in the North it remains in use for people over 30. The doctor is more than happy to talk this through, and to explain the data behind it the UK authorities’ view is that the benefits far outweigh any risks. In the next booth I finally see the vial containing the vaccine. The needle is in my arm almost before I realise it the injection no more than the “slight scratch” the doctor promises. How lucky I amI wait for the required 15 minutes on one of the chairs laid out like a school classroom at exam time, facing what was once the stage above us, a large dashboard keeps a running total of the number of vaccines administered. D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better is blasting from the speakers. I am well aware of how lucky I am. Friends and family in the North are already discussing the prospect of “getting back to normal”, and the announcement of significant easing of lockdown restrictions has only added to the sense that, to quote Northern Ireland’s Minister for Health, the “scales are tipping”. “Our parents have all had it, now we’re all getting it so we can all meet as a family again at some stage,” explains Lynn Connolly from Saintfield, Co Down, who also received her vaccine on Thursday. “It’s about freedom,” says Chris McMonagle from Derry. “The sooner everyone gets vaccinated, the better.”“I feel privileged to get it,” emphasises Stephen Laughlin from Belfast. “There are so many around the world who have no chance of getting it any time soon, particularly in underdeveloped countries.” Yet friends and colleagues of the same age and older who live on the other side of the Border cannot yet imagine even the prospect of getting the vaccine in France, my 72-year-old mother is still waiting.

But, in fact, the GDPR only allows for a limited and purpose-based exemption,” he said.This is likely to be one of a range of issues that the Data Protection Commissioner will want to address in correspondence with Sinn Féin.One of the first questions that will likely be asked will be the legal basis that the party is relying on to operate the system. It is understood the office is also particularly interested in the issue of user consent and knowledge.Last week, the Sunday Independent reported that party officials are being told to use personal information posted on social media to identify voters’ home addresses.‘Facebook is king’Members are told “Facebook is king” and members should elicit more information from users so they can “tag them as social media engaged and follow up with a canvass on their doorstep”, according to an internal document.This is another area the Data Protection Commissioner will explore in these preliminary talks with Sinn Féin, with questions likely around how it uses the data and if users are aware how their public data is being processed. A decision on whether a further investigation is needed could come as early as next week.The  also asked Sinn Féin where exactly in the EU the database is hosted but the party declined to answer.“All data is stored on servers based in the EU and handled in accordance with GDPR. We have received correspondence from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to this and we look forward to engaging with them,” a spokesman said.Liz Carolan, an executive director with Digital Action, said the lack of clarity around the issue shows the need for an electoral commission.“This type of campaign technology is in widespread use in lots of parts of the world, and it was only a matter of time before it became a part of politics in Ireland. The issue here is that we haven’t planned for it, established if and how we want it to be used, and set up consistent rules for transparency and for what can and can’t be done,” she said.Campaign tech could help with voter engagement and mobilisation, but there was far greater potential for misuse than in traditional campaigning, she noted.“It is also often not transparent by default, like door-knocking or posters are, and parties naturally enough won’t want to give away their trade secrets in an election unless they are compelled to. As it stands, expenditure and activity outside of Ireland doesn’t fall under electoral rules, which isn’t practical in a digital age,” Ms Carolan added."},{"url":null,"title":"republic uk and eu agree to tackle northern ireland unrest","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures.  Brussels, London and Dublin agreed to work together towards solutions following unrest in Northern Ireland.The agreement was reached in a series of meetings on Thursday aimed at putting relations on a “constructive” footing after a difficult start for the North’s post-Brexit arrangements.European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and his British counterpart Lord David Frost held a dinner meeting in Brussels intended to provide “a political steer for follow-up discussions that will take place between both teams”, said a commission spokesman.It came as the British and Irish governments agreed to a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in the coming months to discuss issues of concern in Northern Ireland.“We haven’t agreed a date yet but certainly I think the governments are in agreement that there should be a BIIGC meeting and I think we’ll continue to talk about the appropriate time for that,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told The . Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis earlier this week dismissed the idea that the intergovernmental conference should meet to discuss recent unrest in the North, on the grounds that policing is among the powers devolved to Stormont. The intergovernmental conference was established under the Belfast Agreement as a forum for co-operation between the two governments on Northern Ireland. It has not met since Boris Johnson became British prime minister.Mr Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures including Lord Frost, in what Mr Coveney described as “a very good meeting . . . on a personal level” and “a good, honest engagement that explored in some detail some of the issues in terms of what’s possible and what’s not”.Brussels and London remain far apart on some issues, with Britain seeking flexibility while the commission has said pragmatic solutions can be found only if the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented fully. The European Parliament has yet to ratify the EU-UK trade deal, which is in place provisionally until the end of the month. The leader of the largest political group in the parliament, Manfred Weber, called on the commission to “convincingly demonstrate how it will ensure that London will remain faithful to the treaty”.

Why? Because the concept of “owning” a cat isn’t as straightforward as a non-cat person might assume.My own childhood cat, Ivy, was the most adored family pet imaginable. When our previous beloved tabby died, we spent weeks hunting for the perfect replacement – finally hitting gold with a gorgeous and rare ginger female. Off we trekked to a breeder in the middle of nowhere, brimming with ideas for names and squabbling about whose bedroom the new kitten would share.We bustled our new addition off to be microchipped as soon as we got her home, and spent the next few years showering her in love and Sheba. Every time she dropped a bloody, decapitated mouse on the cream carpet, we warmly congratulated her ingenuity.We were, in short, the perfect owners. But we were not enough for our darling Ivy.Then one day, when we were tearing our hair out over a particularly lengthy absence, we got a call from some neighbours a few doors down. A ginger cat, a smart older gentleman awkwardly informed us, had moved in with him a few months ago. According to the local vet, she was ours.Off we went to collect the cat we had bought and raised, only to find her curled up and purring her heart out on this stranger’s lap, resolutely refusing to meet our eyes.Ivy – later rechristened Mimi – lived out the rest of her days with the couple, a retired judge, it transpired, and his beautiful French wife. My parents got a new cat, Holly, who, God bless her, has graciously accepted her role as family pet and seems in no hurry to upgrade us.In the eyes of Government ministers, cats may be possessions – to be bought, chipped, and owned.

Despite his translation to the Lords, the straight-talking northerner appears charmingly unspoilt by progress. Pickles, now chair of the “drain the swamp” watchdog, Acoba, has the task of vetting ministers and senior civil service mandarins’ new jobs. And as he gave evidence to the public administration committee about Whitehall lobbying allegations, the Sleazebuster-in-Chief proved he’s lost none of his common touch – nor his air of unassailable probity. Granted, the title “Lord Pickles” took some getting used to – it’s the sort of innately ridiculous name you’d give a pampered lapdog or pet hamster. So too did his jewellery both hands were weighed down with gold rings so chunky they’d have looked at home in a 50 Cent video or an episode of the Sopranos. Lord Pickles may be the Eliot Ness of lobbying, but his bling screamed Al Capone. Disembodied behind a single Zoom screen, his numerous chins congregated in a pleasing mass of dimpled pink flesh. At times of frustration, he’d glower indignantly, like an aggrieved Humpty-Dumpty at lighter moments he’d morph into something jollier – a well-upholstered version of Caspar the Friendly Ghost, oozing stolidity and calm. “I think by character I’m not very needy”, he confessed at one point. “You sometimes get these people in politics who just want the Prime Minister to know what they’re doing – I’ve never had that desire.” Silly questions were invariably met with a simple “yes” or “no”, a rarity among today’s politicians who prefer to begin every answer with some variation on a theme of “Well look” or “We’ve been very clear...”But as any TV interviewer will tell you, monosyllabic replies can be used with devastating effect, taking the wind out of the inquisitor’s sails and rocking him back on his heels while he desperately tries to dream up a supplementary question. Lord Pickles proved a master of the technique, which at times made for awkward viewing, as his questioners scrambled to respond and their remarks appeared ludicrous in the stilted silence that followed.“But as we said, there are boundaries because we’re all adhering to the Nolan principles which have been with us for a couple of decades,” said Karin Smyth of Labour.“So do you think there are more steps that we need to take to address the culture?”“What do you think they’re going to be?”“I think I’ve already explained them in quite a bit of detail.”The most damning statements were issued with deadpan calm, all the more effective for its understatement. “It has not been clear where the boundaries lay”, he said of the relationship between private sector and civil service. “In fact, I hope this doesn’t appear rude, there doesn’t appear to be any boundaries at all”. His questioners listened with growing interest to the number of potential conflicts of interest which had never been brought to Acoba’s attention.Barely had he touched on the employment of a top civil servant by Greensill when Lord Pickles was suddenly trolled by his own virtual home assistant. “Hmm, I don\u0027t know that one”, chimed in Alexa, speaking for many viewers – and, it seems, for Acoba itself.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame cathedral must reopen planned 2024 says macron","story":"Two years after the iconic Paris cathedral of Notre-Dame was partially destroyed in a huge cloud of fire and smoke, French president Emmanuel Macron has urged workers to help him hit a tough target for reopening in 2024.“We\u0027re seeing here how, in two years, a huge job has been accomplished,” Mr Macron said as he climbed to the roof of the 13th-century edifice, now a construction site filled with scaffolding, nets and tarpaulin.“We are also looking to the three coming years because we will have to meet our targets, and therefore there is a great mobilisation of very demanding and rigorous planning,” he told construction workers and architects.Mr Macron is under pressure to meet an ambitious target for reopening he set in the immediate aftermath of the fire which sent shockwaves through France and the world in 2019.He had then promised the reconstruction would be complete by the summer of 2024, when the Olympics will be hosted by the French capital. A year later, he reiterated that promise despite the coronavirus pandemic halting progress for months.The fire also spread out large amounts of toxic lead on to Notre Dame and the surrounding area, sparking months of clean-up work before restoration efforts could start. Further delays were caused by bad weather, and officials now say the cathedral will be ready for worship on April 16, 2024, five years after the blaze, but reconstruction work, pictured below, will have to continue beyond that date.“The goal is to celebrate a service in 2024. Which does not mean that everything will be finished, far from it,” Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former general handpicked by Mr Macron to oversee the reconstruction, told French radio.“We will meet the deadline. We are reaching a critical point in the construction work, the end of the securing phase,” he added, although admitting it would require working at unprecedented speed.It is unclear whether worshippers will have a roof over their heads during the planned 2024 service, or whether the cathedral will be ready to host some of the 20 million tourists it welcomed each year before the fire.After the initial phase of preventing the building from collapsing is complete, the reconstruction work is expected to begin in late 2021. Officials say it could be another 20 years before it is fully complete. In 2019, firemen narrowly managed to save the 600-year-old Gothic cathedral after the spire collapsed and much of the roof was destroyed.More than 340,000 people, from the billionaire owners of French luxury brands Chanel and Dior to regular citizens from France and beyond, raised over €800 million (£694 million) after the tragedy to fund the restoration. All the funds will be needed, and the restoration team is still looking for donations, fearing they will dry out too soon.Earlier this year, French forest experts also selected and cut down 1,000 oak trees from 200 French forests to rebuild the spire exactly as it was designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century.After the fire, Mr Macron suggested the 96m (315ft) spire could be replaced since it was not a part of the original cathedral. That prompted much public debate but the president eventually said the spire would be reconstructed exactly as it was.The causes behind the huge blaze are still unclear. The investigators do not believe it was arson, and current leads including an electrical glitch or a cigarette butt discarded by one of the construction workers involved in a previous renovation of the cathedral.However, the size of the fire means much of the evidence police could work with went up in smoke with the building. Experts now say they may never find out what caused the inferno.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"summer holidays popular destinations reach two thirds families","story":"Summer holidays to popular destinations will be out of reach for at least two-thirds of families because testing could increase the cost of travel by 160 per cent, a study for international airlines has found.The research, for the International Air Transport Association (IATA), showed that even with cheaper tests more than half of travellers would be priced out of holidays in destinations such as the Spanish Canary islands.The modelling, by Oxera and Edge Health, economics and health experts used by the NHS, calculated the costs of testing on five typical routes including UK to New York, Frankfurt and Singapore for business, UK-Pakistan for family and UK-Canaries for holidays.With the current gold standard PCR testing regime that would apply to amber risk countries like Spain, a family of four would have to take 16 tests at a potential cost of £1,600 – more than doubling the travel bill to £2,600 and adding 32 per cent to the £3,950 price of a holiday.On the London-Frankfurt route, testing would increase the cost of travel by between 57 per cent and 143 per cent depending on whether PCR or antigen tests were used.The cost of testing is a lower proportion of the fare on long-haul business routes, such as London-New York and UK-Singapore, given the higher business class fares on these routes – but it would still add 11 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.The modelling shows that based on five routes studied, the cost impact of PCR testing will reduce demand by an average of 65 per cent, said the report. Replacing PCR with antigen testing would still have a cost impact on demand, but at 30 per cent.The Government is due to unveil its traffic light lists of countries around May 10 in advance of the ban on foreign travel being lifted from May 17. Only a handful of countries are expected to be on the safe quarantine-free green list, where only two tests are needed including one PCR.It is, however, unlikely to include the most popular European destinations, which are expected to be on the amber list, where any travellers will have to quarantine at home for 10 days on their return and take two PCR tests as well as a pre-departure test.Willie Walsh, the former boss of BA and now the director general of IATA, said: Studies show that antigen tests can be as effective as PCR tests.By mandating PCR testing unnecessarily the Government forces consumers to pay high prices for testing, often to companies who are exploiting the health crisis with the excessive fees they charge. On top of this, the Government rubs salt in the wounds of consumers by charging VAT on these rip-off fees.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch google nasa release amazing timelapse planet earth has","story":"Using 20 million satellite photos from the past 37 years, Google Earth can now show viewers the world from the fourth dimension – time.The work is focused on climate change, and the human impact on the world. Scientists at Nasa and Google guide the viewer through changes including forest change, urban growth, warming temperatures, sources of energy, and our world’s fragile beauty, in a set of timelapse videos.The Timelapse project was made by Nasa, the United States Geological Survey’s Landsat program, the world’s first civilian Earth observation program, and the European Union’s Copernicus satellites.A Google spokesman said: Our planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century – more than any other point in human history. Many of us have experienced these changes in our own communities I myself was among the thousands of Californians evacuated from their homes during the state’s wildfires last year. For other people, the effects of climate change feel abstract and far away, like melting ice caps and receding glaciers. With Timelapse in Google Earth, we have a clearer picture of our changing planet right at our fingertips — one that shows not just problems but also solutions, as well as mesmerizingly beautiful natural phenomena that unfold over decades.Pan over the Amazon rainforest, and the human impact is seen in sharp relief. We all know the forest is disappearing at a rate of knots, but this shows the devastating loss of trees as the green fades to brown on our screens in such a short space of time.Perhaps the starkest example of urban growth over the last 37 years is Dubai. Google Timelapse shows the desert take shape into an urban metropolis, and you can watch as the artificial beaches are created.It is also strangely mesmerising to watch the housing sites and roads being built on the desert in Doha, Qatar, and view just how much humans have spread across the desert.You can also look at the snaking Thames and how London has grown in density over the decades. Although it is less dramatic than watching a city be built from scratch, it is still interesting to see how London has changed.Many parts of the world show the impact of a warming climate on Google Timelapse, but perhaps the best example is the Farmer Glacier in Antarctica. The video shows just how much the ice cap has melted, in real-time.Another victim of warming temperatures are our lakes, rivers and oceans.

Having repeatedly pushed for a shrunken US presence during the Obama administration, Mr Biden is now finally in a position to force the decision through. It is exaggerated to say this is the end of American power, but it does highlight the limitations of a form of conflict that dominated the 2000s.While the initial impetus for going into Afghanistan was to destroy Al-Qaeda and punish those who supported it, as time went on it became clear that what the Western alliance was getting into was in fact merely the latest phase in a conflict that has been troubling Afghanistan for decades.Trying to resolve the larger conflict was something that would likely take generations of state building and transformation - none of which was necessarily wanted or accepted by everybody in Afghanistan.The invasion became a Sisyphean endeavour being carried out while people died, vast sums of money were spent and political capital slowly ebbed away.The other key lesson is being learned by insurgent and terrorist organizations, who can see once again that by simply holding on, victory against even the mightiest military machine is possible.While the direct threat to the west from terrorist groups in Afghanistan is vastly reduced (though not entirely gone away, there is a case currently on trial in Germany of a cell who were talking to the Islamic State in Afghanistan), Al-Qaeda will undoubtedly celebrate the victory loudly and the Taliban will no doubt present themselves as victors. Terrorists may gather again in the ungoverned spaces that emerge from the withdrawal. Nevertheless, it is far from clear that we will see another attack on the scale of September 11, 2001. Intelligence agencies are far savvier about the potential of such threats and while withdrawal means coverage of Afghanistan will go down, it will not entirely go away. Within Afghanistan, people are concerned about the Taliban\u0027s return of power and influence.An organization with a medievalist outlook that has not significantly changed in the past twenty years, it still clearly has substantial appeal among Afghans.Many in the country are doubtless concerned about a return to the civil war and warlordism that scourged the country during the 1990s. Both of these are sadly possible outcomes.But this is not the same country as it was before. And it is not clear that all the gains of the past two decades will immediately be lost.Regional powers still have a vested interest in ensuring that some stability exists, and that violence in the country does not get too out of hand.The key question in all of this, however, is what the Afghan people want and how their leaders will help them achieve it. The ultimate answer to Afghanistan’s long troubles will only ever come from within the country.Raffaello Pantucci is Senior Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"The Queen will sit alone during the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral service and will wear a mask throughout, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.Her Majesty, 94, will be unable to be comforted during the 50-minute ceremony as the Royal family adheres to strict Covid guidelines. Read the full story.The naval call Action Stations will be sounded as the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s body is lowered into the Royal Vault, Buckingham Palace revealed on Thursday, as details of how he planned his funeral with military precision were released.Prince Philip was the guiding force behind all elements of the arrangements, having meticulously planned the ceremony over at least 18 years. Read the full story.The Duke of Cambridge will not walk shoulder to shoulder with the Duke of Sussex at the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s funeral, with the two being separated by Peter Phillips.Seemingly in recognition of ongoing tensions between them, the Royal brothers will flank their older cousin as they walk in a procession behind their grandfather\u0027s coffin from the State Entrance of Windsor Castle to the West Steps of St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday. Read the full story​.Nearly one in 10 patients in need of hospital care faces a wait of more than a year, according to figures that reveal the toll of Covid on the NHS.At least 387,885 people had been waiting for more than 52 weeks in February, a 240-fold rise on the year before when the number was 1,613, data shows.

What’s perhaps less appreciated, though, is how much he enjoyed a gentle joke at his own expense.I discovered this for myself 15 years ago. In my role as the ’s front page cartoonist for the last 30-odd years, occasionally the subjects of my jokes will get in touch and ask for the original artwork. I’ve sent cartoons to prime ministers, celebrities and all manner of other public figures, but until April 2006, never to Buckingham Palace.That month, the Queen turned 80, and received some 20,000 birthday cards. I don’t often draw cartoons about the Royal family, but it felt appropriate to mark the occasion. And so I did, with this cartoon depicting two footmen perusing cards displayed on a mantelpiece in the Palace:I didn’t think much of it, though a reader got in touch to lightly admonish me for being disgracefully disrespectful in joking about the Queen’s age. Not long afterwards, however, I received a letter from the Palace, stating that they loved the cartoon and someone – I think the subtext was “someone very senior” – had requested I send the original. Enjoyably, I was able to tell the disgruntled reader that I was sorry they’d been offended, but if it was any comfort, the butt of the joke clearly felt otherwise…That moment was a thrill, but a while later I was invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. It was me, five or six other people, the Duke and the Queen. I was petrified, as anyone in that position might be, but the nerves only lasted while we waited for their arrival. When they entered the room, the tension seemed to dissipate. I expect that’s the effect they have on a lot of people – in anticipation, they’re terrifying in reality, their great skill is putting a room instantly at ease.I was seated next to Prince Philip, who was exactly as you might imagine: funny, charming, relaxed, mildly cantankerous. Everybody else was served wine but, as was often his wont at lunchtime, he had a beer. I was a little jealous – I quite fancied a beer, too, but changing my order probably wouldn’t have been the done thing.Funnily enough, there was a boat stuck on a sandbank outside of Portsmouth that week – not unlike the recent Suez Canal logjam. The Duke, with all his naval expertise, was explaining at length just what the crew had done wrong, putting them straight on this and that, and generally proving that, even in his mid-80s, his maritime knowledge was undimmed.I also recall a wonderful rant about all the banquets he’s had to attend around the world. In some places, the Duke told me, the staff would even move his cutlery for him, and he found that infuriating. “I’m perfectly capable of moving my own fork when I want it,” he huffed. In a way, it would have been disappointing to lunch with Prince Philip and not hear him bluster.When lunch came to an end, I was asked if I would have coffee with the Queen. (I say asked at those sorts of events, who you speak to is largely based on instruction from staff.)In another room, as I gingerly drank a cup of black coffee, the Queen told me how the geese were ruining her lawn at Sandringham. I suggested she have William and Harry shoot them, which made her laugh. At the time, I hadn’t yet moved to Norfolk, which is a shame, as then I could have said: “We must have you to ours next…”The Queen later remembered my grandfather, VS Pritchett, to whom she awarded membership to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1992, and seemed thrilled to have worked out that connection. I have been on a high ever since that day. I think I floated back to the office afterwards, but do remember bumping into a colleague in the street who asked if I’d been out to lunch. Had I ever…Throughout his life, Prince Philip was an enthusiastic supporter of cartoons. In 1949, he and the young Princess Elizabeth attended the Royal Society of Arts and listened to a speech by HM Bateman, the great Punch cartoonist, as he called for a national museum of cartoons. It must have left an impression since the Duke later opened the Cartoon Museum’s first permanent site in 2006, and was patron for over 20 years.He really did. He was a  reader, and while I made several jokes at his expense over the years – one, after he retired from public duties in 2017, was simply a plaque reading, “UNVEIL YOUR OWN DAMN PLAQUE” another, after his minor car crash the following year, showing a scrap metal dealer selling “Royal souvenirs” – he always seemed to like my cartoons.In 2018, when I celebrated my 30th anniversary on the paper, he even sent a short tribute.“Successful cartoonists do not only need to be able to draw, they have to think of subjects to illustrate,” he wrote. “Matt has shown that he has a genius for both, as well as the ability to think of wonderfully appropriate swipes at the idiocies of contemporary life.”It was already an amazing day, and I was already a big fan of the Duke, but the shock and honour of having him suggest he was even slightly a fan of mine left me a little lost for words. He was a man who knew the value of good humour, both to puncture the tension of a room and as a way of diluting the serious business of life, and he was a fine exponent of it.The country is far poorer for the Duke’s passing, but one way we might carry on his legacy is to keep on having a good laugh. He wouldn’t have wanted us to stay sombre for long.To own your own Matt print, visit telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british gas using coronavirus cover","story":"NewsopinionBritish Gas is using coronavirus as cover to sack staff and cut costsNoxious gas bosses wont let a crisis go to waste with their fire and rehire ultimatum to boiler engineersmirrorShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  APR NewsopinionBritish Gas engineers went on strike before being forced to sign new contracts.

Holly Mailey started out as an apprentice and gave the company  years of loyal service. But the mum of three has lost her job after refusing to sign a new contract that would cut her pay and end flexible hours. Holly, , spoke out after the Mirror yesterday told of the fury of up to  engineers sacked by British Gas for rejecting the new deals. She said: “I was so proud to wear the British Gas unorm and I have always loved my job. “But the last few weeks have been hell. I have been crying a lot. “The whole thing has been a total rollercoaster. “To think after nearly  years of service that’s it, it’s all over. It’s not just me. British Gas is losing ­thousands of years’ experience by getting rid of all these engineers.” Holly, from Dartford, Kent, was on maternity leave with her third child, daughter Matilda, now three months, when staff were given the choice of either signing the new deal or getting the sack.  She claimed the shake-up would have left her £ a month worse off. Holly said the firm this week relented and agreed to certain changes, but she would still have been £ out of pocket. And she told how doing away with flexible hours in the contract for most engineers made it ­impossible for her to juggle work and dropping off and picking up her two older children, aged eight and five. With the support of her husband, BT worker Vincent, she decided not to sign. She added: “They have given me no choice.” Holly claimed most of those who had agreed to the new deals did so because they had no other choice financially.  She added: “I have a friend, a single mum, who signed because couldn’t afford to lose her job as she has a mortgage.” Unions have accused British Gas of “bullying” staff into signing the new deals. Under the contract changes, full-time engineers are required to work an extra three hours a week,  hours in total. And they would not be paid a higher rate to work when required on weekends and public holidays.

The funeral of the late -year-old will take place on Saturday at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle where his family will gather for a ceremonial royal farewell. The exact timings of the procession have been released detailing how and when the small gathering of mourners will honour the late Prince. The Duke of Edinburghaposs coffin will rest in a private chapel inside Windsor Castle until shortly before the funeral begins. At .pm the coffin will move to the state entrance where it will be loaded onto a Land Rover. Five minutes later a small procession will accompany the vehicle through the castle grounds, as the military lines the route. Members of the Royal Family are set to follow the procession on foot, but not the Queen. The procession will then arrive at west steps of St George’s Chapel at .pm before the coffin is carried to the top of the steps. A minuteaposs silence will then be held at pm before the coffin is taken into the chapel. Near the end of the service a Royal Marine will play the stirring Action Stations, sounded on naval warships to mean: “All hands must go to battle stations.” The wartime alert, a tradition in naval funerals, will honour Philip’s distinguished service during the Second World War. Philip wanted the call to echo around the vast th century St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle as his family gather for his ceremonial royal farewell on Saturday.  A Palace spokesman said: “I think it just goes to show the level of detail that the Duke went into around his own funeral service. “It is a fitting testimony to remind many people who might not realise that the Duke saw active service in the Second World War aboard a ship in the Royal Navy.” The Duke, who died last Friday aged , was mentioned in despatches for his service. A royal source said: “The symbolism of his final call will not be lost on the family. “That even in the Duke’s final moments before he is laid to rest he was calling on his troops, his family, to man their posts. “The Duke often spoke to his family about the need to support the Queen and the institution and perhaps there is no more poignant time than this given the recent history and controversies raging within the family.

Somebody set fire to our new decking area, Mr Haines said. It was definitely on purpose. We called it the secret garden, it was a decking that was completely covered. A seating area with a fire pit and sofa. It was a really nice relaxing area we could use for events and weddings going forward. They built the area to so the pub could seat an extra  people outside, following four months of closure due to the latest lockdown. The garden cost around £, to build and its destruction will cost at least £, a day in lost revenue.

The brothers will walk together but be separated by cousin Peter Phillips who will stand between them. The royal funeral will bring the two brothers together for the first time in a year, following Harry and Meghan Markleaposs decision to walk away from the royal family. The Queen has signed off plans which will see Harry and William walking behind Philipaposs coffin as it makes its way to St Georgeaposs Chapel. She has decided on each and every detail of her husbandaposs funeral to ensure his wishes are carried out as much as possible under the trying circumstances of the pandemic. Her Majesty is said to have insisted that nothing detract from what the day is about, commemorating the extraordinary le of her husband.

When Philipaposs coffin is taken into St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle, William will move ahead of his brother as the royal family arrives in pairs. A rt between Harry and William grew in the run-up to Megxit. The pair performed their last royal engagement together in March , although they did not speak or make eye contact during the event. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined William and Kate at Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day Service.  Harry previously told ITV that he and William were aposon dferent pathsapos in response to reports about the brothers falling out.And Prince William was said to be left aposreelingapos after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle conducted a tell-all interview with Oprah earlier this year.The Duke of Cambridge subsequently told reporters we are not a racist family after couple claimed a senior royal asked how dark Archieaposs skin would be before he was born. But the Queen has now signed off on plans which will see the brothers reunited at Philipaposs funeral. In a bid to spare Harry embarrassment, the monarch has ordered senior royals to forgo wearing military unorms at the funeral.  A royal source told The Mirror: As with everything to do with the planning of the Dukeaposs funeral, the Queen has decided on each and every detail, right down to the order of procession and making sure even in the current circumstances Prince Philipaposs wishes are carried out as much as possible. The Queen is determined that nothing should detract from what the day should be about and that is to commemorate the remarkable le of her beloved husband. The family are united in their grief for the loss of a much loved father, grandfather and family member and are determined to give the Duke a proper send off. Harry faced being the only member of the family to be wearing a suit after he was stripped of his honorary ranks when he quit his role as a senior royal.  Both Harry and his we gave up their His and Her Royal Highness titles after splitting from the Firm and agreed to stop using the term aposroyalapos in official correspondence. In February, Harry was stripped of his honorary titles, such as Captain General of the Royal Marines, by the Queen. This means the Duke of Sussex cannot wear corresponding military unorms. The Royal Navy was also reportedly unhappy about the prospect of Prince Andrew wearing an admiralaposs unorm at the funeral, fearing the service could be dragged into a row. Andrew was forced to step back from all royal roles following his disastrous appearance on BBC Newsnight in November  exposing his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Details of Philipaposs funeral have been released by Buckingham Palace and it has been confirmed the Queen - like all  guests invited to the service - will wear a face mask. She will sit by herself in the quire of St Georgeaposs Chapel, with all mourners following Covid guidelines and remaining socially distanced. Philip was the guiding force behind his funeral arrangements and, reflecting his le-long association with the Royal Navy, buglers of the Royal Marines will sound Action Stations during the service.

Rebecca Bostock lived in agony for  months thinking she was suffering from the gynaecological or stomach condition. But when she found herself in so much pain she made yet another visit to AE on Good Friday this year medics realised she was gravely-ill and carried out an emergency le-saving operation. The -year-old from Winchcombe, near Cheltenham, is now at the start of a long, road to recovery and wants to warn others with the same symptoms to make sure they know about Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome . The condition is also Known as Wilkieaposs disease.  Describing the last  months a aposhellapos, Rebecca told Gloucestershire Live : I have been going round and round in circles being told it was probably down to IBS or endometriosis.If my partner had not taken me into hospital when he did, I would not be here today.

I was hours away from losing my le and I want to make sure the same thing doesnapost happen to anybody . Rebeccaaposs ordeal began in January last year when she started suffering suffering stomach swelling, fever, sickness, diarrhoea and dizziness.Over the next  months she had a string of scans and numerous hospital visits and was told it was probably Irritable Bowel Syndrome or endometriosis. Rebecca lost three stone in weight, could not work or go riding any more and the side affects of her prescribed medications made her feel worse.

Doctors were investigatingshe had pelvic congestion syndrome when Chris drove her to hospital on the advice of . It was at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where medics diagnosed SMAS and gave her emergency duodenojejunostomy surgery. SMAS is a condition of the digestive system which affects fewer than one per cent of the population and occurs when part of the small intestine is compressed between two arteries, causing a partial or complete blockage. My stomach was swollen so much that I couldnapost breathe and was essentially crippled, she said. At the hospital they took me into imaging and I am so grateful to the surgeon who spotted that I had this rare but le threatening digestive condition and needed the operation straight away.  They told Chris I wouldnapost be alive in a few hours timeI didnapost have it. Itaposs really frightening to think how close I came but now I am just relieved itaposs over. Her surgeon said he would be re-plumbing the stomach to remove the blockage and open up the pathway and over a week after the corrective surgery she cannot eat solid foods. Rebecca faces a long road to recovery but she is relieved the nightmare is finally coming to an end. She is determined to teach the world about the rare condition so that others can learn to spot the signs earlier.

The extremely graphic video shows an unnamed police officer chasing after Adam Toledo in an alleyway in Chicagoaposs West Side at .am on March . The body-camera video from the officer then shows him yelling stop to Toledo before he caught up to him and ordered him to show him his hands. Toledo appears to raise his hands right before the officer fired one shot. Shots fired, shots fired. Get an ambulance over here now, the policeman is heard saying in the video as he runs towards the boy. Stay with me, stay with me the officer said. Somebody bring the medical kit now. Immediately following the incident the Chicago Police Department said that Toledo had a gun in his hand. It is unclear in the video whether he did at the time of the shooting. About  minutes and  seconds into the video, the officer shined a flashlight on a handgun feet from where officers worked frantically to save Toledoaposs le, giving him CPR. Officers were chasing Toledo and a man after they received notication of shots fired in the area, the department said. There were a number of forces that met up at two-thirty in the morning on March  in an alley, and, simply put, we failed Adam, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said during a news conference before the video was release.  She added: As a mom, this is not something you want children to see. The cityaposs Civilian Office of Police Accountability also released some  data files, including other police body camera videos, footage from nearby security cameras and documents related to the incident. The incident, along with Sundayaposs fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright in a Minneapolis suburb and the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the May  death of George Floyd, has raised tensions in Chicago. Chicago, as well as way too many parts of our country, has a long legacy of police violence and police misconduct that have left far too many residents, especially those who are Black and brown, in a constant state of fear and pain, Lightfoot said. City officials urged people to remain calm as they prepared for civil unrest following the release of the video footage.  They said more police officers and city equipment would be in place to protect businesses during any unrest. Like some other American cities, Chicago experienced riots and looting after Floydaposs death, which was also caught on video. Toledoaposs family said in a statement released to local media that they appreciated the support they had received from the community and were grateful that protests in Chicago over the last few days remained peaceful. We pray that for the sake of our city, people remain peaceful to honour Adamaposs memory and work constructively to promote reform, the family said.

Dustin Hall shed a phenomenal  stone and his we Raquel, , lost eight stone after doctors told them that losing weight was their only chance at parenthood. The -year-old underwent a gastric bypass in July  and adopted a high-protein, low-carb diet to take him from a massive  stone to a svelte -and-a-half stone in just two-and-a-half years. Raquel, inspired by his success, had the same operation in December  - and in April  she discovered she was pregnant. The couple, from Lathrop, Northern Calornia, USA, became parents to Presley on December ,  and insisted that their weight loss journey made parenthood possible. Dustin, who works in insurance, said: The only reason we can have kids is because we lost a signicant amount of weight and we kept it off. I couldnapost be an active father at  stone. I couldnapost even tie my own shoes at that weight. Raquel, who works at a non-profit, said: We had been trying for seven years and you do get discouraged. I had never seen the two lines on a pregnancy test before. I felt like we did it, we got healthy and we accomplished this. Being a mum is worth every second of weight loss, every calorie burned, every sweaty moment in the gym. Dustinaposs doctor had warned him thathe did not shrink his bulky frame he could die within six months.  He said thatI didnapost turn things around, I might not be here in six months, the dad added. I was having a hard time breathing in the middle of the night. I couldnapost tie my shoes. I couldnapost walk more than  yards without having to sit down. The conversation with my doctor scared me into shape. Dustin underwent the procedure where a surgeon creates a small pouch in the stomach to restrict how much food it can hold. He also drastically overhauled his diet, avoiding fast food and instead building meals with chicken, fish or seafood, fruit and vegetables. Dustin added: I was really uneducated about food. I would commonly have anywhere between , to , calories a day.  I would go to Taco Bell and have , calories for lunch. I drank two or three -liter bottles of soda a day. Iaposm now focussed on nutrition and whole foods and staying away from processed food. It took him two and half years to shed all the weight and go from a XL to a large top size. I did HIIT workouts. I also looked at why I used food as a coping mechanism, he continued. Mindful meditation was really important for me - just taking a few moments to practice breathing. Raquel was motivated to lose weight herself when she realized that her husband weighed less than she did. She added: He already had a six pack by the time I started. It really hit me when all of a sudden he weighed less than I did - I didnapost want that.  Raquel also suffered from polycystic oy syndrome , a condition that makes it harder for women to get pregnant. I never ovulated even with medications and so my doctor said that my chance to become pregnant was to lose weight, she said. I followed what Dusty did. I had a gastric bypass and I went low-carb. We stuck to our program and I worked myself up to going to the gym six times a week. Soon the coupleaposs dates involved exercising together instead of going out to eat. Dusty and I would go to the gym together on Saturdays, Raquel said. Weaposd go hiking together - our dates began to look dferent.  Raquelaposs exercise and diet regime took her from lbs to lbs. Despite their weight loss success, the couple was still astonished when Raquel became pregnant. Dustin said: We randomly took a test and it showed a very faint second line. We decided to get a second test and it popped up saying pregnant.

Rob said: Shampoo is a harsh cleanser - it cleans your hair but also strips the hair of natural oils and texture. When washing your hair, the chemicals used in shampoo combine with oil on your scalp and hair, removing all oil when rinsed. This process also removes the healthy oils produced by your scalp to protect the hair which is why your hair will often feel dry without a conditioner. He added: By stripping the hair of natural oils, you encourage the sebaceous glands to overreact and produce even more oil, resulting in greasy hair. So, Rob urges people to avoid shampoo that contains many strong detergents, preservatives, sulphates, and synthetic fragrances. Instead, he suggests using an oil-based shampoo with essential oils and organic ingredients, which will clean the scalp while leaving hair colour intact. That way, your hair will recover and thrive after a new colour session and will stay vibrant for longer, he adds. Not only does a shampoo-free lestyle ensure healthy hair, but for those who have booked in for hair appointments since April th, avoiding shampoo can massively extend the le of your new look. How to increase the lespan of your hair colour Don’t wash your hair for  hours after a colour Each hair strand contains tiny pores that open and close, called hair cuticles. These open during the dyeing process to absorb the new colour and take time to close. If you wash your hairwithin  hours of having it coloured, the dye can wash out of the cuticles before they’ve had a chance to close. This quickly fades your hair colour. Turn the temperature down when washing your hair These cuticles also get opened and damaged by extreme heat. Turning your shower down to a lukewarm temperature when washing helps to avoid dye running from your hair.

As fears grow of a war in Ukraine, the US issued financial transaction bans, expelled  more Russian officials and slammed the Kremlin for putting bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan. America even hit out at the Russian regime for its treatment of dissident politician Alexei Navalny, who has been poisoned with Novichok and is now in jail. Moscow immediately hit back warning it would react to the sanctions and refused to back down on its aggressive posture towards Ukraine and the wider region. The UK and US blasted Russia’s SVR spy agency for its “malign behaviour,” to try to get Vladimir Putin to back off.  It came as more Russian troops amassed at Ukraine’s border, Moscow’s warships conducted live firing in the Baltic Sea and Putin’s land forces practised full-on attacks. America stopped two of its warships USS Donald Cook and USS Roosevelt from approaching the Black Sea, to avoid direct tension with Putin’s navy. But instead the UK and US jointly called out Russia, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing new measures to attack Moscow’s inner-circle. More crippling sanctions were slapped on Russia, banning US financial service companies from transacting in the primary market with ruble or non-ruble bonds.  The gamble is aimed at further smashing Russia’s economy and discrediting Putin, whose domestic ratings are already suffering.US President Joe Biden signed off a new Executive Order green-lighting new measures to sanction Russian companies with links to spy agencies.America also noted claims Russian spies had offered terrorists in Afghanistan up to £, a-time bounties for killing US troops or other members of allied forces. Blinken said in a statement from the US embassy in London: “Today, we announced actions to hold the Russian Government to account for the SolarWinds intrusion, reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, and attempts to interfere in the  U.S. elections. “These actions are intended to hold Russia to account for its reckless actions.  “We will act firmly in response to Russian actions that cause harm to us or our allies and partners. “Where possible, the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the goal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with US interests.” America also directly accused Moscow of being behind the wide-ranging  SolarWinds cyber hack in which Putin’s spooks hacked into at least nine government agency systems.

But some ethicists in the UK have raised concerns, saying the work poses signicant ethical and legal challenges and opens Pandoraaposs box to human-nonhuman chimeras. They are calling for a public discussion about the ethical and regulatory challenges associated with human-animal chimeras, organisms whose cells come from two or more iniduals. Researchers from the Salk Institute in Calornia produced what is known as monkey-human chimeras, with human stem cells - special cells that have the ability to develop into many dferent cell types - inserted in macaque embryos in petri dishes in the lab.  The scientists, led by Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, say their work could pave the way for addressing the shortage in transplantable organs as well as help understand more about early human development, disease progression and ageing. Prof Izpisua Belmonte said: These chimeric approaches could be really very useful for advancing biomedical research not just at the very earliest stage of le, but also the latest stage of le. In , Prof Izpisua Belmonte and his team created the first human-pig hybrid, where they incorporated human cells into early-stage pig tissue but found that human cells in this environment had poor molecular communication. So the team decided to investigate lab-grown chimeras using a more closely related species - macaques. The human-monkey chimeric embryos were monitored in the lab for  days before being destroyed. According to the scientists, the results, published in the journal Cell, showed that human stem cells survived and integrated with better relative efficiency than in the previous experiments in pig tissue.  The team said understanding more about how cells of dferent species communicate with each other could provide an unprecedented glimpse into the earliest stages of human development as well as offer scientists a powerful tool for research on regenerative medicine. Prof Izpisua Belmonte maintains that their work has met the current ethical and legal guidelines, adding: As important for health and research as we think these results are, the way we conducted this work, with utmost attention to ethical considerations and by coordinating closely with regulatory agencies, is equally important. Ultimately, we conduct these studies to understand and improve human health. Commenting on the research, Dr Anna Smajdor, lecturer and researcher in biomedical ethics at the University of East Angliaaposs Norwich Medical School, said: This breakthrough reinforces an increasingly inescapable fact: biological categories are not fixed - they are fluid. This poses signicant ethical and legal challenges.

On Thursday the United States announced sanctions against Russia and the expulsion of  diplomats in retaliation for what Washington says is the Kremlinaposs U.S. election interference, a huge cyber attack and other hostile activity.The action came amid a build-up of Russian troops and armour close to Ukraine’s eastern border and in occupied Crimea.Margarita Simonyan, RTaposs editor in chief who typically takes an aggressive stance when it comes to Ukraine, questioned whether the Russian invasion of Donbass would be considered proportionate. “Would taking Donbass home be seen as an asymmetric answer…  she asked of the Ukrainian region which borders Russia. And would bringing Donbass home be considered the inevitable answer ” Her strong words were matched by Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman. She said: “We have warned the US on numerous occasions of the consequences of their hostile steps, which dangerously raise the degree of confrontation between our countries. “The US is not ready to accept the objective reality of a multi-polar world which rules out American hegemony. It prefers sanctions, pressure and meddling in our internal affairs, she added. “Such aggressive behaviour will undoubtedly be met with a decisive response. “A response to the sanctions is unavoidable. Washington must realise that it will have to pay a price for the degradation of bilateral relations. Responsibility for what is going on fully rests with the US. The US measures were announced just two days after President Joe Biden had a first conversation as president with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and suggested that they hold a summitLeonid Slutsky, chairman of the Russian parliament’s international affairs committee, said: It is dficult to talk about the prospects for a meeting between Putin and Biden against the background of new US sanctions.”  The move acts to “devalue the constructive tone of this conversation” between the two presidents in their recent phone call, he said. Yesterday the Mirror reported that Russian forces massing on Ukraine’s border had daubed assault vehicles with ominous “invasion stripes,” heightening fears of all-out war breaking out.

As soon as there is a nice weekend forecast I just dread how many people are suddenly going to camp and leave a mess behind,” she said.Jenner is one of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people living in some of Tayside and Fe’s most beautul spots who have seen ‘dirty camping’ blight their lives.Coined last year, #dirty camping# is a term for overnight campers who leave a trail of destruction when their party ends.And local residents are left to pick up their mess.Jenner, who lives on the banks of Loch Tummel in Highland Perthshire, spent “every week” last year cleaning up abandoned campsites.“We were clearing away tents, sleeping bags, blankets, disposable barbeques, countless beer bottles, drugs paraphernalia. You name it.”She and a group of volunteers moved in when the ‘dirty campers’ had moved out.“The reason we live here is we enjoy the countryside and the beauty of the area. So to see that being destroyed, and to see all the rubbish being left around, is disheartening.”Jenner is far from alone.In Balmerino, a picturesque Fe hamlet on the banks of the Tay, the problem has already reached crisis point.This Easter weekend a group of  or  people descended on the village. They brought an electricity generator to power their night under the stars.“All of the young people kept coming and they set up three quite big campsites along the beach,” said one long-term Balmerino resident, who did not wish to give her name for fear of potential reprisals.Neighbours called the police to tackle the noise.“The police van arrived. They went and spoke to them. And the police left and they just turned the music back on again.“People started arriving after midnight in taxis. They were wandering around people’s garden asking where the party was.”Some of the group #dirty camping# went on to break fencing, make a hole in the parlour door of the Abbot’s house in the abbey and dislodge several stones from the abbey ruins.“They must have been looking for somewhere to stay. They had gone into the abbey. When they couldn’t get into the parlour they actually kicked a hole in the door,# the woman added.“It was Easter weekend. Holy of holies. And it’s the first time I’ve seen vandalism and desecration in the abbey.”It’s the first time I’ve seen vandalism and desecration in the abbey.”The local farmer drove down to the site after with a bucket fixed to his tractor. The villagers then filled it to the brim with abandoned tents, chairs, bottles and the rest.National Trust for Scotland manager Stuart Maxwell confirmed the damage to their property and appealed for anyone with information to go to the police.“We appreciate that everyone is bored and fed up with lockdown, but there is absolutely no excuse for the utterly stupid, selfish and thoughtless acts of vandalism perpetrated on an important historic site,” he added.Dad Steve Burke discovered a mess of tents, broken bottles and other waste while walking with his daughters near Barry Mill outside Carnoustie.The campers had trashed the Angus beauty spot over two nights, vandalising the grounds of the historic -year-old mill, setting fire to camping equipment and using parts of the site as a makesht toilet.“We had just gone out for a walk with the girls. Me and one of my friends volunteered to go and clean up the mess and we met a third person there.“He said he had tidied up the mess on previous occasions, but he wasn’t prepared to tidy up again because he had had enough of it.”Steve said the clean-up job after the #dirty camping# left him disgusted. He helped pack the waste into “half a dozen” black bin bags.“It was the total lack of respect for nature and wildle and the fact it is a beautul site,” he said.“They had made no attempt to clean up the mess and it’s happening all across Scotland at the moment.”Aberfeldy-born businessman Stuart Brain, with family and friends, cleaned up  ‘dirty campsites’ last year.The incidents happened around Fearnan at the east end of Loch Tay.It is a measure of the problem that he does not consider himself badly affected, compared to what some of his neighbours have had to deal with.The regular loch user said: “Some of them are as brazen to have their business numbers emblazoned all the way down the sides of their vehicles.“People seem to want to persist in burning cans. They left bits of tent, camping beds and chairs. I have more tent pegs than I could use in two letimes.”Stuart is one of many bracing himself for the season to come.“It can be a bit soul destroying.“They are not wild campers # they are dirty campers.”“There are people who will moan about it. Then you will get the people who will get on and do it [clean up the mess]. I was in the latter category.“It just a case of:I don’t do this, then who the hell does ”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/Calum-Woodger-Micky-Mellon-book-e1618335615289-620x372.jpg ","title":"micky mellon dundee united new book five things first 100 days","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee United boss Micky Mellon#s new book # The First  Days # is out now and jam-packed with football wisdom.Co-authored with head teacher Phil Denton, whom Mellon met while manager of Tranmere Rovers, The First  Days: Lessons In Leadership From The Football Bosses is full of big names and even bigger ideas.With contributions from the likes of Sam Allardyce, David Moyes and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Mellon#s book is designed to be a manual to help guide gaffers through their first few months at a new club.The -page paperback is also an entertaining read for fans, Arabs or otherwise, as Mellon es deep into the minds of top managers to discover what makes them tick.Calum Woodger got his hands on a copy and this is what he found out#Following completion of the book, Mellon and Denton got together to discuss his first  days at the Tannadice helm.It#s a small but revealing section of the read, hidden in the postscript towards the end of the book, where Mellon explains how he has become #a better manager# through the writing process.The United gaffer also lts the lid on his deep affinity for the club born out of the values of his Glasgow upbringing.He reveals one of his mum#s favourite sayings: #What#s for you won#t go by you#.It seems true in the case of the marriage of Mellon and the Tangerines.He said: #I had a good chat with the owners and saw how they operated.#I liked what they had to say and I saw that they were ambitious but realistic, which is what you need.#I then got to know this town and this club.

The subsequent - defeat in the reunion with the Red Devils was a chastening lesson.However, Mellon is adamant he is comfortable with the tag of favourites that will weigh heavily around the necks of his United stars at Station Park on Friday night.“I do understand that us going up to Forfar, we’ll be expected to put on a good show,” said Mellon.“The Scottish Cup is massive for the club and we’re all very aware of how well Dundee United have done in the past.“We’re on a rebuild, getting back – hopefully # to bringing those times back again. That’s what we’re all working very hard to do here.“We want a fanatical fanbase and are delighted to have it. We just ask sometimes for a wee bit of fairness.“We’ve still got a lot of work to do to even get close but we’ve got the appetite to try and add our own bit of history to this club. We have to take that step-by-step and ty to deliver.”While evidently ambitious – the pairing of Rangers and Celtic together has left every club eyeing the latter stages hungrily – Mellon seeks to temper expectation, partly out of respect to Forfar, but also in a bid to acknowledge the realities of where United are on their journey.“It’s a heavy expectation,” notes Mellon. “We’ve just come out the Championship and sometimes, yeah, it can be easily forgotten.“On Saturday, eight or nine of the players were in the Championship last year, the three subs that all came on all played in the Championship.“When you compare it to the great years at a massive club like Dundee United, sometimes you have to ask for a bit of fairness and time to build towards being that again.“We want a fanatical fanbase and are delighted to have it. We just ask sometimes for a wee bit of fairness. But expectation levels are high and that can only make you want to keep getting better.“That’s something me and the players will continually have to try and do, to try and satisfy the expectations.”As United plot their own journey towards top-flight progress and eventual silverware, the prospect of facing former Dundee hero Gary Irvine, a rookie in the dugout, prompted Mellon to consider his own path.Mellon, now  years of age, was  when he was appointed Fleetwood manager and still recalls the dilemmas, challenges and growing pains that Irvine must tackle should his interim position become a permanent one.#It can be daunting,” continued Mellon. “Suddenly you are the guy making all the decisions and it is a very new experience from the one you had as a player or a coach. There’s a level of responsibility to your players, the fans and the owners.“As the years go by you learn to know what is important and what’s not so important as you go through your journey, and then you decide how you go through the process of getting your team to score goals, keep clean sheets and win games.“One of the things that I’ve learned as I go along is little signs things I see which show that my principles are sinking in and we’re becoming a team. One of those is that I need to shout less. #You get better at that as you go along. I am sure Gary is very excited to get the opportunity to manage a team and that’s another obstacle for us to try and overcome. I am sure he will be fighting for his le to try and get that opportunity.#However, Mellon, who again reaffirmed his commitment to United amid links to Doncaster Rovers, is quietly confident that his side can extend its fine run of form – five games unbeaten and counting – and allow him to again rest his vocal cords.He smiled: “One of the things that I’ve learned as I go along is little signs things I see which show that my principles are sinking in and we’re becoming a team. One of those is that I need to shout less.“So, I’m finding that I’m having to shout less and can pretty much tell what the players are trying to achieve when they get the ball.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

Of course, change often comes at a time when a club is down at heel, and it can take time for the incoming gaffer to improve things, so there have understandably been some miserable openers, with the list we#ve put together below containing two matches where Aberdeen have conceded five.However, no less than five new gaffers on the list have managed to get a result against Rangers in their first competitive game # a sure-fire way to endear themselves to the Dons support.Here are the some notable first games in charge for Aberdeen managers over the decades:Glass is of course succeeding long-serving boss Derek McInnes, who took charge of the Dons for the first time in April .The bottom-six Reds played out what you could generously term a low-key  minutes at Easter Road, in which there best chance fell to Jonny Hayes.Hayes, who didn#t take his opportunity to score that day, would become one of the most important players of the close-to-eight-year McInnes period at Pittodrie, in which the team racked up high league finishes, European qualications and cup finals.McInnes# predecessor Craig Brown also met Hibs in his first match in charge, having watched Aberdeen go down - the week before to another Edinburgh side in Hearts under the interim team of the two Neils, Simpson and Cooper.The veteran boss seemed to get the Dons firing, however, and they started quickest at Easter Road, creating a few chances before Yoann Folly fired them ahead.However, their frailties remained and, on the stroke of half-time, Jamie Langfield#s save from John Rankin gave Derek Riordan an easy finish.Aberdeen could easily have crumbled at this after a miserable start to the season and being pegged back, but # despite some ropey moments # they were the better side in the second period, with Scott Vernon chesting home a Paul Hartley centre for the win.Gothenburg Great Mark McGhee inherited a team which was in the Europa League qualiers after finishing fourth in Jimmy Calderwood#s final season. However, after  horrible minutes, it was apparent they wouldn#t be in them for long.Czech side Sigma ran rampant against the Dons makesht defence, containing two midfielders in Stuart Duff and Derek Young, with the home side falling apart in the second period, having gone in at half-time with the scores level at -.Aberdeen left the Pittodrie pitch to a chorus of boos and would go on to lose theleg -.Start as you mean to go on.Aberdeen may have finished th in  ,  but new boss Jimmy Calderwood hauled them up to fourth in the table in his first season in charge #  a campaign which began with an end-to-end entertaining - home draw against Rangers.Dons defender Zander Diamond earned plaudits for his performance, denying the visitors, bossed by Reds great Alex McLeish, on multiple occasions.Calderwood would go on bring a period of top-six consistency to Aberdeen, which peaked with their remarkable UEFA Cup run in   where they played Panathinaikos, Atletico Madrid, Copenhagen, Lokomotiv Moscow and Bayern Munich.Pele Paterson#s era began with a loss away to Dunfermline Athletic at East End Park.It was a game in which Aberdeen, specically Laurent D#Jaffo, had several chances to score, but in which their profligacy was also punished.Both of the Pars strikeforce of Stevie Crawford and Craig Brewster, two future Dons, got on the scoresheet, the latter with a penalty, either side of a Jamie McAllister own goal.The late Ebbe Skovdahl received a baptism of fire after taking the reins at Pittodrie on the opening day of the   season, replacing Alex Miller.Celtic#s top-class strikers, Henrik Larsson and Mark Viduka , had the game done and dusted by half-time.After the break, Eoin Jess saw an opportunity from the penalty spot go begging and with it any chance of a comeback. Larsson then scored his second from the spot for the Hoops, before Mark Burchill fired in the visitors# fth.Aberdeen#s mid-s dynamic forward duo of Billy Dodds and Duncan Shearer both netted to give Roy Aitken a great start to his reign as boss after he replaced Willie Miller.Over the rest of the campaign, the Dons were able to escape relegation, avoiding bottom spot and defeating Dunfermline - on aggregate over a two-legged play-off.They#d win the Coca-Cola Cup under Aitken the following season.Another Dodds, this time Davie, secured a point for Alex Smith and Jocky Scott on their Aberdeen debut, on what was the first day of the   season.Gordon Chisholm had netted for the home side after  minutes, but the Dons frontman restored parity six minutes later.Under Smith and Scott, Aberdeen wouldn#t lose a game # in a campaign where they finished runners-up to Rangers # until an Ibrox loss on November .Smith and Scott would lead the Dons to the cup double in  .The man who is remembered for having the poisoned chalice of following the all-conquering Fergie actually got off to a great start and didn#t lose a game for almost three months.He began with a home win over -man Rangers in front of a capacity crowd.Aberdeen#s winner came after  minutes, with Davie Dodds again the scorer. The tall attacker nodded home after strike partner John Hewitt#s shot rebounded to him.Although Ally McCoist could#ve scored for Rangers, it was mostly one-way traffic in the second period, following Dave McPherson#s dismissal for an elbow on goalscorer Dodds before the break.Legendary gaffer Ferguson#s Aberdeen would win every domestic honour, and two European trophies, during his time in charge.Although there would be no silverware in his first campaign, there was a strong debut showing against Hearts at Tynecastle.Duncan Davidson and Joe Harper scored for the Reds, alongside a Steve Archibald double, while Eamonn Bannon netted for the home side.Celtic legend McNeill#s solitary season in charge at Pittodrie, before he took over at Parkhead, saw him start with a bang, with Rangers put to the sword in the Granite City.Drew Jarvie scored from Ian Fleming#s cutback after barely  minutes and, although the visitors had a good period which saw them level through Bobby Russell, in the second half both Jarvie and then Joe Harper crashed home to secure the three points.Future Scotland boss Macleod#s debut was played in terrible weather conditions, however, a penalty from Billy Williamson and another goal from Jocky Scott were enough to overcome a United side who netted via Paul Hegarty at Tannadice.Legendary Hibs attacker Turnbull took the Dons job in  and held it for six years.His first match in charge of Aberdeen came at Pittodrie against Rangers.The Reds ran out - winners thanks to first half goals from Ernie Winchester and Don Kerrigan.In what was an unusual Division One season, Rangers would go on to finish fth, Celtic eighth and Aberdeen th.However, Turnbull would turn the Dons into a Scottish football force, winning the Scottish Cup # for just the second time in the club#s history # in  and coming oh so close to the title the following year.@AberdeenFC🎙️ Listen to this week#s Northern Goal podcast here:Apple: https:t.co LfaEKWOdySpoty: https:t.co QwsgAtj pic ZeukIXbmdash EveningExpress SportApril , For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"junior rugby club pays tribute to dedicated coach","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others. So let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.Following publication of his poem #On Distant Shore# in last week#s Courier, Jim McRobert, originally from Campbeltown but now living in Musselburgh, has sent in another one of his self-penned verses.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now. But really, any day is a good day to do that."},{"url":null,"title":"vice presidents team takes the honours in tarbert opener","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It has been such a tough time for them and their parents and carers, so I felt it was important for them to have something fun to do.#I remember how much we loved going to Carradale as a family for its egg hunt, so I thought why not bring it to town.#I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part and helped in any way to make this such a successful event. We made up  bags and just  were left!#Mandy added that the chocolate treats were purchased with a donation from The Jolly Monday Show from sales of Jerusalema dance stickers some art packs were donated by Peaches and Dreams Crafts, and the other items were purchased by The Hub through funding from Children in Need for activities for young people the sheets with the clues were printed by Keeping It Local and the orienteering clips used as stamps were on loan from Stuart McQuaker and the Physical Education department at Campbeltown Grammar School."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 9 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As a result, a number of people have been reported to the procurator fiscal.This week, once again, the team has been in action. A property in Campbeltown town centre was searched under warrant and a -year-old man and a -year-old woman reported to the procurator fiscal.Inspector Tom Harper told The Courier: ‘Recent changes in our sht pattern for officers’ work hours to make them more efficient have enabled us to use our resources to create a small pro-active team which is concentrating on drug abuse in the town.‘And we have had good and sufficient intelligence for four drugs search warrants to be executed in recent weeks.’As a result of that, two people have been reported for being concerned in the supply of drugs and the other two were for drug possession.This will continue for the foreseeable future as drug use and drug dealing has been identied as one of the greatest concerns in the community.This month, Strathclyde Police is to consult with the public on its community policing plan for the coming year. The top four concerns for Kintyre and the islands of Gigha, Jura and Islay, as well as drugs, are: anti-social behaviour, assault, violent crime and speeding motorists.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOBid to protect Sanda birdsThree Kintyre islands have been designated a conservation area in a bid to halt the decline of a species of seabird.Sanda and its surrounding islands of Sheep and Glunimore have been named as a Site of Special Scientic Interest by Scottish National Heritageas a result of the high level of shags which breed on the small group of islands.Nationally important birds such as razorbill, cormorant and puffin also breed on the islands which form the most southerly breeding area in the British Isles for the storm petrel and Manx shearwater.The islands are owned by Dick Gannon and his we Meg, both of whom live in Campbeltown. The couple are glad the wildle to be found on and around the islands had been formally recognised.Meg Gannon said: ‘The wildle on the islands has always been a great delight to us and we take its conservation seriously in all that we do on Sanda.‘The recognition by SNH that the islands are worthy of scientic designation is most welcome at this time.’Dick Gannon added: ‘We are very pleased. We have always had a green attitude on the island.’The Gannons are currently refurbishing all of the island’s properties into self-catering houses.FIFTY YEARS AGOAmericans interested in CampbeltownThe results of a small advertising spree in the USA, which cost Campbeltown Town Council £, were made known at the council’s finance committee meeting on Monday evening.Town clerk Mr William Wilson reported he had received four replies, from industrialists and one from a real estate agent.One firm, from Florida, claims to be the makers of the word’s finest rear view traffic mirrors. Another firm was involved in the plastics industry.Mr Wilson raised a laugh when he said the real estate agent wanted to #sell’ Campbeltown.On a more serious vein, Councillor Dan Black said he thought the £ was a worthwhile investment and considered it should be spent in a similar manner annually.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe mining crisisOnce again, the country has been plunged into industrial chaos by a national strike of miners.One of the most calamitous results of the great coal strike last autumn was the loss to the British coal trade of the continental market.The immediate and inevitable result must be a rise in the cost of living, because the food which was paid for by coal must now be bought in some other way, while the ships which used to sail from these shores laden with coal must now sail in ballast and make all their profits upon the homeward voyage.But it need scarcely be pointed out that the greatest sufferers have been the miners themselves, who have been condemned by the misguided policy of their leaders to severe and increasing unemployment.In these circumstances, the action which the Miners’ Executive has seen fit to take in calling a second strike is the more suicidal, since they have the lessons of the past three months vividly before their eyes.The first evidence that once again the miners are signing their own death warrant is already to hand.One of the largest firms of coal merchants in this country received, on the eve of the strike, news from New York that the American Coal Exchange was already flooded with inquiries from continental countries.Now that the strike has been declared, these inquiries must inevitably result in contracts stretching in all probability over a period of years.The result will be that however the contest is decided, and however hard the miners may subsequently be pleased to work and however cheap the price at which British coal is offered on the market, practically the entire field will already be occupied by foreign competitors and the British export market for coal will be seriously, and perhaps fatally, narrowed.The effect of that must be a corresponding rise in the cost of living and delay in that fall in the cost of production which alone can win back for this country its supremacy of the markets of the world."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious. I have rarely met someone so filled with optimism.ldquoWith his lsquogo get lsquoemrsquo attitude, he settled into Ross High School very quickly and it was a pleasure to have him here.

Some SNP Government policiesre-elected are:Our future is in our hands on May .Stevie Curran THE way in which our growing authorities are funded is extremely unfair.When compared to other councils, East Lothian and Midlothianare disadvantaged, as Scottish Government-allocated funds are failing to recognise and keep pace with our growth.Council tax income forms approximately  per cent of the entire council budget the remainder is allocated by Scottish Government.Our councils face huge challenges in meeting the growing demand for services, yet the funding model fails to take full account of our growth.It really is an insult when you consider our commitment to meet Scottish Government housebuilding demands.The Scottish Government are refusing to reciprocate that commitment and responsibility, with investment for local services and for transport infrastructureto support the growth demands they place on us.This is an unsustainable position.My support for Scottish Government housebuilding targets is not unconditional, and I say that as the cabinet member with responsibility for housing in Midlothian.In respect of Sherfhall Roundabout, the following is an extract from a  SESplan report: ldquoThe Edinburgh and the Lothians Structure Plan  and the Regional Transport Strategy identy the grade separation of Sherfhall roundabout as a key infrastructure project essential for the delivery of the development strategy. The continuing lack of Scottish Government commitment to grade separation at Sherfhall will impact inevitably on the ability of Midlothian, East Lothian, south-east Edinburgh and central Scottish Borders to contribute fully to the drive for Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.The gross underfunding of the , hours early learning and childcare implementation was highlighted at a meeting of the Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee at Holyrood.Absurdly, Scottish Ministers took the decision to allocate funding on the basis of the  population figures.This is one of the most blatant injustices and attacks on equality that Irsquove witnessed in local government.Once again, no meaningful interventions from our current MSP.I will continue to campaign for fairer funding for our councils.My constituents will always be my priority.Charles Dundas THIS week, health and wellbeing issues have been a major feature of my campaign.The last year has demonstrated just how valuable the work of healthcare professionals has been to our society, but Irsquom afraid that the problems I keep hearing about locally tend to be centred on how dficult it can be to access some services.East Lothian patients were aghast back in December when the Scottish Government abandoned the plan to develop a new Edinburgh Eye Hospital at the Royal Infirmary in Little France, and instead have them travel theof the Lothians to St Johnrsquos in Livingston.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats listened to these concerns, and during the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget last month we were able to secure a review of the decision ndash a potential leline for central access to specialist eye services in the Lothians.Irsquove also been contacted by the local campaigners concerned by the dficulties that the Riverside Medical Practice are experiencing getting staff in place to be able to serve the people of Musselburgh.I was very impressed by how organised they are no one  has asked me to make my first question in Parliament about their issue.So I have pledged thatelected, my first question in Holyrood will be to the Health Secretary, or the First Minister, about the national obstacles to local healthcare provision.For too long, vulnerable people have had to endure harrowingly long waits for mental health treatment in Scotland.There is no issue as important to the Liberal Democrats as this.On day one after the election, we will implement our new mental health recovery plan and train more mental health counsellors, bringing them into NHS workforce planning processes.As Scotland begins to reopen, we desperately need to put the recovery first and invest in health services.Mental health must be taken as seriously as physical health in the next Parliament and I promise to do just that.Iain Whyte AS I HAVE been out and about campaigning this week, I have been contacted by a number of people who have concerns over access to GP services.As the Courier has reported, this is a major issue at Riverside Medical Practice but is also affecting others across the constituency.I am extremely concerned that Musselburghrsquos housing and population have been allowed to expand so much in recent years without increasing the GP provision to cope.This had led to some patients describing the feeling that they are without a GP service because they simply cannot get an appointment.I fully understand everything the Riverside practice are doing to recruit extra staff but I donrsquot believe this is enough on its own.What is needed is that we train more doctors in Scotland for the future and that we attempt to attract more to live and work here now.After  years in charge, we can see that the SNP Scottish Governmentrsquos decisions to cap doctor training numbers at universities has had a negative impact when we have a growing and ageing population.We Scottish Conservatives have committed to an lsquoNHS escalatorrsquo, which would increase the annual budget for the NHS in Scotland by pound billion over the course of the next Parliament.This would give NHS Lothian long-term security and allow them to protect local services in the future ndash especially as NHS Lothian is underfunded compared with other areas of Scotland based on the Governmentrsquos own formula of need.I agree with the local campaigners who have started a petition to ask the Health Minister to intervene to improve GP services in Musselburgh.I am also happy to commit to make this the topic of my first Parliamentary questionelected.In the meantime, I am happy to raise talk to the practice about their plans but the long-term needs are obvious: more GPs in Musselburgh and across the constituency.This issue has been ignored for too long and itrsquos time the health board and the Scottish Government stepped up to help."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-rose-pye-celebrates-100th-birthday","story":"Keen to ensure that Rose Pye had a good time amidst Covid- restrictions,

We can eat them by the shore of the loch.They drove a short distance along the tree-lined road that follows the northern shore of Loch Earn. At times it seemed asthey were driving through thick forest, the trees arching over the road making a tunnel of branches and leaves, made vivid green by the bright sunshine that seeped through the canopy. The meaning of the lochrsquos name seems lost in time, but some say its origin is loch of the Irish.: Tims Tales, chapter oneThey had their lunch on a stony beach. Izzy performed her now-familiar ritual of boiling water for her coffee on her stove. Few words were exchanged as they ate. Izzy sat on a small boulder scanning the shore opposite. She tried to identy the place where the temporary grave of James Stewart of Ardvorlich was, a tale she hadnrsquot told Finn. Then she looked to the far western part of the loch to seethe island which had once been the stronghold of the Neish clan was visible. She wasnrsquot sureshe could see it in the heat haze. That would be a tale she would tell Finn later.Then she looked east towards the southern shore for a distant view of Edinample Castle, where tradition says the notorious Campbell chief named lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo threw an architect from the battlements. He had the castle built after displacing the MacGregors from the land. She told Finn the tale, and that the ghost of the architect is said to haunt the castle. He wanted to visit but she explained it was a private residence.ldquoSo not fair that some folks get to live in a castle! Finn complained. Izzy could only agree.Finn wanted to sunbathe for a while, so they lay like slumbering seals. Izzy closed her eyes, face up to the sun. It was now really hot. Soon shersquod had enough and sat up, took off her shoes and socks, rolled up her trouser legs and headed for the water.Finn looked up and quickly joined her. They both stood, knee deep in the cooling waters of the loch, splashing themselves. Then they picked up stones from the lochrsquos bed and threw them. ldquoHaving a competition, just like the giants, Finn remarked.: Tims Tales, chapter twoThen he noticed that his aunt had a tattoo on the lower part of her left leg.ldquoI didnrsquot know you had a tattoo, what is it  he asked.She lted her leg out the water for a moment.ldquoCool, is it a dolphin  asked Finn.ldquoItrsquos a Pictish symbol, copied from one of their carvings on a standing stone. Itrsquos called the water beast but I think itrsquos a kelpie. Maybe even an ancient image of what people now call Nessie.ldquoNessie is a kelpie! exclaimed Finn. ldquoCan you tell me that story ldquoI will when we get there, promise.Finn was impatient, but he knew his aunt would keep her word.ldquoSo why would you want a kelpie as a tattoo : Tims Tales, chapter threeldquoWell, I like the design, but also I suppose because itrsquos part of the ancient culture of our land ancestors.They walked back to the beach and sat with their legs sprawled out to dry their feet and legs in the sun.Finn was still curious as to why his aunt would want such a fearsome creature as a tattoo.ldquoI believe we are all born with a kelpie within us, she said, ldquoit can stay harmlesswe know how to keep it that way, but it can grow and become an uncontrollable monsterwe feed it the wrong things.ldquoYou mean like junk food  asked Finn quizzically.: Tims Tales, chapter fourldquoYeah, kind of, but the kelpie inside us feeds on emotions, so itrsquos junk food is emotions like hatred, jealousy, spite.ldquoSo whatrsquos its healthy food, then  wondered Finn.ldquoWhat do you think ldquoDunno, he said, then thought for a moment. ldquoLove, kindness, stuff like that.ldquoDefinitely, said Izzy. She continued: ldquoThere is even a story about a kelpie who is changed by love. He falls in love with a woman, and she with him. The Kelpie lived in Loch Garve, much further north from here. They got married and lived together at the bottom of the loch.ldquoSounds like a copy of Beauty and the Beast, said Finn.: Tims Tales, chapter fiveldquoYeah, it is a bit, except they both loved each other for who they really were. But there was one thing that made the kelpiersquos we unhappy: she was constantly cold living in the loch.ldquoObviously! said Finn.ldquoWell, the kelpie loved her and wanted to make her comfortable, so he captured a stonemason and made a deal with him. Infor his le, the stonemason had to agree to make a fireplace and chimney.ldquoWait a minute, a fire under the water ldquoYep.ldquoBut thatrsquos impossible!Izzy raised her eyebrows and gave Finn a grin.ldquoAnything is possible in a story, she said. ldquoSo the stonemason had no choice. He built the fireplace and chimney, and the kelpie made the fire. The mason was set free, and in thanks the kelpie ensured he always had a plentul supply of fish.ldquoSo just how did the kelpie make an underwater fire then Izzy shrugged her shoulders. ldquoDonrsquot know, but love can help you make the impossible possible. The we was no longer cold and they lived happily together. Every evening they sat cosily by their blazing hearth. Thatrsquos why therersquos a part of Loch Garve that never freezes, even in the coldest winters.Finn laughed at the image.Izzy rolled her trouser legs back down and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos go, she said.ldquoWhere to now ldquoKillin, itrsquos a lovely village. Some folk say its name comes from the Gaelic Cill Fhinn, which means the chapel of Finn or Fingal. Fingal was another name for Fionn MacCoul. We are going to visit Fingalrsquos Stone, which is said to be the burial place of Fionn himself!: Tims Tales, chapter sixldquoIrsquom a coming! said Finn excitedly, putting his socks and shoes on.Izzy glanced at the two old thatched houses at the foot of Glen Ogle as she drove up the steep glen. She had memories of them from her childhood, and every time she passed the old houses they seemed slightly more dilapidated. Izzy felt their deterioration and neglect symbolised so much of the story of the Highlands.As old Bess climbed up the road towards the pass, Izzy could see in her mindrsquos eye the trains running across the dramatic viaduct which formed part of the old railway line which cut through the hillside on the western slope. Now trackless, she had distant memories of seeing it in use from her early childhood before the rockfall which closed it prematurely. Those days travelling with her parents in their Morris Minor car had given her that first taste of awe at Highland landscape that had remained with her ever since. Her love for the Highlands was rooted in her fondest memories of her father, who had a passion for them.Below the modern road, on the floor of the glen, faint traces of the th-century military road meander up towards the pass at the top of the glen. Izzy had always felt that the Glen Ogle was overlooked a place where people usually passed through on the way to somewhere . Its ghosts were marching Redcoats and driven cattle on the hoof.So she always stoppedsafely possible to give the glen its place, evenfor only a brief moment of appreciation. She pulled into a layby near the top of the glen. Finn had no idea of the view that had been hiding behind him and was taken by surprise as he got out the car. He wanted to take a photo of the glen and looked for his camera. Finn was feeling it, Izzy thought to herself: that spark of awe that the landscape lights in your soul.Ten minutes later, they arrived at Killin. The first introduction to the Falls of Dochart, which can roar through the village after days of rain, can be a spectacular surprise. Izzy gave Finn no advance warning and when the rapids suddenly appeared, Finn called out: ldquoCan we stop, can we stop!: Tims Tales, chapter sevenShe pulled in and Finn was out of the car before she put the handbrake on. He stood on a rocky ledge watching and listening to the water as it raged over the rocks, its brown peaty water turning white at the fringes as it crashed its way towards the old bridge. Finn leapt between the rocks, taking himself into the middle of the rapids. Izzy held her breath, terried hersquod slip, but reluctant to restrain his joy.ldquoBe careful, Finn, she shouted out, but of course he couldnrsquot hear her. He stood, mesmerised in the midst of the torrent. Izzy sat on the wall and watched anxiously as he tried to reach a young Scots pine growing impossibly from a rock. Eventually he ed, much to Izzyrsquos relief. His boots were wet but his feet dry and his face glowing.ldquoWhat an amazing place! he said.They walked over the bridge, past Innis Bhuidhe, the ancient burial ground of the MacNabs, and the folklore centre, both of which she planned to show Finn later. Then a short walk behind the school and they were there: Fingalrsquos Stone, the resting place of the legendary Fingal, otherwise named Fionn MacCoul.Finnrsquos initial excitement turned to disappointment that the stone itself wasnrsquot more impressive. He had imagined a huge standing stone, but Finn himself was taller than it.ldquoThatrsquos it  said Finn, deflated.: Tims Tales, chapter eightldquoFinn, said Izzy, ldquobe wise to the test set by this place. He shook his head, he had no idea what his aunt was talking about.ldquoLook around any city, any land, she explained, ldquoand you will see that the tallest and grandest monuments are built to commemorate self-important men whose deeds are soaked in vanity, greed and power. The true heroes and heroines of our land have no great oversized monuments to them, they are remembered by something greater, that lasts longer than even fine-cut stone.Finn looked at his aunt for the answer.ldquoStories, Finn, stories that are told and retold, she said, ldquothey are the finest monuments to those who we truly wish to remember.Finn nodded.ldquoI was worried this trip would be boring, aunty. But itrsquos not. Not so far anyway. Thanks for teaching me all this. Can I go play on the swings over there now ldquoOf course.Izzy stood with folded arms, watching her nephew play. Very soon he would be  years old so grown up, yet still a child. Her heart ached for him, she knew the loss he carried, all the hidden pain.

The flags will remain at half mast until after the funeral.East Lothian Provost John McMillan Roderick Urquhart, the new Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian and Michael Williams, Mr Urquhartrsquos predecessor, were among those paying tribute.Mr McMillan said: ldquoThe Duke of Edinburgh throughout his le exemplied the values of public service.ldquoLike many of his generation, he experienced active service during the Second World War, serving within the Royal Navy, before marrying HM The Queen in  and embarking on a role as consort supporting her throughout her reign.ldquoI had the pleasure of meeting the Duke of Edinburgh at a reception at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and can attest to his keen observations and sharp sense of humour.ldquoHis passing in his th year concludes a remarkable era of history in which he witnessed, or had first-hand experience, of so many global and societal changes.ldquoHe leaves a major legacy in the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, which many young people across East Lothian have taken part in and gained personal achievement as a result.Mr Urquhart said: ldquoIt was with considerable sadness that I learned of the death of HRH The Duke of Edinburgh and, on behalf of the communities here in East Lothian, I offer our deepest condolences to Her Majesty and the Royal Family for their loss.ldquoListening to the many tributes, we are reminded of the invaluable role he played in supporting HM The Queen, and his extraordinary service to the nation. I have also been privileged to see at first hand on many occasions his dedication to Her Majesty on a range of public duties, as well as the personal causes he so strongly championed, including his award scheme, which benefitted so very many recipients.ldquoDuring this time of sadness, we should also reflect and celebrate his many achievements during a letime of public service.Michael Williams, who was Lord Lieutenant for East Lothian until last month, said: ldquoI met him on several occasions and I have a huge admiration for him, particularly for his work with young people.ldquoWhat a legacy to have five million-plus young people in the world having done his award.ldquoThat is what really struck me on every occasion I met him, he just exuded an aura of lsquoI want to meet you, Irsquom interested in meeting yoursquo and he had a wonderful sense of humour.ldquoHe was somebody you would never forget meeting and every one of those meetings I remember quite vividly.Mr Williams was a depute lord lieutenant when the Queen and Prince Philip visited the Lamp of Lothian Trust in July  when the organisation was marking its th anniversary.Nearly  centre users, guests, trustees and staff showed the royal party round the buildings in Haddington.He was also on hand to greet the royal party when they attended Musselburgh Racecourse in .The visit was the highlight of the racecoursersquos Bi-Centenary Raceday.Mr Williams said harness racing had been put on for the Duke of Edinburgh to enjoy on the day. He added: ldquoHe just noticed everything.Those at the racecourse remember his visit well. Sarah Montgomery, senior operations and commercial manager at Musselburgh Racecourse, said: ldquoBill Farnsworth was hosting The Queen and I hosted the Duke of Edinburgh. Most of the visit I was by his side, keeping my fingers crossed I didnrsquot put my foot in it.ldquoWe were obviously quite nervous and there was not a lot of information as to what you should and shouldnrsquot talk about but he was very nice. Both of them made it very easy in terms of putting you at ease.ldquoHe was particularly interested in the history, not just of the racecourse, but also of the golf course. I think he had anticipated coming for just a race day, but we had gathered a lot of historical information about the racecourse and the golf course and he was very interested in both.ldquoThe impression I got was that he was a keen sportsman, but perhaps racing was not his first love, it was The Queenrsquos, and he was more interested in talking to people.ldquoHe did enjoy it ndash The Queen had a runner, and I got a bit carried away when we thought her horse was going to win. I screamed quite loudly and he found it very funny that I felt quite embarrassed about getting carried away.ldquoHe was humorous he was looking to engage in conversation with people but to talk about off-beat subjects. He was trying to always personalise the situation and to put people at ease.ldquoThe Royal couple came down jointly from the Queenrsquos Stand to be involved in the presentation of The Bi-Centenary Cup, and they spoke to members of the team in the parade ring before they left. He was not bothered about being involved in the presentation, he wanted to speak to the groundstaff and office staff who were lined up, and he took the time to do that.ldquoWe all really enjoyed the fact that they seemed to enjoy their visit to Musselburgh and we were chuffed to bits to have them as guests. It was a bit of a coup for Musselburgh Racecourse and a town of Musselburghrsquos size to have a visit from the Royal Family. On behalf of our staff, our customers and everyone connected to the racecourse, we would like to send our sincere condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and the Royal Family at this sad time.Young footballers from Musselburgh Windsor Football Club were in attendance when the royal couple visited Haddington in , with Prince Philip, who was president of the Football Association from  to , keen to find out more about the club.Scott Robertson, president of Musselburgh Windsor Football Club, met Prince Philip during that visit.The Duke had been due to open the clubrsquos new changing facilities at Pinkie but they were not ready in time.Instead, representatives of the club were invited to Haddington, where they met both HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.Mr Robertson described him as ldquofairly friendly, smiley and quite down to earth. He said: ldquoI found him a fairly relaxed chap that just took his time.ldquoHe did not, funnily enough, seem to have any airs or graces.Iain Gray, who steps down as East Lothianrsquos MSP next month, told the Courier: ldquoI met Prince Philip a few times, and even sat next to him at lunch once.ldquoI always found him good company, engaging and funny.ldquoMy most memorable encounter, though, was during the visit of Pope Benedict to Scotland in . In the long receiving line at Holyrood Palace, I was placed next to Annabel Goldie, then leader of the Scottish Conservatives. The Queen and the Pope passed by, followed some way behind by the Duke of Edinburgh.ldquoHe grabbed the tartan tie I was wearing and asked: lsquoWhatrsquos this rsquo I explained it was a tartan especially commissioned for the Papal visit, and all male MSPs had been presented with one.ldquoHe turned to Annabel and said: lsquoWhat about you, then  Are you wearing knickers in this tartan rsquo and strolled off, leaving her spluttering and speechless in his wake!Lesley Brown, executive director for education and childrenrsquos services at East Lothian Council, said inidual schools would decide how to discuss the death of the Duke of Edinburgh with pupils when they ed to classes next week.She said: ldquoA number of pupils will be involved or have been involved in the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Awards scheme and I would expect discussions to be held.

running for the role.Each week, theEast Lothian Courierwill give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson THIS week, the Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East Lothian.In a few weeksrsquo time, we need to elect someone who will fight tooth and nail for investment in our health services and push to keep them as local as possible.This wonrsquot be possiblewe spend the next five years bickering over another referendum.Craig Hoy PARTY politics were rightly set aside last weekend when we suspended campaigning to mark the sad passing of the Duke of Edinburgh.Seeing our communities come together to remember someone who gave over eight decades of military and public service was a poignant reminder of what is important.As parties resume campaigning as postal ballots arrive this week, it is time for East Lothianrsquos candidates to outline how they plan to make a dference for our communities.My campaign is focusing on our recovery from Covid-.I am presenting positive commitments to our towns and villages while, at the same time, warning of the risks of breaking up the United Kingdom.One of my top campaign priorities is education and this reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment and more teachers for our schools, to help give all our young people the very best start in le.Only a vote for me in the constituency vote, and only by casting your hugely important lsquoparty listrsquo vote for the Scottish Conservatives, can you guarantee education will be a top priority ndash rather than the fresh drive for another isive independence referendum.To find out more about my

where across Scotland The SNP is committed to public services: wersquoll give NHS staff a four per cent pay rise and introduce both a National Care Service and a National Wage for Carers.Nicola Sturgeon recently set out her aims to ldquobring on stream underused theatre capacity in community and general hospitals to treat more patients as day cases... including in East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.That is an immediate benefit, on our doorstep.Wersquore helping children to learn by ensuring they donrsquot go hungry at school and investing in social housing and fair rents in the private sector.Meeting housing needs must be guided by principles of social justice, equality and human rights: everyone is entitled to a home that supports health, wellbeing, job prospects and le chances.The SNPrsquos lsquoHousing to rsquo plan was initiated before the pandemic.Having consulted widely across Scotland, it is delivering a housing strategy putting people and communities first, with , affordable homes by  , including  per cent for social housing.The construction industry can benefit the economy and good-quality housing can transform lives.I believe voters trust the SNP to build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs Rebuilding an economy supporting public services will make Scotland the country we know it can be it needs the full powers of independence and I trust Nicola Sturgeonrsquos experienced leadership.To

a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

It told a familiar story.Yes, Scotland does better than other areas of the UK, London apart. However, we have problems with our birth rate, both in terms of population and business start-ups.Further, those businesses which do get going tend not to grow rapidly or signicantly. Our productivity is a concern: we need to ersy our economy, not least in the North Sea where oil and gas are declining assets.:Sturgeon versus Salmond. Here are the game plans for the socially distanced electionDo I see the mammoth twitch its ears at these comments  Perhaps, like the canine world, it is alert to the high-pitched whistles which customarily sound at such points.Dog whistle one, directed at supporters of opposition parties. It is all the fault of the incumbent Scottish or UK governments. If only they would adopt our policies.Up to a point, Lord Copper. Underlying economic problems in Scotland predate the present administrations. Indeed, they predate devolution.Dog whistle two, aimed at supporters of independence. The problems rest solely with the Union. Political independence would liberate our economy, permitting us to match the performance of our Nordic chums.The Oxford Economics report does say that some of the remedies to the problems they diagnose rest with UK action, notably on taxation. Further, they argue that Brexit has made the situation worse.However, they add that devolved Scotland needs to pay more heed ndash and cash ndash to the issue of economic development, while removing obstacles to growth.Perhaps we might consider that the solution need not lie solely with constitutional change. Supporters of independence do not have to take my word for that: they can read chapter and verse in another report, this one produced for the SNP.In , the partyrsquos Growth Commission, chaired by Andrew Wilson, produced a y and thoughtful study.Mr Wilson noted then that independence was no ldquomagic wand: that there was a need to be ldquocandid about the challenges, in addition to optimistic about the opportunities. He said hope must conquer fear but must also be ldquogrounded in clear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.This largely presaged the diagnosis set out in this weekrsquos Oxford Economics study but went on to generate a composite cure of its own making, focused upon the need to grow GDP through ldquoproductivity, population and participation.Tell me this. Are you hearing much in this election with regard to the economy which is either clear-sighted or rigorous  Are you hearing much in the way of detailed discourse at all Are you hearing instead voluble,inevitably inconclusive, argument about the date of the next independence referendum  From both sides of that debate.In the corner of the election room, the rough beast shakes its head, slowly and ponderously.When we hear such unalloyed promises, pests like me tend to ask ldquowhere is the money coming from  Such was always my habit and I am revisiting it in a podcast series being prepared for The Herald.From experience, replies y but, mostly, they range from unspecied growth to ldquoefficiency savings . If pressed, my interlocutors may argue that ldquowe cannot afford NOT to spend this money.:Independence and the SNP mdash The dream that hesitates to speak its nameIncidentally, they will always talk of ldquoinvestment, rather than ldquospending. Somehow, that irks me. I know, I know, pitiably petty, but there it is.Look, I get the concept. I know the notion is that we are investing in future generations. I applaud that endeavour. But let us not fool ourselves. Politicians talk of investment, rather than cash, because they know it is a comforting euphemism for the taxpayers.There is another element to this debate. This weekrsquos report presumes that we want to grow GDP, that it is an agreed objective,the methods remain disputed. But is that entirely true The Greens, for example, question the value of Gross Domestic Product as a touchstone. Nicola Sturgeon, too, has advanced the concept that we might need a dferent set of values, encompassing human well-being rather than financial growth.Again, I applaud this endeavour. It is right and proper to examine the basis upon which we found our polity.However, as Ms Sturgeon and others have recognised, we need to do more than to restate our objective as well-being. We need to define that objective itself and to specy policies which might generate advancement in pursuit of that aim.Otherwise, we risk substituting a warm glow for rigorous governmental policy, precisely as Andrew Wilson warned in his  report.

Itrsquos all too easy though, and comes risk-free. It demands little in the way of originality and much in callousness: somewhere an old woman is mourning the loss of a man who had been her le companion for the last  years. Sympathy costs nothing and enhances us vindictiveness reduces us.Angela Haggerty, the left-wing media commentator who springs from a working-class tradition, encapsulated this best when she tweeted: ldquoHaving lost my Dad in June and watching him become so frail, my emotional instinct at the death of Prince Philip is to feel sad for his family. Having a political view on the role of monarchy doesnrsquot require you to sacrice your personal humanity. Donrsquot let folk pressure you.Read more:Scotlandrsquos dismal political class have nothing to say to the poor or the youngYet, there was something manufactured and contrived in the reaction of the British establishment to the announcement of Philiprsquos death. Irsquom not surethere is a template somewhere that dictates the protocols for greeting the death of a long-standing prince consort. If such a concordat exists it surely didnrsquot envisage what we have witnessed over the two days.Itrsquos been reported that the Duke of Edinburgh didnrsquot want too much of a fuss to be made of his death and this seems to have been of a piece with his general approach to le. So, itrsquos probably safe to assume he would have greeted whatrsquos followed it with that grimace perfected by the male royals whenever they encounter something avid . Thus, an event that called for quiet and proportionate dignity was turned into something brash and braying. And the death of an old man became less of a tribute to whatever personal qualities he possessed than an opportunity to convey triumphalism.In recent years we have seen something of this in the way that the poppy, once a universal symbol of humble sacrice, has been distorted into a vampiric caricature. The weeks prior to November  now ring to the cries of poppy vigilantes hunting down those not deemed to be sufficiently enthusiastic about wearing this little red emblem of hope.Our publicly-funded broadcaster became BBC Windsor as it made a graven image of this man who, though essentially decent probably didnrsquot achieve much more than many otherstheyrsquod had access to the resources and personnel of the statersquos largesse. Their simpering coverage actually insulted those qualities they were eager to associate with him: dignity duty selflessness and a desire to make a quiet contribution.It was also tone deaf to the losses borne by , of us who have seen loved ones perish as coronavirus has moved through the land. The BBC has been an exemplar of fine public broadcasting in the way itrsquos conveyed the quiet dignity of many ordinary families who have endured grief in this pandemic. Many harbour a measure of affection for the royal family and the stability and fortitude they believe this institution still represents. I suspect though, that many too will be among the thousands who have registered complaints about the BBCrsquos gross lapse in editorial judgment.Read more:The British elite has failed utterly. Its time for Scotland to break freeThroughout the course of Saturday BBC presenters were made to wear black as a procession of plummy-voiced, public school Astors filed in to recreate what s deference sounded like. Here was the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby describing Prince Philip as ldquoa prophet. And over there a chaise longue of Tatler socialites describing him asa David Attenborough prototype an icon of religious unity and a pioneer of feminism: this for not making a fuss and stamping his feet at being made to walk two paces behind the Queen.The old fella, doubtless stf with boredom, simply did what most of the rest of us would have chosen to do ndash given the resources ndash at the prospect of a le consorting with myriad Trumpington-Llewellins and Sharpington-Dinsdales: he developed a rapid interest in exotic animals and wild places hellip the remoter the better. He wasnrsquot looking for medals, though.But medals are what he got from the BBC and an assortment of establishment lickspittles. By the time his funeral comes along on Saturday I fully expect a couple of miracles to be ascribed to his heavenly intervention and archbishop Welby to be naming a book of common prayer in his honour.You suspect though, that much of this stemmed from something more than the establishment getting carried away in a fugue of royalist fervour in readiness for the end of lockdown. They have made golden calves of these dysal German aristocrats, not because they hold them in anything approaching genuine admiration, but because their very existence sancties and reinforces the class system that underpins English society. In normalising this with daily obeisance to the House of Windsor it becomes embedded in the collective consciousness of those who, in other countries, would consider such an arrangement bizarre and unacceptable.In these countries they treat their royal families as mere state ambassadors who get to wear ceremonial dress occasionally as long as they donrsquot get too many ideas above their conferred status. In the UK they have been made into something much more insidious: the casual rendering of inequality and unearned privilege into something benign.This is what has been going on these last few days. At a human level though, it merely made a ridiculous spectacle of a man who, knowing hersquod married into privilege, seemed to have spent his days trying to use his advantages to spread a little decency: nothing more nothing less.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

According to the British Au Pair Agents Association , , young people come to the UK every year as au pairs, hundreds of whom work in Scotland. Many young Brits flow the opposite way. Unfortunately, this is now under threat, reducing childcare options and offering fewer opportunities for cultural cross-fertilisation.Au pairing is a mutually beneficial arrangement. From the perspective of the au pair, itrsquos an opportunity to spend time abroad and improve their language skills, with the additional benefit of free accommodation, a modest income and an automatic support network ndash all provided by the host family.For host families, often single-parent households or one where both parents work, it offers the option of affordable childcare and domestic support.Au pairs particularly suit parents with irregular working patterns, such as healthcare workers. During the pandemic, au pairs that my agency placed across Scotland stayed here throughout lockdown to support their host families.In some cases, this allowed frontline NHS workers to focus on the emergency at hand, safe in the knowledge their children were being looked after while they cared for those with Covid-. What are the options open to these parents without au pairs  Not everyone has family able to help and most nurseries are only open during the day.Without accessible and affordable childcare options, one parent ndash too often the mother ndash cannotto work.For this reason, the UK Governmentrsquos refusal to exempt au pairs from the salary requirements under the immigration system is concerning.Responding to concerns raised by the British Au Pair Agencies Association, the Home Office suggested that the childminding duties of foreign au pairs should be undertaken by those seeking new employment as a result of the Covid- pandemic.While I sympathise greatly with those who find themselves out of work due to the virus, I question how many Britons wish to work in exchange for bed and board with a host family and pound- per week \"pocket money\"ndash the usual arrangement for European au pairs, who are generally seeking experience and learning more than any signicant financial benefit.The Home Office also pointed to the Youth Mobility Scheme as a possible route for au pairs, but this is only open to citizens of a small number of select countries and the requirements are such that few au pairs would be eligible.Hiring an au pair is not right for everyone. But for some, an au pair is the best and most cost-effective childcare option. Au pairs arenrsquot a burden on the state ndash quite the opposite, as they allow tax-paying workers to continue in employment ndash and there isnrsquot a queue of Britons waiting to fill these roles.

The pain of her loss still rips through me, the memory of that le-altering phone call leaves me gasping for air in my darkest, most panicked hours. Truth be told, I havent stopped thinking about her. What  can we do in the wake of loss during a pandemic but stagnate in a pool of grief News that the BBC had offered staff grief counselling following the Duke of Edinburghrsquos death was ridiculed on social media, and I admit I was perplexed by the headline. How utterly ridiculous, I thought. Although tears glistened in some journalistsrsquo eyes as they delivered reports of his passing, I suspect their emotions were felt only by a small minority of their colleagues despite what the ceaseless coverage would have you believe.Abolishing the not proven verdict would be the first step to better justiceAfter a bit of digging it emerged the story wasnrsquot quite as it seemed staff had simply been signposted towards employee support services. That made sense. Irsquom sure there are several people who would benefit from a kindly ear right now, not because theyrsquore despondent about a -year-old member of the royal family shuffling off this mortal coil but because the inability to escape the news of it has dredged up the agony of their own losses.The UKrsquos Covid death toll has just surpassed , and the number of deaths throughout the country in total was more than , in . A study by a team of sociologists in America last year found that on average, nine loved ones are left behind for every person who dies from Covid-. That number just reflects the people impacted most deeply, such as spouses, siblings, children and parents. Once friends, colleagues and more distant relatives are taken into account, researcher Ashton Verdery said that number could be multiplied by  or more.By this measure, millions of us have grieved the death of someone we care about over the past year. Arguably, this is true most years. But what a strange and dficult time to be processing such a loss.There is no easy time to lose a person you love, obviously, but right now it hits dferently. Our natural impulse to comfort and console has been overridden by fear of a virus that has had us watching funerals on Zoom or attending them socially distanced and in small numbers.Before my aunt died I thought the former would be worse, but it isnrsquot, not by a long shot. There is no bleaker feeling than sitting on a pew wearing a tear-sodden face mask behind a row of shuddering shoulders, knowing itrsquos dangerous to hug them. Sorrows couldnrsquot be drowned afterwards, not together anyway. Emotional conversations were tinged with a fraught anxiety about getting too close. At a time when all we wanted to do was express ourselves freely and focus on the person we had loved so fiercely, the spectre of Covid hung in the space between us.There is an element of grief dficult to grapple with during normal times that the world keeps turning while yours has come to an abrupt halt. You see people laugh and donrsquot understand how thatrsquos possible. You look at newspapers and wonder why none of them are writing about your headline news, your person, the aching void theyrsquove left behind. You know the Auden poem: ldquoThe stars are not wanted now: put out every one Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun. But the world pausing in line with yours, the clocks being stopped, means little when you canrsquot commune with your loved ones. Nor can you hop back on lersquos carousel when the pain isnrsquot so searing. There are few distractions.We know the past year has taken its toll on our mental health I am not alone in how I feel. Grief has played a huge role in our collective consciousness as we have mourned the loss not only of othersrsquo lives but the way ours once was. The long-term impacts of grief are many and ied it is associated with depression and anxiety and can dramatically alter the course of a young personrsquos lethey lose a parent and do not receive the support they need.Poor mental health can affect anyone from any background and grief can incapacitate the most high-ing people you know, but the cushion of a decent job, of money, allows the most fortunate among us to afford private therapy or at least meet our basic needs on our heaviest days. Many do not have this privilege. It was revealed last month almost , calls to the ndash yes, overstretched and underfunded ndash NHS  mental health hub have gone unanswered throughout the pandemic. Figures published last year showed some young people in Scotland placed on waiting lists at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services for more than  weeks.The UK and Scottish Governments have committed vaguely to mental health recovery plans, but I worry whatever they come up with wonrsquot be enough to dig us out of this hole.

Mr Johnson replied: ldquoWhat, in these trousers  No, he didnrsquot, but we wouldnrsquot have been surprised.When Labour backbencher Ruth Cadbury asked when the PM had last met Mr Cameron, Boris came over all flakey and replied: ldquoThe honest truth, I cannot remember when I last spoke to Dave. He floundered again when Matt Westernput it to him that ldquoa fish rots from the head down. The PMrsquos cold-blooded reply merely confirmed widespread suspicion that he was taking the piscine.Next to carp was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who wanted to know how protecting childrenrsquos rights in Scotland threatened the Government in Westminster. This referred to the latter taking the Scottish Government to court over its incorporation into Scots law of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. Westminster believes this is outwith Holyroodrsquos competency.Mr Johnson, a leading incompetent, said the Scottish Government had only done this in the first place to cause ldquoconstitutional chaos, a claim perhaps attributing to the SNP more cunning than it possesses.Mr Blackford demanded that the PM withdraw the legal challenge, adding defiantly: ldquoIf not, wersquoll see you in court.Addressing the matter circuitously, Mr Johnson accused the SNP of doing all they could do to ldquobreak up this country, call for a referendum, er, em, break up this country, destroy our country hellip Yes, bash it, mash it, mangle it, rend it.

Far from giving up a \"glittering naval career\" to walk three steps behind Princess Elizabeth, Philip grabbed the opportunity to be catapulted from total anonymity into the centre of the wealthiest, most influential royal European family of the time and siring generations of kings. From being a stateless, penniless, rootless minor royal he then enjoyed a letime of unadulterated opulence, luxury and deference.True he had a chaotic, dysal, at times loveless, childhood with a mother who had serious mental health issues and a distant playboy father who didnrsquot let his lack of money affect his lavish lestyle in the South of France with his mistress. Good training, I would have thought, for joining the British royal family.The only fly in the ointment for Philip was his fury at being denied passing on his surname to his children.

But a few more cynical souls are starting to see more than a spectacle, they scent an opportunity for the national movement to finally jettison its more chauvinistic and counter-productive fringe.How Burdiehouse has been revealed as ground zero for a rediscovery of Scots lsquoexonymsrsquoIt is still not really clear what kind of party Mr Salmond is building: he has attracted several dferent clans of contrarians of social conservatives of leftists, of nationalists who are more flaggy than civic and, bluntly, of online conspiracists. Itrsquos quite the eclectic mix.It would be unfair to portray Alba purely as a problematically nationalistic project. Its membership is ied ndash as are the reasons why they have become disillusioned by the SNP. But there are signs some of its candidates and supporters feel, well, disinhibited.One campaign video this week starred the actor, Angus MacFadyen, who played Robert the Bruce in the s patriotic shlock gorefest Braveheart. Narrating pictures of saltire-waving protestors, he talked of ldquobreaking the spine of English superiorityrsquorsquo. Sturgeon backers winced, but almost gleefully. Itrsquos like the party has had a political enema and feels the better for it.But how,at all, will the SNP change without those members ndash and handful of politicians ndash who quit for Alba Not by much, insist those loyal to leader Nicola Sturgeon. Why  Because Mr Salmondrsquos backers had already been routed after trying to stage an insurrection inside the party. They left, in short, because they had lost.Even before the SNP civil war, Salmond supporters were already marginal, according to this line of thinking. ldquoThere are no lsquowharsquos like usrsquo nationalists in the leadership and not many in the membership either, said one party figure, talking about national chauvinists.But such nationalists, eventhey are a minority, do exist. And they can certainly make themselves visible. Some of them have proved incredibly off-putting to wavering indy-curious voters, especially on social media.Could Alba help detox the SNP of such ldquocybernats  Has Mr Salmond, like a pied piper, played a tune to march all of them away from the political front line James Mitchell is not sure. The professor of public policy at Edinburgh University has spent much of his career studying the anatomy of Scottish nationalism.ldquoDetoxication is just rhetoric politicians use when people previously seen as valued members leave, he said. ldquoThere may have been some desire to see some of Albarsquos people go but most of them were previously more than welcome.Mr Mitchell also stressed how hard it is to pigeonhole the kind of people who have defected to Alba and those who have stayed behind.Blair McDougall echoes this. A Labour strategist who led the pro-UK Better Together campaign ahead of the  independence referendum, he smells hypocrisy. ldquoThe same people who told us a few days ago that the aggressive, abusive ethnic nationalist minority didnrsquot exist in their party are now telling us that fringe has left, he said. ldquoSome have, some havenrsquot.Inside the SNP there is another answer to whether their movement, their party can detox: it depends on how well Mr Salmondrsquos party does.Alba, for them, could be the bin lorry that takes the SNPrsquos trash to the tip, to be forgotten forever. Or it could deliver the old rubbish right in to the chamber of the Scottish Parliament.Would that put a smell on the entire independence project  Maybe. Mainstream nationalist sources hope Ms Sturgeon could wave her hand under her nose and point towards Mr Salmond. It is not her stench, after all.Her former mentor was once also a part of the great sht of the SNP away from being unelectable eccentrics to what appears, for the time being at least, to be the natural party of devolved government. But that was before Mr Salmond lost the  indyref, lashed out at the media and wound up fronting a chat show on Vladimir Putinrsquos premier western mouthpiece, RT.It does not look like Ms Sturgeonrsquos opponents will let her forget Mr Salmondhe was lurking on the back benches. But would the SNP have to look and sound more impatient about independence to shore up its more nationalist flank Mr McDougall senses that Ms Sturgeon is already being dragged away from the constitutional centre ground to try and protect her more nationalist flank.ldquoThe cautiousness on timing of attempting another vote has been replaced by an urgency that isnrsquot shared by the swing voters who are much more lsquonot never, but certainly not nowrsquo, he said.SNP sources, on the contrary, expect their leader to be pragmatic and to put as much clear, saltire-blue sea between her and Mr Salmond as possible.Right now it is hard to know how Alba will perform next month. Most pollsters suggest the start-up is dead-on-arrival, not least because of the personal approval ratings of its leader.However, two surveys, by the same firm, give Alba just enough votes to deliver some MSPs and, potentially, cost the SNP its overall majority.Leading Scots fishing skipper facing fines of pound, for illegal dredgingDefeat means less exposure, especially on TV.

It was not altogether long ago that Sir Keir entered his sixth month of beating Prime Minister Boris Johnson in head-to-head polling .From Labourrsquos perspective, Sir Keir is in the eye of the vaccine storm. For every journalist, commentator, citizen lamenting the UK governmentrsquos handling of the Covid pandemic in its early stages, there is now one lavishing praise on its world-leading vaccine rollout.Boris bet the house on the vaccine, and won.It is an inevitability of human behaviour that the public will be, to a degree, beholden to the leader who oversees a route out of the most calamitous event of their lives all the more so when they see near neighbours across the English Channel moving in the opposite direction.For Sir Keir, however, all is far from lost. Were there an idiom for Labour, it would be ldquowhere there is time, there is hope. And there is time.Sir Keirrsquos ultimate electoral test may not come for three-and-a-half years, during which much can change. By then, we assume, the acute pandemic will be over and Covid, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, has indicated, will be treated much like the annual influenza.Furthermore, we will be locked into what will inevitably be a hugely painful recovery. Unemployment will be higher. Taxes too, probably. Interest rates, perhaps. In other words, our Potemkin economy will have lost its facade.And there is little doubt, at least in my mind, that Sir Keir is the right person to take advantage of that political and economic environment when it emerges. His move to Downing Street is far from locked-in writing off Mr Johnson is a foolrsquos errand, and he is at least as deserving of the Comeback Kid moniker as its more famous owner, President Bill Clinton.However, it seems to me that those in the Labour Party who doubt it made the right choice seem to believe they live in a country inhabited by a mythical population of committed socialists. They donrsquot.It is unclear what more empirical evidence is required to make them understand this. Tony Blair won three elections for the first time in the partyrsquos history, because of centrist politics and economics, before the party gradually deteriorated over the following  years as it steadily moved further and further to the left. A centrist resurgence in the form of Sir Keir immediately flipped the polls. Some things in politics are simple. This is one of them.In Labour land, Sir Keirrsquos job is not the only one occupied by the right person. Enter Anas Sarwar, the star-so-far of the Holyrood election campaign, having clearly won the first leadersrsquo debate, and emerged from the second with at least a score draw.Much like Sir Keir, Mr Sarwar is a man with time on his hands. The worst possible thing he could have done, having replaced his predecessor so soon before an election, would have been to over-promise before inevitably under-delivering.He has assiduously avoided taking that well-trodden path, so much so that he appears to have already started telling his - story, ready for a tilt at Bute House in five years time.That is by no means a fancul prospect. For the Labour Party sits on electoral gold, which can be cashed inand when the second independence referendum is called, and can accumulate value after it is over.We are currently locked in constitutional polarisation, with the two poles occupied by the SNP and the Tories. This will change, particularlythe SNP wins a majority next month. The denial of a democratic request, for a second referendum, will see the Tories become as isolated as they were in the s Labour will surely avoid falling into that hole alongside them, and will endorse a referendum.At that point, Mr Sarwar will be in a position to grasp the leadership of the pro-UK lobby, with he and Sir Keir advocating the sort of enhanced devolutionary agenda which historic polling has always shown to be the likeliest vote winner.A third way on the constitutional question, sensible economic policy, a partnership with an equally sensible Labour leader in London. In a post-referendum environment, those are enviable attributes, and could see Mr Sarwar with a realistic prospect of being First Minister in , by which time the SNP will have been in power for almost two decades.And whilst Scottish Labour has a distance to travel in terms of voting intention, it has much less far to go in terms of voter trust. This monthrsquos Ipsos MORI polling for STV showed Labour, again, recording very solid figures on whether the people trust them to run public services and the economy, and to stand up for Scotlandrsquos interests. They remain well behind the SNP, as we might expect, but on each of these measures they are ahead of the Tories, despite trailing them in voting intention.In other words, people are ready to, and want to, vote Labour again, when they see sensible, relatable leadership , and when they see a credible position on the constitution .Not so long ago, many commentators, me included, wondered out loud whether Labour was dead, north and south of the border. We were wrong. They are not. The rose is still wilted, but this is Labourrsquos spring.Be patient, I say. Summer is coming.Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

However, there have to be rules, strict rules, so those who govern us are not unduly influenced by malign forces.Companies, of course, like the kudos of having an ex-senior minister on their books.They believe it impresses others and, when the time comes, may give up some useful inside intelligence or, as in the case of Mr Cameron ndash who insists he has not broken any rules on lobbying ndash a handy hotline to Downing Street.One of the many surprising aspects about what has now been branded a scandal is that the former PM, a multi-millionaire before, during and after leaving office, felt the need to work for Lex Greensill at all.But, clearly, the prospect of trousering an extra poundm in share options working for a former No  aide in his finance company was too good an opportunity to miss.Back-scratching, it seems, has become a lucrative art form.The problem with ministers becoming lobbyists is, post their time in government, a suspicion always lingers that during their final months in Whitehall their focus was not on the public job in hand but on the private one to come.It would be shameful enoughthis sorry saga was just about an ex-premier trying to line his pockets but the collapse of Greensill Capital could well lead to thousands of people losing their jobs in the steel industry.Founded by the Australian financier, the company specialised in supply-chain finance, settling business bills immediately for a fee and so helping eliminate the problem of late payments.Indeed, in  Greensill won a poundm contract from the Cabinet Office that gave pharmacies the option of being paid early for NHS prescriptions.Astonishingly, it has now emerged that Bill Crothers, a former top official responsible for overseeing billions of pounds in the UK Governmentrsquos commercial contracts, was employed by Mr Greensill part-time while still working in Whitehall.He formally left in  and subsequently became a director of Greensill, where he is said to have held a stake worth poundm.Now, Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, has issued an urgent demand that any moonlighting civil servant should come forward. This, incredibly, suggests the head of the civil service has no idea what might be going on in the workforce he runs.Politically, Lobbygate has come just at the right time for the UK Governmentrsquos political opponents as people consider who to vote for in a raft of elections in Scotland, England and Wales.Keir Starmer clearly relished announcing to the nation that our old friend Tory sleaze was back and during PMQs sought to connect the dots to a web of Conservative cronyism.The Labour leader even managed a witty reference to the BBCrsquos popular crime drama Line Of Duty, telling Boris Johnson: ldquoThe more I listen to the Prime Minister, the more I think Ted Hastings and AC- is needed to get to the bottom of this one.Labourrsquos attempt to get a fully independent inquiry to take a comprehensive look at lobbying was always set to fall foul of the Commons arithmetic. Yet House committees are now falling over themselves to probe the subject, which must be causing nerves to jangle in Tory circles at Westminster and beyond.Whatever the Government-appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman recommends in June must command public confidence and support. The current system clearly has too many holes and needs a substantial overhaul otherwise we will be back here yet again in a few yearsrsquo time.Voters must feel they can trust not only those who govern them but also the systems of government.The wily ex-minister Lord Pickles, who chairs the toothless Advisory Committee on Business Appointments which advises ex-ministers and civil servants on outside employment, told MPs yesterday, with a deal of understatement, there were ldquoanomalies in the system that required ldquoimmediate address and that the Crothersrsquo case showed there did ldquonot seem to have been any boundaries at all.Conspicuous by his silence in this whole affair is Mr Greensill. Will he, like Mr Cameron and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, offer to place place himself under the parliamentary microscope  He should.Yet for all Labourrsquos understandable outrage at what they brand Tory sleaze and cronyism, they should know occupying the high moral ground carries a health warning as all politicians live in glasshouses and while today one party might be lobbing stones, tomorrow they might be on the receiving end.Now that several official inquiries are under way into ious aspects of Lobbygate, more shocking revelations could well lead us all to experience one or more of Ted Hastingsrsquo memorable ldquoMother of God moments.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I am neither fanatical nor blinkered about the SNPs governance of our country and am certainly not afraid to challenge when necessary. I do not rant on social media or engage in anti-social behaviour. I am a retired academic, busy grandmother and wholly peaceful in pursuing my political beliefs.Like many thousands, I joined the SNP after the referendum in , sickened by the contempt of the fake united oppositions \"pledge\" to Scots which disintegrated within  hours of the No result.My support for the SNP is maintained by the many improvements to Scottish le achieved by the Scottish Government but also by the howling injustices of Brexit and by being governed by a Westminster highly-privileged elite for which my country didnt vote, and whose policies are so far removed from any reflection of my own values and beliefs as to be almost alien. The UK Conservative Government has repeatedly shown itself to be mired in distasteful hypocrisy, displays a brutal and continuing disdain for the least advantaged and has positioned itself above meaningful scrutiny and accountability. Any support for it must surely require abandoning any belief in decency. Scotland does not deserve to be tarnished by this shamefulness under global scrutiny. In Scotland we at least know how to hold our leaders to account.So, a request to detractors. Please do not assume you know or understand, or can easily typy my support for the SNP. We are a very broad movement with at least one common belief, that an independent Scotland has the knowledge, skills, resources and passion to look after our affairs and to flourish in, and make a signicant contribution to, a fairer world.Dr Brenda Gillies, Newport on Tay.CYNICISM PLUMBS NEW DEPTHSTHE most striking thing of all about the present Scottish election campaign is that the party which has ruled the roost for  years, with the swathe of powers it has, acts asit has been in opposition all that time. It is very disconcerting, this \"elect us and we will straighten it all outrsquorsquo line it uses. Where have its leaders been and what have they been doing for  years The most glaring example of this is in the education of our children, where in surely the most cynical of all their moves, a long-awaited and long-delayed report on how the youngsters of this country are being educated is once more shelved and hidden from us until after the election. In the meantime a handful of goodies is dished out willy-nilly. Cynicism in Scotland is now at a new, to-date-unplumbed, level. Meanwhile, our councils remain starved of funds and we retain the highest drugs deaths in Europe title.It is so disturbing and so obvious it is hard to see how any caring and concerned parent, in fact how anyone, could be taken in by such tactics.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.ECONOMICS OF THE PLAYGROUNDPATRICK Harvie, co-leader of the wholly-owned SNP subsidiary, the Scottish Greens, announces a ldquomillionaires tax in his election manesto . He states this is ldquonot a tax on aspiring to have wealth, it is a tax on having wealth. It is all too frequent that we hear politicians with no economic background espousing their economic illiteracy, but his statement really tops the pile.In essence he is saying go ahead and dream of creating wealth not just for yourself but also others and of course pay tax on the way to creating that wealth. However be warned: when you have created that wealth, paid tax during the creation of that wealth and indeed perhaps created employment and opportunities for others, we are coming after you for more money.I look forward to Mr Harvie and his colleagues endeavouring to explain where they fit in ldquoaspiration\" in wealth creation when it is simply to be taxed out of existence when that aspiration and success have been achieved. It is the economics of the playground and should he ever get his hands on the till it would spell economic catastrophe for Scotland.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.* THE poorer might be better off under the devolved taxation system in Scotlandbut the figures are illuminating. The SNP headline boast about most people paying less tax is nominally true but the figures show the real picture. Any Scot on pound, is pound, worse off yet the maximum benefit for lower-paid workers is a mere pound tax reduction. A more stark example of SNP spin is hard to find.The net result of the Scottish taxation system is that lower-paid workers are being short-changed and higher-paid workers will see the opportunities down south as even more attractive. Where is Scotland going to get all the highly trained people for industry, education and health that we so desperately need The other sting in the tail is that the more high-paid workers Scotland loses, the more taxation will need to be raised from those who are left.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer.

After all, the near legendary ‘unsinkable ship’ was built on the slipways and docks of Harland and Wolff.We have flocked to see several epic movies about the disaster and watched fascinated as deep sea submersibles have traversed the wreck of the ship.Who can forget the elaborate chandelier apearing out of the murk when the first cameras were sent into the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic.But only a small number of local people will be aware that Alexander Carlisle who led the initial design team for the project was from Ballymena.With the help of a few sources we hope to make the link between the City of the Seven Towers and the most famous ship in history.Perhaps the best article on Carlisle’s role has been penned by Paul Louden-Brown FRSA for the Titanic Belfast website. And he begins his exploration by asking why so many people have credited the much more famous Thomas Andrews, played by Victor Garber in the enormously successful  movie, with the design. Louden-Brown argues that Thomas Andrews did not design Titanic or her sister ships Olympic and Britannic.He states, unequivicolly that the man who deserves credit for the design is Alexander Carlisle.He writes: “So why, when so much is written and talked about Titanic, has such a mistake been made  The answer lies partly in the power of film.“In  Walter Lord’s best seller ‘A Night to Remember’ about the Titanic disaster was turned into a feature film.“The film’s screenplay, outside of the author’s control, featured a degree of dramatic license in order to increase the impact of the story.“ The first of these dramatizations was the launch of Titanic - the White Star Line held no formal naming ceremony for their steamships and Titanic was no exception - yet in the film a lady names the vessel and breaks a bottle of champagne over the bows.“I asked Bill MacQuitty, the Belfast-born producer of the film, who, as a child, witnessed the launch of Titanic, why he included an invented scene in his film “His answer was revealing ‘because it’s what an audience expects to see at the launch of a ship.’ The same, he said, applied to Thomas Andrews’ characterization.“The idea of the designer of the ship going down with his creation, while the owner escaped in a leboat, was too good a storyline to ignore.”Louden Brown continues: “MacQuitty was well aware who really designed Titanic and that J. Bruce Ismay was not a coward but his primary concern was turning an historical event into a commercially successful feature film.“ In that respect he succeeded and ‘A Night to Remember’ remains the definitive version with Titanic enthusiasts and the public alike.“The film’s influence is clear to see. James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Titanic’ also re-enforced Andrews’ position as ‘designer’ in a similar caricaturization to that used by MacQuitty almost forty years before.”Countless books, magazine articles, TV documentaries and even a set of th anniversary stamps featuring an image of Andrews all reinforce the misconception that he designed the ship - the invented story is just too powerful.Louden Brown continues: “None of this uncomfortable truth is intended to take anything away from the reputation of Thomas Andrews he was a brave man and did his duty.“He died helping others and his name is properly honoured in the country of his birth but he does not deserve credit for designing the ‘Olympic’ class liners that honour belongs to Carlisle.“The man who designed Titanic was born in Ballymena, Co. Antrim on  July . Alexander Montgomery Carlisle, eldest of five children and the son of John Carlisle, Headmaster of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, was educated at his father’s school.In , aged sixteen, he began work at Harland  Wolff as a premium apprentice. Serving alongside him for the next five years was his friend, fellow apprentice and future brother-in-law William James Pirrie . The two young men were destined to play a leading role in the development of Harland  Wolff.In April  Carlisle married American born Edith Wooster, twelve years his junior, at the First Congregational Church in San Francisco.The couple had two daughters and a son and, as Carlisle was steadily promoted, the family purchased a large red brick house in Elmwood Avenue near Queen’s University.In  Carlisle was made chief naval architect at the yard and from this date he designed some of most famous liners belonging to the White Star Line amongst the long list were Teutonic, Cymric, Oceanic, Adriatic and finally the ‘Olympic’ class liners.As Manager his redevelopment plan of the yard in order to facilitate the construction of the world’s largest liners transformed Harland  Wolff into a virtual factory production line.At the end of June  he resigned from the positions of General Manager and Chairman of Managing Directors at the relatively young age of fty-five - the reason for his decision to resign are unknown. Remarkably he had never taken a day’s sick leave since joining the firm.Universally popular with the workforce, who nicknamed him ‘Big Alec’, the growing issue of Home Rule and the political instability of the period may have contributed towards his decision to leave. At the time of his retirement Carlisle split his time between his homes in Belfast and  Hyde Park Place, Londonsup.His designs for the ‘Olympic’ class were completed with both vessels under construction Olympic plated and just four months away from launching and Titanic in frame.Thomas Andrews’ involvement, from July onwards, was to take up where Carlisle had left off in the management of a project where the major designs decisions had been completed several years before.Continued from page : Louden-Brown ‘s article continues: The disaster which overtook Carlisle’s last creation was said to have broken his heart.Called to give evidence at the British enquiry into the loss and asked about his role in the design of Titanic, he explained that he was in charge of turning the concept for the ‘Olympic’ class into design reality.Both ships, he said, were ‘entirely designed practically by Lord Pirrie. The details, the decorations, the equipment and the general arrangements all came under me.’Carlisle was being modest about his influence and abilities. His ‘signature style’ for the White Star fleet was well established by the s the proportions of the hull to the upper works, rake of the funnels, spacing of the masts, design of the bridge front and more, gave each vessel an unmistakable and identiable White Star look.Lord Pirrie’s opinions on the design, or otherwise, were not sought by Lord Mersey and it remains a signicant oversight that he was not called to give evidence, or asked to provide even a written statement, particularly with regard to the decision made regarding the number of leboats provided on each ship.Carlisle placed blame for the lack of leboats with the White Star management.It was Carlisle who outlined the design of what became the Welin Quadrant Davit system, capable of handling up to twice the number of leboatsthe Board of Trade regulations required, but the owners made the decision to reduce this number to just  with four collapsibles.The famous shipbuilder always followed his own inclinations having scant respect for convention.In February  he was arrested on a Coroner’s warrant for failing to attend the inquest into the death of a workman killed in the yard. On promising to attend the adjourned inquest he was released.He was made an Irish Privy Councillor by King Edward in . Like Pirrie, Carlisle became a Home Ruler - campaigning for an indpendent Irish Parliament within the Imperial context.Carlisle, a keen collector of autographs, counted amongst his collection many prominent personalties including those of King George and Kaiser Wilhelm.He met the Kaiser on a number of occasions before the First World War. His eldest daughter married Baron Frederick von Versen, one of the Kaiser’s aides, and in  when visiting the married couple in Berlin he was entertained by the Kaiser.The two men were formally introduced at the unveiling of Queen Victoria’s memorial in front of Buckingham Palace in  and they met again when he was a guest at a famous supper party after one of the Kiel yachting regattas.A noted Germanophile, the Ulsterman was certainly impressed with all things Germanic and made several Atlantic crossings in the liners Amerika, Kaiserin Auguste Victoria and Imperatorit appears his tastes were better satisfied by the lavish surroundings in the German liners.Long after the war, anti-German sentiment still prevailed in Britain but it did not bother him.It was rumoured that a rt existed between Carlisle and his brother-in-law Lord Pirrie, but no reason has been offered as to why this should have been the case. The most plausible explanation was Carlisle’s Bohemian tastes, his close ties with the Kaiser, popularity with the workmen in the yard and his plans to join the Labour party and stand as a Parliamentary candidate.The many statements he made about German shipbuilding ‘they are equal in every way to us as shipbuilders and operators’ and his prophesy that they would once again compete with the British in the size and speed of ocean liners and his left wing politics did nothing to endear him to the Chairman of Harland  Wolff.For Pirrie, a Liberal but conservative by nature and by now a rising star of the British establishment, the idea of a relative with known German sympathies making statements like this and with a daughter married to a former aide of the Kaiser was galling enough, but,he had lived long enough to discover Carlisle also planned to visit his old friend the now ex-Kaiser, it would probably have ended their relationship.Eighteen months after Pirrie’s death in November  Carlisle did just that and visited Wilhelm exiled at Doorn in the Netherlands he said at the time ‘My friends tell me that it was an extra-ordinary thing for a British subject to accept the hospitality of the former War Lord, whose subjects, military and civilian, chanted the Hymn of Hate, but I am an unconventional man.’He stayed for a weekend and in some style the standards the Kaiser was used to in the old days at Potsdam were still kept up. He brought along his autograph book and the two men reminisced about many of the famous names the book contained and, le before the war. Carlisle had been unwell for sometime with heart and lung problems, and during his stay ‘took a chill’.Defining convention to the very end he organized and paid for his funeral in advance, proudly showing off to family and friends the framed cremation certicate that cost pound s d and telling them how cheap it was to dispose of himself in this way and that it was time he disappeared from this earthly stage.That time came on  March  at his London home and three days later, on the th, his funeral, as arranged, took place at Golders Green in North West London. The German theme continued with light music - Schubert’s ‘Reminiscences’ and ‘Nachtstuck’ and an Allegretto by Mendelssohn - played by an organist who was also paid in advance. There was no clergyman present, no formal religious rites were observed, no hymns were sung and no prayers were recited. The small group of mourners included his two daughters, sisters Viscountess Pirrie, Mrs Hunter and several family friends. After the cremation he left instructions for the ‘Merry Widow’ waltz to be played as his ashes were scattered in the Garden of Rest. ‘I am sure it will be more agreeable than the dead march from “Saul”’, he had remarked.So ended the le of a remarkable man. During his letime Carlisle had overseen the tremendous growth in world shipbuilding and his own part, pivotal in transforming the emigrant ship into a virtual floating city and the need for improved le saving appliances in the new generation of large passenger liners, but his plans were ignored. Many of the obituaries published in Britain omitted mention of Titanic, still a painful subject even in . In other countries that was not the case and he was given the credit he deserved for his far sighted designs and for the influence he made on British and world shipbuilding, denied him in modern times because of the power of film, the very thing, paradoxically, that has been largely responsible for keeping the story of Titanic alive.

We supported the students in the institutions that we publicly fund here in Northern Ireland.Students in GB and Northern Ireland will be able to claim funding from the universities they attend.Some £m additional was made available for student hardship in Scotland, £m in England and around £m in Wales.There are currently around , students in third level education in Northern Ireland. But three-quarters are excluded from the grants as they are studying in Further Educational colleges where they are only eligible to receive a one-off payment of £ to address digital poverty.In March, Stormont passed a motion calling on the Economy Minister to extend the Covid Disruption Payment to include all those previously excluded, but President of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland Ellen Fearon said many had been left feeling undervalued.All students have faced severe disruption this year, and all students deserve better than the support this government has provided for them, she said.The Economy Minister has said multiple times that she believes that developing skills is vital for building Northern Ireland#s future, so why isn#t she making sure that the people who are developing their skills in further education colleges across the country have the financial backing they need The NI Assembly passed a motion calling on this payment to be extended and it#s now imperative that the Minister follows this through.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest EducationSport to recommence at Northern Ireland schools, Weir tells principalsEducation system #can learn from Covid crisis#Mark BainOpinionCorridors buzzing again as friends reunited at lastEducation Minister Peter Weir hailsof Northern Ireland#s school pupilsLatest from Belfast Tribute: wreaths laid to mark th anniversary of Belfast BlitzDon#t suffer in silence with negative thoughts, warns young NI footballer Stewart NixonQuestions over ex-police chief#s IRA murder claimLine of Duty: How AC-#s Ted Hastings became the most adored copper on TVDebenhams closing down sale to lead the way when retail reopens,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Every day I speak with business owners who are in distress and despair and were becoming devoid of hope. We firmly believed that the amazing speed and scale of the vaccination roll-out and the continually improving health data justied giving those businesses indicative dates for reopening. Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are signicantly better than those mooted in the media yesterday morning. They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeks# time.We welcome the Executive#s decision and the fact that Ministers have listened to and responded positively to the concerns expressed by businesses and the genuine fears they had about their futures and the jobs of their staff. We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our city#s economy.Simon Hamilton is chief executive of Belfast ChamberNo, says Conor BrowneI do not have a problem with outdoor activities being increased in Northern Ireland. There is no issue with outdoor table service in bars or restaurants, as long as social distancing is maintained.However, the Executive announced an indicative date for eating and drinking indoors on May .We have known for a long time in the biosecurity community that the single most dangerous place and activity that you can engage in, is groups of people inside and not wearing masks. That indicative date is a little bit too close. Whenever you release restrictions from a lockdown, you should do it in a slow manner.If you make a big change like opening close contact services and outdoor hospitality, what you want to do is wait and see what that does to the number of people who get infected with the virus and also to the number of hospital admissions.I want the economy back but my concern is thatwe move too quickly on everything, then we run the risk of infection rates spiking again and we end up going back into another lockdown of some description.I do not want to go back into another lockdown and neither does the business community but, for me, the big issue is hospitality indoors. I would like to see a little bit more time passing before we start thinking about getting people indoors.We are doing exceptionally well with our vaccination programme but the problem is there are some iants of the virus - in particular the South African iant.The vast majority of people going out will be young people, who will be unvaccinated, and could potentially lead to a spread of the South African iant in Northern Ireland.Conor Browne is a biosecurity consultant specialising in Covid- business continuity, forecasting, and analysisBelfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest CoronavirusNI universities get £m to handle Covid hardship fund for studentsHotels hiring staff, but restaurants fear tough times aheadNorthern Ireland#s Covid- lockdown announcements receive a mixed response from the publicLockdown lting: Your key questions answered Latest from Belfast Simon Byrne defends tweet naming officer on NI football team#Barbaric# shooting of man in west Belfast condemnedNI universities get £m to handle Covid hardship fund for studentsTribute: wreaths laid to mark th anniversary of Belfast BlitzDon#t suffer in silence with negative thoughts, warns young NI footballer Stewart Nixon,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is poised to recommend a series of relaxations during Thursday#s meeting of the Executive.He also said he wants to provide indicative dates to help businesses to prepare for reopening as Covid fatigue risks itself mutating into Covid despair.Meanwhile, the chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said he believes the vaccination programme has saved hundreds of lives across Northern Ireland, adding that we have made signicant progress since the dark days of winter.He declared: I believe we are on the cusp of better, happier times.At a Department of Health Press conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said: We still have work to do in combating this virus and while we must never be complacent, it is undoubtedly the case that very signicant progress has been made.This is a suitable time to pay tribute to the collective determination of all the people across Northern Ireland. We have maintained and observed effective restrictions from Boxing Day until Easter - that has required remarkable commitment and incredible sacrices.Many lives have been saved as a result, intolerable pressures have been lted from our health service, and now we can step cautiously into a new environment. The scales are tipping in favour of relaxations of some of our restrictions and being able to accelerate that process.Mr Swann said he wants to give people more opportunities to meet up with family and friends outdoors in as safe a way as possible.The UUP minister continued: And yes, for those staff members that I met this morning in the South Lake vaccine centre and their #asks#, like many others, it should also mean getting back to the hairdressers and back to the barbers, as it should mean more businesses opening and considering even more people getting back to their caravans earlier than we would have previously thought.To all those who have been bending my ear and making those asks, let me just say to them, I have listened to you and I hear you.I can confirm that my department has now fed into the central process and whilst I will not pre-empt any decisions ahead of tomorrow#s Executive, I do hope the agreed review will show clear signs of positivity and progress after it.Paying tribute to the public for following guidance, and health and social care staff for their dedication throughout the pandemic, Dr McBride said the reduction in infections has been down to the effectiveness of the lockdown.He said: You have helped us get this virus under control and you have saved many, many lives.We now thankfully have some head room and some opportunity for some restrictions to be eased on a phased basis as the Executive#s pathway intended.Dr McBride also stressed that UK regulators have said the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective as he urged anyone who is eligible for a vaccine to make an appointment as soon as possible.It is the right thing to do, this is our passport to better times, he said.I know there will be some concerns and while no medicine, no vaccine is without risk, the UK and EU regulators have again confirmed that these are safe and effective vaccines and the benefits far outweigh any potential side effects for the vast majority of people.I believe vaccination has already saved hundreds of lives in Northern Ireland and it will save more so we need to maintain the momentum and get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible. I believe we are on the cusp of better, happier times and vaccination is central to getting us there. Northern Ireland on Wednesday recorded another death linked to Covid-, while  new cases of the virus have been diagnosed. There were  Covid- inpatients, of which eight were in intensive care and four care home outbreaks.Belfast Related ContentPlayCoronavirus PremiumVideo: The five sectors eagerly awaiting decision on easing restrictionsThe Executive is set to hold a crunch meeting today to discuss the easing of lockdown restrictions, with many eagerly awaiting news of what sectors are to open up.Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest CoronavirusNI universities get £m to handle Covid hardship fund for studentsHotels hiring staff, but restaurants fear tough times aheadSimon Hamilton and Conor BrowneOpinionIs this raft of reopening dates the best way ahead Northern Ireland#s Covid- lockdown announcements receive a mixed response from the publicLockdown lting: Your key questions answered Latest from Belfast #I know now I#m not a dirty little secret... we were all abused#Titanic disaster: Wreaths laid for victims on th anniversaryKillultagh Holdings: Losses rise to £m for leading NI property firmSimon Byrne defends tweet naming officer on NI football team#Barbaric# shooting of man in west Belfast condemned,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In fact, the girl told me it would be Dr Danny Acton, who works at Altnagelvin, who would be operating.I went to the Galway Clinic and it was like booking into a five-star hotel. The rooms, the food... everything was amazing.I had my operation the following day and a couple of days later I was back home in Derry.Prior to the procedure, Mrs McCarron was on high-strength painkillers.She said: Although I am not fully recovered, I am on half the number of painkillers that I had been taking.I had been taking high levels of tramadol and naproxen, which are very addictive. I was worried about that, but I really can manage the pain now with paracetamol. If I continue the way I have been, I think it will be no time before I don#t need any pain relief.After struggling for eight long years, where I couldn#t even go shopping, I now have something to look forward to.An initiative launched by the trust at the end of March means that people like Mrs McCarron, who have spent years lingering on orthopaedic waiting lists, are now getting their operations.A spokesman for the Western Trust explained: The trust was asked, along with other trusts providing orthopaedic services, to seek out capacity in the independent sector across Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic. This capacity was then utilised after a contract was established to treat patients prior to the end of March .Given the challenges faced by the trust to restart elective services and the signicant backlog of patients awaiting treatment, the trust welcomes the continuation of the contract with the Health and Social Care Board at the North West Independent Clinic to provide theatres and staffing for NHS surgeons to work there as part of their NHS contract.The trust also welcomes any additional funding that can be made available to continue to treat patients through contracts with other independent sector providers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern IrelandNI#s trade with Republic booming since BrexitCall for review into long-delayed motorway link to be made public#I know now I#m not a dirty little secret... we were all abused#: Survivor of NI#s mother and baby homes tells of the shadow cast over her leTitanic disaster: Wreaths laid for victims on th anniversaryLatest from Belfast NI#s trade with Republic booming since BrexitCall for review into long-delayed motorway link to be made public#I know now I#m not a dirty little secret... we were all abused#: Survivor of NI#s mother and baby homes tells of the shadow cast over her leTitanic disaster: Wreaths laid for victims on th anniversaryKillultagh Holdings: Losses rise to £m for leading NI property firm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Loyalist paramilitary sources say while they are not responsible for orchestrating the protests they will also not do anything to stop them.

Despite the Loyalist Communities Council releasing a statement calling for calm on Friday, there are still those within the organisation who refused to condemn the violence, leading to a dispute among senior members of the umbrella group.The LCC, which represents the UVF, factions of the UDA, and Red Hand Commando, said none of their associated groups have been involved, either directly or indirectly, in the violence.However, the Belfastunderstands that members of the paramilitary organisations and affiliated bands will be participating in the protests.SDLP MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly condemned the plans as reckless.We are still in a Covid pandemic, I have sisters who work in nursing and I don#t know that NHS staff could go through a third wave, bringing crowds onto the street at this time is totally reckless.This brings flashbacks to the worst days of the Drumcree protests, that spiralled into violence, including - some people forget - the murder of a policeman, Frankie O#Reilly.Mr O#Reilly, an RUC constable, was injured by a blast bomb thrown during clashes with loyalists in Portadown in , He died from his injuries after spending four weeks on a le support.Mrs Kelly added: There really is a real need for leadership within unionist parties, not upping the ante about the Protocol, or talk of two tier policing or myths around deprivation, whenever there is very little dference for those living on the Falls or the Shankill in terms of deprivation.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern IrelandCall for review into long-delayed motorway link to be made public#I know now I#m not a dirty little secret... we were all abused#: Survivor of NI#s mother and baby homes tells of the shadow cast over her leTitanic disaster: Wreaths laid for victims on th anniversaryKillultagh Holdings: Losses rise to £m for leading NI property firmSimon Byrne defends tweet naming officer on NI football teamLatest from Belfast Call for review into long-delayed motorway link to be made public#I know now I#m not a dirty little secret... we were all abused#: Survivor of NI#s mother and baby homes tells of the shadow cast over her leTitanic disaster: Wreaths laid for victims on th anniversaryKillultagh Holdings: Losses rise to £m for leading NI property firmSimon Byrne defends tweet naming officer on NI football team,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A booby-trap bomb planted under his car exploded outside his home in Omagh in April .Several other officers have been injured in attempted murders over the years, including Peadar Heffron, who suffered le-changing injuries in an under-car bomb attack in .In January last year, there was attempt to kill an off-duty officer at the front door of his home in Co Fermanagh. He was confronted by a masked man aiming a shotgun at him. However he did not fire and fled the area.Due to the threat posed by dissidents, it has long been policy to avoid publicly identying officers, apart from those in senior public-facing roles.In recent weeks, disorder across Northern Ireland has seen PSNI officers attacked by rioters from both loyalist and nationalist areas. It has been those from loyalist areas, however, who have been largely inciting the violence over their opposition to the Irish Sea border, perceived two-tier policing and the fallout from the decision not to prosecute Sinn Fein members over the Bobby Storey funeral controversy, among other issues.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: #Landmark day# as Executive confirms reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality by end of AprilLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceSimon Byrne had #full agreement# to name PSNI officer following Northern Ireland women#s football team victoryNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern Ireland#Barbaric# shooting of man in west Belfast condemnedNI universities get £m to handle Covid hardship fund for studentsTribute: wreaths laid to mark th anniversary of Belfast BlitzDon#t suffer in silence with negative thoughts, warns young NI footballer Stewart NixonLatest from Belfast #Barbaric# shooting of man in west Belfast condemnedNI universities get £m to handle Covid hardship fund for studentsTribute: wreaths laid to mark th anniversary of Belfast BlitzDon#t suffer in silence with negative thoughts, warns young NI footballer Stewart NixonQuestions over ex-police chief#s IRA murder claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working.

The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October . He added: “As the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance for businesses directly restricted by the Health Protection Regulations, I am unable to extend support to any close contact service for that period. “The criteria for the Localised Restrictions Support Schemeis directly linked to the Health Protection Regulations and there is no need to review the criteria.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he said. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack. Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign.

At present, food and garden waste are collected separately. However, under a new system, householders will be asked to combine food and garden in the larger garden waste bin for collection. This change was approved by councillors at a meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The new collection system has been run on a pilot basis in Strabane but is now to be extended to other areas across the council. Councillors were told at yesterdays meeting that the change will only be introduced where practical to do so and those properties without gardens – terraced housing, maisonettes etc – will continue to receive a weekly food waste collection using existing collection methods. googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: “If you have a big brown garden waste bin youll be permitted to put bagged food waste in it from now on. “Make sure that youve got the food in a compostable bag like you would have done when recycling food using your outdoor caddy. “Collections will be fortnightly on the same day as your existing garden waste collection.” The spokesperson added: “Well be letting everyone everyone affected know about this change in more detail over the next few weeks and will be providing handy tips on recycling at home.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning permission was this week granted for the conversion of the former Officers Mess building at Ebrington, known as Building , into offices. However, SDLP councillor John Boyle questioned whether offices were the best use for the fascinating building which was built in .

The works will provide new office accommodation incorporating meeting rooms and other associated facilities. Building  is a Grade  listed building, located along the southern side ofEbringtonSquare. Building  will undergo internal alterations with the addition of a lt shaft and a flat roof extension, transforming the building into a modern office space. Cllr Boyle told the meeting that he supported planning permission being granted for the respective plans for the two Ebrington buildings. However, in relation to Building , he said he believed the building could have been put to better use. googletag.cmd.push “Sometimes I do consider that buildings like this as office space, perhaps that is not the ideal use,” he said. “I actually know this building and some years ago a friend of mine was carrying out some remediation work inside it and I happened to call over and have a look around it. “It is a fascinating building, it really is a first class quality building and I just regret a little more imagination around what this building could have been used for has not been applied in this particular instance. “But office space can be useful and provides for employment opportunities and jobs and progression of local people and the economy here locally but we are where we are.     “I am also conscious of the fact that something can obviously then be reconverted back into something  as well.” Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson, chair of the councils Planning Committee, said he could understand Cllr Boyles comments in relation to a perceived lack of imagination. However, Cllr Jackson said many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he said the new office accommodation was a major step for the site. “We are starting to see businesses whatever their nature having the confidence to invest in Ebrington Square and relocating to Ebrington Square and inevitably it will lead to an increased footfall and along with that we hope to see the real ambition for Ebrington Square fulfilled.” In response, Cllr Boyle agreed that many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he welcomed the new plans for the Building  and Building . This weeks meeting was told that a local company, GLA Surveyors, had indicated that they plan to move into Building . A planning officer told this weeks meeting that he did not knowthere were prospective tenants for Building . Cllr Jackson said he was delighted to see work continue to progress at the site. This is just the latest step in the complete transformation of the site atEbringtonSquare and the journey towards achieving its potential as a hugely important business and cultural hub for the city. “The site is unique in bringing together both Derrys past and future stories. During the pandemic, people have really been making use of the space with its beautul panoramic views of the city and open walkways and recreational areas. “As the work continues and more businesses choose to locate to the site,Ebringtonwill become the vibrant, attractive and buzzing heart of the Waterside community. “I look forward to seeing this area continue to develop and improve over the coming months,” added the local councillor.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have seen athletes and athletics fans across Twitter tweeting and retweeting, and its been shared so much on Facebook. It has been an amazing journey.Spartan Bradley is seen as one of the most talented athletes to come from the city in recent years. He ran the  Barcelona Half-Marathon in a time of :, and who starred at the  Morton Games in Dublin, running a spectacular time of : in the m. He has been running competitively since he was  and has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years.Once Eamon, and fellow producer Paul Gormley decided to focus more locally, they were pointed in Conors direction, and the first seeds of It Runs Deep were planted.It all started back in Vienna when we went to see Eliud Kipchoge run, he explained. We wanted to make a documentary but when we were at that global stage we felt that we wanted to make something more at home and tell a local story. We felt that because it was the first documentary, it was the best place to start.Conors was a story that had to be told. That summer of  was really a showcase of the talent and the passion thats always been there. With that we unveiled the amazing success that Ireland had in Lisbon , so we really expand upon that. Ultimately its just a showcase of the talent that we have in our Track  Field here in Ireland, on the local level, on the national level and on the international level. googletag.cmd.push Released todayThe film makes its big premiere today on YouTube, and is sure to capture the imagination of those on the local running scene and beyond. However, having already received support and encouragement from across the board, Eamon and his team, who have poured everything into this documentary for two years, are confident that it will resonate beyond the world of athletics also.The overwhelming support that we have been given so far, not just locally, but around the country has been amazing, he added. It has been very collaborative and it has been beautul to capture a story within the world of athletics and were really looking forward to sharing it. Hopefully it resonates not just with athletics fans but hopefully sports fans and people who are interested in story telling in general, a story of patience and endurance, both on the creative side and on the athletics side. googletag.cmd.push For those wishing to view the documentary film, simply visit YouTube and search for It Runs Deep documentary.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

He has also sold two to the US market.Michael, who is a full-time wheelchair user, has designed Changing Places in order to give disabled people confidence and privacy when using the bathroom at outdoor spaces, pop-up events or festivals.He recently received a pound, grant award from UnLtd, the UKrsquos foundation for social entrepreneurs, to further develop his design.Michael, who is also chair of the Centre of Independent Living NI, said: ldquoThe awardrsquos funding and tailored business support will signicantly help us to widen the positive social impact for the disabled community across the island of Ireland.ldquoDuring lockdown over the past year, we have utilised the time in research and development to be able to extend the products and services we are able to offer.ldquoAs well as our mobile Changing Places for outdoor and pop-up events, we have been able to develop a modular Changing Places.ldquoThis will offer a cost effective permanent solution to breaking down the barriers that disabled people face when trying to access public toilets.

It is automatically washed down after every use to provide a hygienic convenience for its users.His designs have been discussed in the European Parliament and at a United Nations conference in Australia.Michael explained that central to his development of Changing Places was his experience of the barriers to living his le fully as someone living with a disability such as Motor Neurone Disease.ldquoUnless you are disabled or have a family member or friend who has a disability, the likelihood that you have even considered the barriers we face in daily living is nil, said Michael.ldquoI have consulted with people such as local campaigner Michaela Hollywood to find out exactly what people with complex medical and disability needs require from using a public convenience.ldquoA blind person even commented that to find a toilet where the floor was dry enough for her guide dog is rest on was nearly impossible.Michael, who has been living with his we, Jenner, and children, Georgia and Noah, in Darragh Cross since , stressed that AccessoLoo was about improving the everyday experience for disabled people while they were out and about and not about making a profit.He said: ldquoWhat is best about all of this, is that we are producing these items where quality is paramount, but the profit margin is not.

And an influential coronary care specialist based in Belfast has warned that closure of the Downersquos coronary care unit in favour of a thrombolysis initiative would signicantly reduce the quality of care available to the districtrsquos residents.The coronary care unit is seen as the cornerstone of the current hospital campaign to provide lesaving services in Downpatrick.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week.

Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

But it is most foolish. It reminds me of the little boy who recently lost his finger as a result of being allowed to stroke a lovely wee monkey in a zoo! If we forget the true nature of Sinn Fein IRA then we stand to lose more than a finger. What Mr Ekin suggests is like asking the captain of a ship in the midst of a sea battle to cease responding to the attacks of enemy vessels while he attends to the problems that the enemy attacks have created on his vessel Oftentimes ships are so damaged by enemy attacks that they must withdraw from the battle scene but as they do so they continue to mount what defence they can in response to the continued attacks of the enemy, for those assaults have not ended.I fear such sentiments indicate a total lack of understanding just what the enemies of Ulster’s constitutional existence are seeking to do.There is not a contest between two political ideologies taking place in Ulster. No, Sinn Fein IRA and its nationalist allies are seeking the destruction of Northern Ireland, not a change in the social policies which are in force within it.How foolish and blinded by a desire for political power were our unionist leaders when they entered into a ‘power-sharing’ coalition with those bent on the destruction of Northern Ireland.Let us never forget the true nature of what is taking place in our land.Rev Ivan Foster , Kilskeery, Co TyroneWe still support politicians whose main achievements are sectarianism and failure to progress——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I am grateful to Micheal O’Cathail for the courtesy of his reply to my earlier letter on this subject .The question of the whereabouts of Chaucer in the key years of - must remain a matter of intense speculation for us all. I make a few brief commentsImay be spared the indulgence of readers of the Belfast News Letter.. Chaucer’s we Philippa de Roet was the sister of Katherine Swynford, the mistress of John of Gaunt, the third surviving son of Edward III. Chaucer’s first original poem, The Book of the Duchessis an elegy on the death of Gaunt’s first we, Blanche of Lancaster. By this time Chaucer was in the household of the king himself. How long he remained in the household of the Countess of Ulster after  we simply do not know.. Chaucer may be regarded as the father of English poetry by Matthew Arnold, but English is a great literary language long before the Norman invasion of England in . The author of Beowulf , the first European epic poem in the vernacular, is the fatherof English Literature. Beowulf belongs to English culture in much the same way as The Book of Kells belongs to Irish culture. Indeed Langland was writing a great poem, Piers Plowman, possibly in Worcester of Gloucester, in the native English alliterative tradition of Beowulf in the years immediately before Chaucer.I cannot accept the view that the language of Beowulf and Piers Plowman, as also of Sir Gawain and the Green Knightwas ‘a somewhat rough language with few literary pretensions’.English nationhood is rooted in Aethelstan’s victory over the Scots and the irish from Dublin at Brunanburh in .Finally I do not see Chaucer’s poetry as rejecting in any way the Aristotelianism of Scholastic philosophers such as Aquinas.Gerald Morgan, Dublin Chaucer’s influence on the English people instilled a sense of deep pride an them——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Drakeford added: ldquoOn behalf of the Welsh Government and those supporting the government in this parliament, which was another huge development during his letime, I extend our sincerest sympathies at the end of an exceptional le lived.:Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said Philip had ldquooffered so much to so many people including through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the serving and former members of the Armed Forces.ldquoHis own military service saw him play a key role in the struggles of World War Two, and he never forgot the men and women he served with and the countless thousands who followed, Mr Davies said.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ldquoWe are here not only to grieve but also to thank Prince Philip for his letimersquos contribution.ldquoItrsquos not a title or status or crown that is Prince Philiprsquos most important legacy that we celebrate today but the support that he provided to others.The Duke of Edinburgh last visited the Senedd while accompanying the Queen to the opening of the fth session of the-then National Assembly for Wales in .Campaigning for the May  Senedd election was postponed over the weekend following Philiprsquos death, but was set to resume for all parties following Mondayrsquos recalled parliament plenary. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The demographics of the town and the cross community damage their decision will cause completely ignored.“Again the plan to steamroll forward with their original proposal, while ignoring the wishes of the community. Their plan to shut the Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High School, the only KS controlled non grammar school in the area to bus the children to Portadown starting September .“This decision takes place at the same time as we see two Catholic Maintained Schools within a mile radius being built from the ground up to the tune of £+ million while the Protestant children watch their school close and pushed from their town like second class citizens. This is an absolute disgrace. “The DUP has paid lip service to the campaign to keep our children in Lurgan. “A previous Sinn Fein Minister delivered for his community, the DUP is failing theirs. Currently there is a DUP minister in charge of Education who has the final say on this. “If this school shuts and these children are forced to move to another town to be educated it will be under a DUP watch. They will be totally and absolutely to blame and we will make sure it won’t be forgotten. No longer will they be able to point the finger at a Sinn Fein minister as their minister will be making the call on this.“The DUP inaction compared to their save the Dickson Plan campaign is in stark contrast. A failing educational system that needs a complete overhaul, a system of education that looks nothing like the original setup that was intended to serve all. It has been manipulated and changed over the years with self interest to serve the grammar schools first and foremost while everyone  suffers. A system the DUP fought tooth and nail to keep and which has now led to the situation we are in today and they are silent.“You the community also had your part to play but did you have the fight  That is a question you must ask yourself as another resource is ripped from the heart of a once proud community. You can still play your part though, you can demand your MP, MLAs and Councillors put pressure on the Education Minister to reject this proposal, tell them your vote relies on support for your community, that you will accept nothing less than major investment in your children and grandchildren’s future within your own town.“Once this school goes that’s it, it won’t be coming back and we stand over our claim that over time this will have a detrimental effect right across the protestant community in Lurgan.
