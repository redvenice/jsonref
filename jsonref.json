Nilsen (pictured) wife of Man Utd\u0027s Victor Lindelof are staying at the Renaissance with the England teamEngland\u0027s players will be staying in the same hotel as the Swedish WAGs ahead of tomorrow\u0027s World Cup quarter final, MailOnline can reveal.Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying.But the Swedes are bragging they already have the edge after they were booked into Samara\u0027s only five-star resort - leaving England in a more modest four-star hotel. Sweden\u0027s FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027  His countrymen are in the Lotte Hotel, which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area.   The hotel\u0027s sumptuous  fine food menu lists the amount of calories contained in each item for weight watchers - which even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16.Their players can also tuck into tuna with chukka seaweed salad, crab cake with tomato salsa, roast duck, creme of pumpkin soup with Kamchatka crab and cream cheese and tiger shrimp and scallop brochettes and a filet Mignion steak.          Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance (pictured) in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying          England has been allocated the four-star Renaissance (foyer pictured) Hotel in Samara while their World Cup quarter final opponents are staying at the town\u0027s only five star resort           Sweden are crowing to have been allocated better accommodation than their rivals. Their FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson (left) joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027Rebekah Vardy reveals the England sex ban has been lifted...Share this articleThe country\u0027s FA general secretary Hakan Sjostrand chuckled: \u0027Yes we also have caviar on the menu, but that will be OK as long as England have their fish and chips.\u0027 Meanwhile Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be staying on the outskirts next door to an Ibis hotel with a McDonalds nearby and traffic streaming outside and fridge magnets are on sale in the foyer for  £1.50. The Renaissance offers a range of salads, soups, grilled meat and fish in its \u0027Terrace\u0027 restaurant with its most pricey item being a grilled steak for £22.           England boss Gareth Southgate had no say in the hotel, which was chosen by FIFAHowever, England\u0027s players rarely eat in hotel restaurants and have their own food prepared for them by an official FA chef.The 196-room Renaissance was opened in 2003 with rates starting at £70 a night compared to the more expensive Lotte where the cheapest rooms are £200. But the standard of cotton sheets and the fine food will be forgotten once the teams do battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals.Mr Nilsson, who was wearing his country\u0027s football short and is a Wolverhampton Wanderers fan, said: \u0027 FIFA chose this hotel. So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.          The Swedes are in the Lotte Hotel (pictured), which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area where the cheapest rooms available at the moment are £200 per night          The Lotte\u0027s sumptuous fine food on offer even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16\u0027And we won the group of four here which had Germany in it and we have just beaten Switzerland in Russia who are ranked sixth in the world…why shouldn\u0027t we be confident?\u0027We also have the biggest respect for our opponents. But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory. But overall, a fair match which will be great for the supporters and enjoyed by the world.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/10/4DF8318B00000578-5924913-image-a-22_1530869652502.jpg","title":"How Jesse Lingard Englands King Social Media","story":"    This tweet by Jesse Lingard this week assured his place as the king of social media in the England team, whose image has been transformed by players\u0027 use of Instagram and Twitter          He is now turning his footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single after his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse before tweeting: \u0027At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\u0027          Lingard and Ms Frumes split up in March after she posed for steamy pictures in his shirtSocial media experts say his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there are rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.

I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/22/4DFC974400000578-0-image-m-34_1530913063689.jpg","title":"Boycott boycott Rio Ferdinand enjoys cup tea slice cake Vladimir Putin","story":"    Former England internationals Alex Scott, second left, and Rio Ferdinand, right, were pictured with Vladimir Putin centre, despite a boycott of the tournament by British politicians and members of the Royal Family over the ongoing dispute with RussiaAnd Ferdinand was sitting just two spaces away from Putin as they chatted around a grand, white table.

Useful in politics, that is. He read law at university and became a solicitor. He had a good brain but there was also a hankering for wider acclaim. Humdrum legal work, attending to conveyancing or wills or marital disputes, will not grab headlines the way a big yellow balloon can. Human rights was where the political juice was. The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government! Mr Khan almost bit their hands off and became a Whip (ie an enforcer among Labour MPs). Soon he was badgering other MPs to vote for detention periods of 42 days without charge. How easily had those once precious principles been blunted.\u0027The biggest insult to a sitting US president ever\u0027: Nigel...Meet the men behind the anti-Trump protests: The wealthy...Share this articleSince then this oddly insubstantial figure has floated upwards – and away from his working-class roots – on a series of felicitous thermals. Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint. How were homeowners meant to struggle home with the weekly supermarket shopping?          An inflatable balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby wearing a nappy, which will fly over London when the President visits on July 13, with one of its creators Leo MurrayMr Khan’s eco-lecturing did not stop him making a much-trumpeted vanity trip to Pakistan and India where one of his great photo-opportunities coincided with a terrible smog in Delhi and he was almost completely invisible posing for photographs in the pea-souper. The trip was depicted as a ‘coming home’ for him, yet when he was asked about that, he said, ‘I’m from London, mate’. Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt. One can but hope.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/00/4DF7DA2400000578-0-image-a-16_1530920636540.jpg","title":"Alan Titchmarsh says water companies stop blaming gardeners","story":"    Aerial images highlight the effect the heatwave is having on Britain\u0027s green and pleasant land as the parched earth turns an arid yellow amid scorching temperatures and little rainfall    With the heatwave set to last, suppliers are warning their customers to use less water or face a banBut Titchmarsh, 69, hit out at the warnings, saying that water firms waste so much in leaks themselves.Three billion litres of water simply drains away every day, according to regulator Ofwat. Titchmarsh told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘A hosepipe ban would be galling when so much water is not properly managed and leaks.

Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

But the bar insists it never offered the large function room that Katrina and Samuel, 31, say they requested.          They believe the decision not to give them the room they wanted is due to the England gameA spokesman said: \u0027It was unfortunate that on this occasion, communication between ourselves and the party involved was delayed and details were not finalised until just over a week before the event. We would like to make it clear that this was not a failure on our part.\u0027Due to this delay, the apparent mix-up over the function room offered only came to light very late in the day.\u0027We have done our utmost to find an alternative solution and it is a shame that we have not been able to do so.\u0027England\u0027s quarter final tie, which kicks off at 3pm, has caused headaches for scores of couples planning their big days.            Humber Dock Bar and Grill in Hull insists the dispute is the result of an administrative mix-upOne couple, from Norwich, have arranged for the game to be screened at their wedding.Hayley Cullum, 31, and her fiancée, James Adams, 33, will wed at 2pm today - and have their photos taken at the same time as kick off.  \u0027I\u0027m not bothered by it but all of the men on both sides love football, especially Adam\u0027s mates who cry over it, so I thought instead of losing half of my wedding party I would put a TV up\u0027 she told the Eastern Daily Press. Ahead of the game, one senior Church of England cleric has warned people not to watch the game on mobile phones or tablets if they are in church.One couple have installed a satellite dish so their guests can watch the quarter-final - but they will have to wait until after the speeches and watch the game \u0027as live\u0027 two hours later. Elsewhere gig-goers at the British Summer Time in Hyde Park didn\u0027t arrive until at least 5pm - three hours after it starts - because \u0027unpatriotic\u0027 organisers aren\u0027t showing the football and won\u0027t allow people to come and go from the site.And organisers of London\u0027s Pride festival are considering putting up giant screens so the tens of thousands taking part on Saturday afternoon can cheer England on rather than stay away.            Matt Yeo and fiancee Sophie Wood (pictured) are installing satellite dishes at their wedding reception but guests will have to wait until 5pm and watch the match \u0027as live\u0027 Graphic designer Matt Yeo told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027It has changed our plans quite dramatically. My fiancee Sophie is not a football fan and is very against the idea of having any football because you don\u0027t want to detract from the big day. \u0027But I felt that everyone will be looking at their phones or feeling like they wish they were watching it.\u0027Matt and fiancee Sophie Wood, both 30, will instead set up a television for their guests to watch the match at 5pm, instead of having the speeches ruined by the distraction of the World Cup. Guests will be told to turn their phones off so they can watch the game later without knowing the result. Meanwhile groom-to-be Carl Gould, who finds himself in a similar position, told the Guardian he would not install screens as \u0027we\u0027re not getting married in a Wetherspoons\u0027.    He said he hoped the wedding day would bring the England team luck, saying: \u0027If we could have a wedding win, and an England win – that would be ideal.\u0027 Bride-to-be Jodie Houlston, from Lincolnshire, said: \u0027OK England, you\u0027re starting to worry me now.\u0027If you\u0027re kicking a ball around a bit of grass upstages me on my wedding day I may have to have the first a strop of my life.\u0027        Wedding plans have been thrown into chaos because of the big game at 3pm on SaturdayDanni Jordan, of Ipswich, said her brother had posted a Facebook status asking his fiancée if they could move their wedding to Sunday, so he doesn\u0027t miss the match.   Ashleigh Marie said: \u0027When the England game will be playing during your wedding... woo, nothing like paying all that money to have missing guests.\u0027  Groom-to-be Gary Snoad tweeted: \u0027My own wedding clashing with the big game on Saturday - what have I done? Apologies to the English contingent, definitely the Welsh family side that picked the date.\u0027 And Zoey Olivia, of Watford, added: \u0027Just realised I\u0027m at a wedding on Saturday and England are playing... I\u0027m so torn. I hope there\u0027s a TV.\u0027Sandra Millar, the Church of England\u0027s head of \u0027life events\u0027, said: \u0027For those attending a wedding service at 3pm, I\u0027d strongly encourage you to make sure you are fully on-side with the happy couple and switch off your mobile phone in advance.\u0027Rev Millar added that while guests \u0027may be forgiven\u0027 for checking the score at the reception - doing this in church should be given the \u0027red card\u0027.She told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027For those getting married on Saturday, like England fans you might experience a few nerves - but you can be sure that it will also be the best day of your life, with memories to cherish. \u0027Who knows, come 6pm, that may be something you share with the rest of the nation too\u0027.  Though she is English, bride-to-be Carmel, 27, from the Midlands, says there would not be any options for fans to watch the game at her wedding to Killian, 30, in South Wales on Saturday.\u0027We don\u0027t have the facilities to do so in the venue, so that\u0027s a good excuse.\u0027No-one has directly asked for us to put it on but there have been several jokes and suggestions, if you know what I mean. People who would like to have it on but don\u0027t want to straight out ask or come across as rude or anything.\u0027Asked how she would react if anyone sneaked off to catch a glimpse of the television, Carmel said: \u0027I\u0027d probably be like, \u0027Are you serious?!\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t mind people checking the scores or having a quick look on their phones while we\u0027re all milling about but if anyone goes off to the accommodation I won\u0027t be best pleased!\u0027It\u0027s at 3 so it sits quite nicely between our ceremony and dinner. As long as they\u0027re around and engaging, I\u0027m happy to have a little give and take,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think all our friends and family are pretty respectful so I don\u0027t think they\u0027d push it really.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s been some heated debates\u0027George Morey, 25, and the soon-to-be Aimee Morey, 24, have managed to secure a screen for their wedding reception at a golf club in Swanley, Kent, and say \u0027dinner will be pushed\u0027.\u0027There\u0027s certainly been some heated debates about the game but she\u0027s come round to the idea of it now,\u0027 said George, a Millwall fan who works as a trainee lift engineer.\u0027If we win it will just add to the atmosphere of the day. We can\u0027t wait.\u0027I\u0027ve had this in my head that England will play this day since the draw in December.\u0027He added: \u0027I was thinking it would be the Germans in the quarter-final but I\u0027ll take Sweden and a first semi-final in 28 years instead.\u0027Couple who began romance aged 13 allow wedding guests to watch England match during vows | Great Yarmouth News - Great Yarmouth MercuryNorwich couple to screen World Cup game at wedding | Latest Norfolk and Suffolk News - Eastern Daily Press"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/16/4E02C7A000000578-5928633-image-a-93_1530976889642.jpg","title":"World Cup England Sweden players stride pitch Samara ahead World Cup Sweden clash","story":"    Dele Alli rises above the Swedish defence to score England\u0027s second header against Sweden in the quarter final clash          Go on, Dele!

Food spending on the match will add up to another £30m in pubs and £40m at home.  However, not all of the UK was getting behind the Three Lions.Swedes and Scots packed into Akva, a Swedish bar in Edinburgh\u0027s west end, to watch the match.There was Swedish bunting and flags, with many fans wearing the side\u0027s yellow strip.A faulty connection added to the tension outside in the beer garden, where supporters groaned as the large screen showing the game repeatedly cut off.            Fans hold up \u0027It\u0027s Coming Home\u0027 signs and wear Three Lions shirts at Nass Festival in Bath          England fans get ready for the game ahead of the England Match at the Nass Festival in Bath          There was a massive queue outside of The Original Oak in Headingley, Leeds, this morning.

Then I saw the police jump out and run to the building.‘They split up: some went to the upper road and some took the lower road and some went by the lake. It was getting dark. We were sitting there thinking “Should we be afraid?” — because one of the policemen took his gun out.’Then, leaping from the first-floor balcony, the man attempted to flee, jumping down to the lawn below.Luckily, officers who had been staking out the flat for days were ready and waiting — wrestling him to the ground and securing him with handcuffs.He has been under lock and key ever since. And, if the authorities have their way, he will remain so for some considerable time.Because the smooth-talking ‘business executive’ is none other than Mark Acklom, Britain’s most wanted conman.He’s been on the run for more than four years, having allegedly fleeced orcee Carolyn Woods out of her £850,000 life savings while posing as a wealthy banker and MI6 agent, and is suspected of cheating dozens more by claiming to be a property developer, City broker, lawyer and even a gynaecologist.Cancer-stricken England fan, 63, will be held in Russia for...Tragic Alesha, six, was \u0027raped and murdered before her body...Share this articleHis arrest brings to an end a Europe-wide manhunt for the privately-educated swindler. Acklom, known for his love of fast cars, first-class travel and expensive hotels, is alleged to have used dozens of false identities to stay one step ahead of the authorities.At the weekend, his luck finally ran out after an international operation involving the National Crime Agency, Avon and Somerset Police and the Swiss authorities.Proceedings to extradite him to the UK are now underway and he is expected to face at least 20 charges of fraud and other offences.For his alleged victims, the news, while welcome, is bittersweet. Because it is almost impossible to overestimate the devastation they say Acklom has left in his wake.‘It has been a very long haul and my health has suffered,’ 61-year-old Miss Woods, who lives in Bath, told the Mail this week. ‘It seems every time I try to start afresh, something else happens with him and it brings the whole episode rushing back.’Meanwhile, IT specialist Christopher Frampton, 55, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, claims his health and marriage collapsed under the strain of being fleeced out of £50,000 when, he says, the conman persuaded him to give up his lucrative corporate job for a business venture that turned out to be a scam.‘It devastated my life so much, I’m having therapy,’ he says. ‘I am cross that Acklom was living in a million-pound property in Switzerland — I lost all the money I’d saved and my family went from living comfortably to living hand-to-mouth.’          Mark Acklom (pictured) with his wife Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez at Ascot\u0027s Royal EnclosureEven Acklom’s own family, from whom he has been estranged for years, still bear the scars from his behaviour.His mother, Diana, told us: ‘My marriage broke up over this, and his children by his first wife don’t have anything to do with him.‘If he wanted to really run away, he should have gone to South America, like Ronnie Biggs. But I think he liked to live on the edge — he needed to have a buzz.‘I was speaking to his brother and he said: “How can he live not knowing who would be behind the next knock on the door?’’’And, make no mistake, in recent months the net had been steadily tightening around him.The current manhunt was launched in October 2016 when a European arrest warrant was issued by Avon and Somerset Police, originally focusing on allegations of fraud linked to Ms Woods.She claims that in 2012, Acklom had walked into the boutique where she worked in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and swept her off her feet, saying he was Mark Conway, a Swiss banker.By the end of their year-long ‘romance’, Miss Woods says she had lent him every penny of her £850,000 life savings.The mother-of-two claims that she was financially ruined and on the brink of suicide when Acklom left her.When the warrant was sought, British police believed Acklom was hiding in Spain: he had a Spanish wife, Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, whom he married in 2009 and with whom he had two children.But in May 2017, the hunt switched to Switzerland after he was photographed at a Geneva cafe by one of his alleged victims, who spotted him by chance.When police examined the images, they realised he was drinking coffee with a Spanish fraudster, also then on the run.The café was staked out — but Acklom never returned.Then, earlier this year, he was linked to a flat in a northern suburb of Zurich, from which it was believed he had been setting up various companies in a bid to attract investors.One business claimed to be manufacturing computer chips for black-box data recorders for cars. The company’s website suggested it had customers from the luxury car industry.Its motto is: ‘Being Defeated Is Optional.’At one point, undercover police mounted a surveillance operation on a bank following a tip-off that Acklom was planning to meet staff and business associates there, but he did not show up.At the time, Sky News revealed that Acklom still had a current passport and a Swiss residency permit in the name of Marc Long — one of several aliases he has used. The legitimate documents were obtained in 2014, shortly after Acklom fled Britain and after he had changed his name by deed poll.          As a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadfulWhat we have now established is that for the past year he has been living in a stunning first-floor apartment overlooking Lake Zurich and has continued to have access to considerable sums of money.The apartment he was renting in the town of Wädenswil, 25 miles south of Zurich, would have cost him up to £2,500 a month. The children were being educated at a local private school.‘My first impression of him was that he was someone who didn’t really want to talk to people,’ said one neighbour. ‘I saw the wife and kids on the paddle board but they’d never say hello.’And Acklom himself was seemingly concerned about being recognised. He generally spoke Spanish, had grown shoulder-length hair and a bushy beard and would always wear sunglasses and a baseball cap. He looked very different, say neighbours, from his police ‘Wanted’ picture.His 47-year-old wife, meanwhile, had continued to indulge her life-long love of yoga.Since last August, she had been paying for one-to-one yoga classes, booking five sessions in advance each time. In the holidays, her ‘very sweet’ children accompanied her to the classes.She used the name Maria Longi and paid in cash — the only one of the instructor’s clients to do so.The instructor, who asked not to be named, said Maria claimed her husband managed a project concerning electronic ‘black boxes’ for cars and was ‘in the IT business’. Out of curiosity, she had searched the internet for more information, but found nothing.Although his wife is not believed to be wanted for any crime, sources close to the case have speculated whether the very existence of a wife and children — three extra people for the authorities to try to trace — may ultimately have hastened his downfall.Last autumn, police had specifically appealed for information about his wife and daughters. They said they believed the children would be attending private schools and that his wife was likely to indulge her passion for yoga.They were right on both counts.‘We have an incredibly high success rate in tracking down fugitives from British justice,’ said Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the National Crime Agency, in the wake of the arrest.‘We do that through a host of techniques, including mobilising the ability of the public to assist us, which is why we publish the identities of these iniduals.’While celebrating the good news, those who know Acklom say they will not be happy until he is back in Britain to face justice.  Proceedings to extradite him  are now underway and he may face at least 20 charges of fraudRaised in Bromley, Kent, Mark Acklom was the eldest of four children born to a City insurance consultant. He was educated at the prestigious Dulwich Preparatory school. He then went on to board at Eastbourne College, an independent boarding and day school in East Sussex.Despite having all the advantages money could buy, from the beginning, he was a troublesome child. His mother, Diana, believes that a difficult birth may have left him with a brain injury that meant he struggled to empathise with others.‘When he was two, I bought our first puppy,’ she recalled. ‘I had just brought her home and she was sitting on the stairs. He went up and just kicked her out the way. That was the first time I thought this was odd. Most children would go up to a puppy and cuddle it.’In a bid to embrace his difference, when her son was seven, Diana placed a sign on his bedroom door reading: ‘Why be normal?’But as a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadful.As an adult, Acklom made plans to become a Catholic priest then just as quickly dropped them.Next, he married a girl he met in a nightclub. His daughter and son were born shortly afterwards. But the relationship didn’t last, and Acklom walked out on his family when the children were young and never saw them again.Soon afterwards he headed to Spain, but later returned to Britain and became the director of a series of short-lived companies.In 2012, he allegedly met Miss Woods, as well as others, including Mr Frampton, and reportedly once even claimed to be a ‘close business associate’ of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone.While many who met him say they suffered, Acklom and his family continued to live the high-life. Following the events of last weekend, that, however, looks set to change.Two days after his arrest, his wife, who yesterday was still in the lakeside apartment with her children, turned up as usual for her yoga session, telling the instructor that it would have to be her last.‘I don’t have the money to pay for them any more,’ she said.Quite whether she had any idea of her husband’s alleged deceptions remains to be seen. For now at least, it seems, she will no longer be enjoying the fruits of his labours.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/13/4DF96C0600000578-0-image-a-82_1530881696121.jpg","title":"What wives 1966 think todays World Cup WAGs","story":"    From left: Alan Ball\u0027s girlfriend Lesley Newton Geoff Hurst\u0027s wife Judith Nobby Stiles\u0027s wife Kay Bobby Charlton\u0027s wife Norma Ray Wilson\u0027s wife Pat Terry Paine\u0027s wife Carol and Gordon Banks\u0027s wife Ursula on the eve of the 1966 World Cup final  How times have changed.Mrs Vardy has spoken openly about today’s players’ sex lives.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.          WAGs on a night out in St Petersburg. From left: Millie Savage, Gemma Acton, Megan Davison, Becky Vardy, Annabel Peyton, Fern Hawkins, Shannon Horlock, Annie Kilner and Lucia LoiLike current England captain Harry Kane’s fiancee, Katie Goodland, Pat was pregnant and opted to stay at home for medical reasons. ‘I watched it at home because I was about to have a baby. I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/11/4DF3845F00000578-0-image-a-84_1530874646844.jpg","title":"A shallow gassy opportunist QUENTIN LETTS Sadiq Khan","story":"    London Mayor Sadiq Khan (pictured) and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a long-running war of words over issues such as crime and terrorismHe attended a boxing gym to improve his weedy physique and to learn how to dodge punches. Useful in politics, that is. He read law at university and became a solicitor. He had a good brain but there was also a hankering for wider acclaim. Humdrum legal work, attending to conveyancing or wills or marital disputes, will not grab headlines the way a big yellow balloon can. Human rights was where the political juice was. The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government! Mr Khan almost bit their hands off and became a Whip (ie an enforcer among Labour MPs). Soon he was badgering other MPs to vote for detention periods of 42 days without charge. How easily had those once precious principles been blunted.\u0027The biggest insult to a sitting US president ever\u0027: Nigel...Meet the men behind the anti-Trump protests: The wealthy...Share this articleSince then this oddly insubstantial figure has floated upwards – and away from his working-class roots – on a series of felicitous thermals. Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint. How were homeowners meant to struggle home with the weekly supermarket shopping?          An inflatable balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby wearing a nappy, which will fly over London when the President visits on July 13, with one of its creators Leo MurrayMr Khan’s eco-lecturing did not stop him making a much-trumpeted vanity trip to Pakistan and India where one of his great photo-opportunities coincided with a terrible smog in Delhi and he was almost completely invisible posing for photographs in the pea-souper. The trip was depicted as a ‘coming home’ for him, yet when he was asked about that, he said, ‘I’m from London, mate’. Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt.

Sanctuary founder Steph Taylor said: ‘It doesn’t seem to affect them at all, they are scratching up scratch posts. They even manage to jump down from levels as well. They are doing really well.’Frog and Newt will be kept in long-term care to assess their progress. Because they are thriving, there are no plans to fit them with wheels, which can happen with animals that lose their legs.The sanctuary looks after some 500 animals a year, with each cat or kitten rescued costing it around £60.

They believe the decision not to give them the room they wanted is due to the England gameA spokesman said: \u0027It was unfortunate that on this occasion, communication between ourselves and the party involved was delayed and details were not finalised until just over a week before the event. We would like to make it clear that this was not a failure on our part.\u0027Due to this delay, the apparent mix-up over the function room offered only came to light very late in the day.\u0027We have done our utmost to find an alternative solution and it is a shame that we have not been able to do so.\u0027England\u0027s quarter final tie, which kicks off at 3pm, has caused headaches for scores of couples planning their big days.            Humber Dock Bar and Grill in Hull insists the dispute is the result of an administrative mix-upOne couple, from Norwich, have arranged for the game to be screened at their wedding.Hayley Cullum, 31, and her fiancée, James Adams, 33, will wed at 2pm today - and have their photos taken at the same time as kick off.  \u0027I\u0027m not bothered by it but all of the men on both sides love football, especially Adam\u0027s mates who cry over it, so I thought instead of losing half of my wedding party I would put a TV up\u0027 she told the Eastern Daily Press. Ahead of the game, one senior Church of England cleric has warned people not to watch the game on mobile phones or tablets if they are in church.One couple have installed a satellite dish so their guests can watch the quarter-final - but they will have to wait until after the speeches and watch the game \u0027as live\u0027 two hours later. Elsewhere gig-goers at the British Summer Time in Hyde Park didn\u0027t arrive until at least 5pm - three hours after it starts - because \u0027unpatriotic\u0027 organisers aren\u0027t showing the football and won\u0027t allow people to come and go from the site.And organisers of London\u0027s Pride festival are considering putting up giant screens so the tens of thousands taking part on Saturday afternoon can cheer England on rather than stay away.            Matt Yeo and fiancee Sophie Wood (pictured) are installing satellite dishes at their wedding reception but guests will have to wait until 5pm and watch the match \u0027as live\u0027 Graphic designer Matt Yeo told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027It has changed our plans quite dramatically. My fiancee Sophie is not a football fan and is very against the idea of having any football because you don\u0027t want to detract from the big day. \u0027But I felt that everyone will be looking at their phones or feeling like they wish they were watching it.\u0027Matt and fiancee Sophie Wood, both 30, will instead set up a television for their guests to watch the match at 5pm, instead of having the speeches ruined by the distraction of the World Cup. Guests will be told to turn their phones off so they can watch the game later without knowing the result. Meanwhile groom-to-be Carl Gould, who finds himself in a similar position, told the Guardian he would not install screens as \u0027we\u0027re not getting married in a Wetherspoons\u0027.    He said he hoped the wedding day would bring the England team luck, saying: \u0027If we could have a wedding win, and an England win – that would be ideal.\u0027 Bride-to-be Jodie Houlston, from Lincolnshire, said: \u0027OK England, you\u0027re starting to worry me now.\u0027If you\u0027re kicking a ball around a bit of grass upstages me on my wedding day I may have to have the first a strop of my life.\u0027        Wedding plans have been thrown into chaos because of the big game at 3pm on SaturdayDanni Jordan, of Ipswich, said her brother had posted a Facebook status asking his fiancée if they could move their wedding to Sunday, so he doesn\u0027t miss the match.   Ashleigh Marie said: \u0027When the England game will be playing during your wedding... woo, nothing like paying all that money to have missing guests.\u0027  Groom-to-be Gary Snoad tweeted: \u0027My own wedding clashing with the big game on Saturday - what have I done? Apologies to the English contingent, definitely the Welsh family side that picked the date.\u0027 And Zoey Olivia, of Watford, added: \u0027Just realised I\u0027m at a wedding on Saturday and England are playing... I\u0027m so torn. I hope there\u0027s a TV.\u0027Sandra Millar, the Church of England\u0027s head of \u0027life events\u0027, said: \u0027For those attending a wedding service at 3pm, I\u0027d strongly encourage you to make sure you are fully on-side with the happy couple and switch off your mobile phone in advance.\u0027Rev Millar added that while guests \u0027may be forgiven\u0027 for checking the score at the reception - doing this in church should be given the \u0027red card\u0027.She told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027For those getting married on Saturday, like England fans you might experience a few nerves - but you can be sure that it will also be the best day of your life, with memories to cherish. \u0027Who knows, come 6pm, that may be something you share with the rest of the nation too\u0027.  Though she is English, bride-to-be Carmel, 27, from the Midlands, says there would not be any options for fans to watch the game at her wedding to Killian, 30, in South Wales on Saturday.\u0027We don\u0027t have the facilities to do so in the venue, so that\u0027s a good excuse.\u0027No-one has directly asked for us to put it on but there have been several jokes and suggestions, if you know what I mean. People who would like to have it on but don\u0027t want to straight out ask or come across as rude or anything.\u0027Asked how she would react if anyone sneaked off to catch a glimpse of the television, Carmel said: \u0027I\u0027d probably be like, \u0027Are you serious?!\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t mind people checking the scores or having a quick look on their phones while we\u0027re all milling about but if anyone goes off to the accommodation I won\u0027t be best pleased!\u0027It\u0027s at 3 so it sits quite nicely between our ceremony and dinner. As long as they\u0027re around and engaging, I\u0027m happy to have a little give and take,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think all our friends and family are pretty respectful so I don\u0027t think they\u0027d push it really.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s been some heated debates\u0027George Morey, 25, and the soon-to-be Aimee Morey, 24, have managed to secure a screen for their wedding reception at a golf club in Swanley, Kent, and say \u0027dinner will be pushed\u0027.\u0027There\u0027s certainly been some heated debates about the game but she\u0027s come round to the idea of it now,\u0027 said George, a Millwall fan who works as a trainee lift engineer.\u0027If we win it will just add to the atmosphere of the day. We can\u0027t wait.\u0027I\u0027ve had this in my head that England will play this day since the draw in December.\u0027He added: \u0027I was thinking it would be the Germans in the quarter-final but I\u0027ll take Sweden and a first semi-final in 28 years instead.\u0027Couple who began romance aged 13 allow wedding guests to watch England match during vows | Great Yarmouth News - Great Yarmouth MercuryNorwich couple to screen World Cup game at wedding | Latest Norfolk and Suffolk News - Eastern Daily Press"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/15/4E01DA9B00000578-5928441-Video_footage_reveals_a_seal_who_sat_in_the_centre_of_a_home_s_f-a-22_1530973508678.jpg","title":"Seal chases woman street","story":"This is the hilarious moment a seal was spotted defending his owner\u0027s turf in the middle of an unsuspecting Australian suburb (pictured)  Video footage reveals a seal who sat in the centre of a home\u0027s front yard in Beachport, South Australia engaging in a stare-off with a female passerbySeal pups play tug of war with a sheet of plastic washed up...Give us a lift, mate!

It felt true to life.Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A (Bodley Head) by Danielle Allen, a memoir about the loss of a beloved cousin, is unbearably moving. It illuminates the injustice often meted out to young black men by the American criminal justice system.Uzodinma Iweala’s Speak No Evil (John Murray), in which a young Nigerian American comes out as gay, is a coming of age story about the difficult, churning mix of family expectations. It is elegant and elegiac, and evokes Washington DC with subtle power.The Years by Annie Ernaux (Fitzcarraldo) is a remarkable work, a truly innovative autobiography that opens new ways of remembering and recuperating the past. The Long Take, by Robin Robertson (Picador), is a narrative in verse set in the immediate post-war years in America, that is at once heartbreaking and bracing. Think of it as the best black and white 1940s movie you will ever encounter in print.The Order of Time, by Carlo Rovelli (Allen Lane), hardly seems like pool-side reading, but anyone with the least interest in the science of the physical world will be by turns astonished, baffled and thrilled by what Rovelli has to say about the true nature of time, which has little in common with our everyday conception of it. Rovelli is the poet of quantum physics.Seamus Heaney 100 Poems (Faber) is an essential collection, which the poet meant to make before he died, and which the Heaney family have now completed. A feast of beauty.I’ve greatly enjoyed two group biographies: Agnès Poirier’s rich and funny Left Bank (Bloomsbury), about cold rooms and hot ideas in postwar Paris and Martin Gayford’s wise and generous Modernists and Mavericks (Thames \u0026amp Hudson), about artists in London from 1945 to 1970. And what to read in homage to Philip Roth? Maybe American Pastoral.Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine (Granta), a very lively book about transhumanism, won the Wellcome prize. Sally Rooney is 27 and so won’t be worrying about mortality – she entered the landscape fully fledged in the now traditional Irish manner, and with great power, – like Katherine Mansfield and Elizabeth Bowen fused together – with Conversations with Friends (Faber). Just in case it gets lost in the newer dazzle, it’s worth mentioning again Red Dirt (Head of Zeus, 2015) by EM Reapy, which won the Rooney prize, an Irish stormer set in Australia.I’m lucky enough to be reading Only to Sleep by Lawrence Osborne (out from Hogarth in September). A brilliant Raymond Chandler continuation novel with an ageing Philip Marlowe. Osborne and Chandler are a perfect match. Luke Kennard’s wit and astonishing virtuosity, so present in his poetry, have safely made the journey to his beguiling first novel The Transition (4th Estate): very funny, gimlet-eyed observation. Talking of poetry, Michael O’Neill’s latest collection Return of the Gift (Arc) is wise, lucid and pitch perfect.I just read Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire (Bloomsbury). It’s brilliant in itself, but it also made me rethink Sophocles’s Antigone, on which it is loosely based. For some high-fibre holiday reading, I shall be packing Josephine Quinn’s In Search of the Phoenicians (Princeton), which dares to ask whether that famous ancient people really existed, and promises to expose the modern fantasies and ideologies that created them.Broad Band (Portfolio) is a brilliantly written and necessary history of our foremost cultural technology by Claire Evans. It illuminates the occluded contributions of many women to the medium over more than 150 years, and transforms our understanding in doing so. From mathematicians to community managers, engineers to speleologists, Evans shows how the internet’s past, present and future are all utterly contingent upon its radical ersity.Daniel Trilling has spent years tracing the routes taken by migrants from across Africa and the Middle East to Europe, meeting people and keeping in touch with them along the way: in camps, in cafes, and on Facebook. In Lights in the Distance (Picador) he tells their stories – or, more often, allows them to tell their own – calmly, clearly and deeply affectingly, never losing sight of the violence, brutality and pervasive racism that underlies and maintains the present situation.Let Me Be Like Water by SK Perry (Melville House) is a wonderful debut novel about how we find our feet again after a bereavement. It’s one of the best evocations of the grieving process I’ve read and is written in a fluid engaging style that draws you in to the protagonist Holly’s world.There is not a word wasted in Fondue, the second collection of poems by AK Blakemore (Offord Road). I was struck by Blakemore’s gift for crafting memorable and devastating images that stay in the mind long after you’ve closed the book.I saw Michael Donkor read at Brixton library recently and was enthralled by the extract he shared from his debut novel Hold (4th Estate), which moves between London and Ghana. I am looking forward to reading it in full.Far and away the funniest (and saddest) new book I’ve read this year is The Collected Letters of Flann O’Brien (Dalkey Archive), although I’m slightly reluctant to suggest that anybody packs this 600-page doorstop in their beach bag. Otherwise, having just finished writing a novel myself, I’m eager to e back into other people’s fictional worlds, and am looking forward, equally, to Whistle in the Dark (Viking) by Emma Healey – which I’m told is even better than the excellent Elizabeth Is Missing – Old Baggage (Doubleday) by Lissa Evans (a novel of the suffragette movement that promises to be both warm and funny) and, for a bit of cold-eyed post-Brexit satire, Perfidious Albion (Faber) by Sam Byers.I am really enjoying Catherine Lacey’s short stories Certain American States (Granta) so will read her first novel Nobody Is Ever Missing to catch up. She is playful and smart, one of a generation of American women who seem entirely unafraid. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room (Jonathan Cape) shows what happens when a smart writer gets truly serious. It is a necessary and compelling book, and this year’s must read. I will also bring proofs of Robert Alter’s translation of the Bible (out from Norton in December), the first single author translation ever to be published, and Human Relations and Other Difficulties (Profile), a collection of essays by Mary-Kay Wilmers, whose intelligence I find endlessly opaque and interesting.This is a brilliant summer for books by women: novels, memoirs and poems that address the difficult questions in women’s lives from an intimate perspective, but also with an unsentimental, distancing acuity and a preparedness to invent new forms for writing and for living. Three that seem to speak to each other in this respect are Deborah Levy’s game-changing The Cost of Living (Hamish Hamilton), Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) and Sheila Heti’s Motherhood (Harvill Secker). I also love Kathyrn Maris’s new poetry collection The House With Only an Attic and a Basement (Penguin), which tackles motherhood and family life with a comic thoughtfulness that’s unusually open to cruelty and that can rise and fall easily between the heroic and the bathetic. And right now, the book that’s really gripping me, and making me start again in thinking about many things, is Silver Press’s reprint of Nell Dunn’s 1965 Talking to Women, a series of artfully transcribed conversations with 10 of her friends. What’s striking, reading this, is how much has changed but also how little. And, unusually, the lack of change doesn’t feel depressing, reading these interviews, because there’s a pleasure in feeling so connected to these women across the decades. Also, there’s a kind of satisfaction in feeling that it’s just as important to keep asking the questions she asked about how we live, and why, and it makes me grateful that we have Cusk and Heti and Levy and Maris still asking them.In Calypso (Little, Brown), David Sedaris’s essays marry meditations on family, suicide, grief and mortality with the hazards of bodily functions and frequent travel for his massively popular public readings. Sedaris is as much standup comic as writer, making this a great audio and one for the car journey. I’m currently reading The Female Persuasion by Meg Wolitzer, highly relevant in this fourth wave feminism moment and quietly gripping. I shall also be packing What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky (Tinder) by Lesley Nneka Arimah, whose New Yorker short stories I have enjoyed. Tsitsi Dangaremba’s This Mournable Body (Graywolf) isn’t out until August, but I shall read it before summer’s end.Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile (Penguin) really made me think about how I think. I am also rereading Homer’s Iliad (the Robert Fitzgerald translation) and making my way through Susan Wise Bauer’s History of the Ancient World (Norton).The Road to Unfreedom (Bodley Head) by Timothy Snyder is a brilliant and disturbing analysis of the rise of authoritarianism in Russia, Europe and the US in the second decade of the 21st century. Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the political crisis currently engulfing the world.In Enlightenment Now (Allen Lane), Steven Pinker extols the amazing achievements of modernity, and demonstrates that humankind has never been so peaceful, healthy and prosperous. There is of course much to argue about, but that’s what makes this book so interesting.Yuval Noah Harari’s new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, will be published on 30 August by Jonathan Cape.I’m sure Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is going to be great – at least if The Flamethrowers is anything to go by. In Ma’am Darling, 99 Excerpts from the Life of Princess Margaret (4th Estate), Craig Brown achieves the impossible by finding a tone in which to write about monarchy. Not bitchy, not snide, not angry, but not fawning nor deferential either. Just funny.I am rollicking through Pretend I’m Dead by Jen Beagin, which is one of the funniest, most twisted and freshest things I’ve read in a long time. It follows the fortunes of Mona, who cleans houses and falls for a man she calls Mr Disgusting. Beagin combines deep compassion and irreverent humour to create characters with nasty, wonderful, human flaws. Helen Barrell’s Fatal Evidence, Professor Alfred Swaine Taylor and the Dawn of Forensic Science is an engrossing read. It follows the career of Taylor, a remarkable scientist who gave evidence at the trial of William Palmer, “The Rugeley Poisoner”, pioneered the study of forensic medicine and let Charles Dickens nose around his laboratory. Barrell explores Taylor’s (occassionally bizarre) cases, his public and private persona and his wide-ranging interests, which included geology and photography. Her description of the ways in which forensic experiments evolved is as fascinating as the courtroom dramas they accompanied.Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver) collects Audre Lorde’s essays and poems together for the first time in the UK. I look forward to getting stuck in to Talking to Women, Nell Dunn’s 1964 conversation about sex, money, work and art with a group of friends – including the writer Ann Quin and pop artist Pauline Boty.My love affair with the explosive, erotic, modernist poetry of Apollinaire is the one enduring passion in my life. Many of his best poems were written when he was a soldier fighting on the front lines in WW1. It was Apollinaire who invented the word, Surrealist. In Zone: Selected Poems of Guillaume Apollinaire (NYRB), Ron Padgett’s translation from the French (Padgett wrote the poems for the bus driver poet in Jim Jarmusch’s film, Paterson) is pitch perfect and dazzling.I will also reread four books I initially read very fast, mostly because the skill of the writing itself is the main event in all of them: The Years by Annie Ernaux, Kudos by Rachel Cusk, The Little Virtues by Natalia Ginzburg (Daunt) and Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan (Faber).If you have not already met The Secret Barrister (Macmillan), he or she makes an entertaining and acerbic holiday companion for those who don’t switch off their brains in summer it seems our resource-starved legal system is poised on the brink of not working at all. Tessa Hadley’s short stories, Bad Dreams (Cape), are simple and artful and leave you wanting more. Didier Eribon’s memoir Returning to Reims (Allen Lane) is a haunting book, fiercely political and deeply personal I shall be thinking about it this summer and for many seasons to come.Chantal Mouffe’s For a Left Populism (Verso) is influencing left parties as they enter government, from Greece to Portugal to Mexico. It is a beach-sized introduction to a major left thinker of the 21st century. Mike Davis’s Old Gods, New Enigmas (Verso) is a challenging re-exploration of Marx in the light of the atomisation of class struggle, the climate crisis and the centrality of cities to social justice struggles. Patrick Langley’s debut novel Arkady comes beautifully presented by Fitzcarraldo. What’s not to like about a book where revolutionaries take over a city in the north of England?People always say not to judge a book by its cover, but people are wrong. Ashleigh Young’s collection of smart, funny, insightful and unexpected essays, Can You Tolerate This? (Bloomsbury), has a bright yellow cover, making it perfect summer reading. I love it. I’ve been telling people about Lucy Wood’s short stories ever since her debut collection came out a few years ago she’s back with another collection, The Sing of the Shore (4th Estate), and she’s better than ever. Finally, Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) is an astonishingly good evocation of rural England in the 1930s, complete with creeping fascism and the subjugation of women. It’s subtle and mesmerising and brilliantly detailed, and I’m going to lie down in a meadow and read it all over again.Fiction in English from Pakistan has redeemed its promise with dazzling consistency. Mohammed Hanif’s Red Birds (Bloomsbury) is a fresh marvel, describing with cool wit and steely yet tender intelligence the interlinked fates of antagonists in a forgotten war-scape – and the complicity of our own sheltered lives in remote conflicts. Anna Tsing’s The Mushroom at the End of the World (Princeton) is a poetic and remarkably fertile exploration of the relationship between human beings and the natural environment, and what can still be done to stem its rapid deterioration.The term neoliberalism provokes much choleric denial. But Quinn Slobodian’s Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism (Harvard) decisively establishes it as a coherent project, tracing it back to the political and intellectual synergies of the 1920s. Michelle Dean’s Sharp (Fleet), a portrait of 10 female writers and thinkers, is a bracing tribute to the life of the iconoclastic mind: a reminder, in our age of flashy hot takes, of the matchless power of sustained and elegant argument.Kept from the world by a crazed fundamentalist father, cowed herbalist mother and violent misogynist brother, it’s a miracle Tara Westover escaped her childhood in rural Idaho. Her memoir Educated (Hutchinson) brilliantly recounts her journey towards knowledge and enlightenment bravely, too – her family are still alive. With Rachel Cusk as with Karl Ove Knausgaard, you wonder what makes you keep turning the pages. But while he’s confessional, her narrator Faye lets other characters do the talking, giving little of herself away Kudos completes a remarkable trilogy. The crepuscular, dreamlike, post-1945 London that Michael Ondaatje invents in his novel Warlight (Cape) continues to haunt you long after the plot itself.Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan is the best first collection I’ve read for a long time: moving, technically adroit, clever in all the right ways, and full of brilliant small-scale effects as well as large achievements. Angela Leighton’s Hearing Things (Harvard) is as good as her previous book on poetic form – which is to say it’s terrific – and illuminates a great deal about the sound effects of poetry that cannot be disentangled from its page-sense. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos brings her enthralling trilogy to a well-judged conclusion, at once rounded and open.Now that Terry Pratchett is gone, Stephen King is one of the only authors I buy in hardback on publication day. His latest, The Outsider (Hodder), is both a detective and a horror novel, and it gripped me to the point of checking under the bed before I went to sleep. It reminded me of what it was like to lie reading by torchlight late at night, when camping in the summer.I’ve never been much of a reader of contemporary poetry, but I have been seduced by some of the brilliant young poets writing now, of whom Amy Key is perhaps my favourite. Her new collection, Isn’t Forever (Bloodaxe), is playful, surreal and enchanting but also rooted in brutal emotional honesty. She is writer of a rare and strange magic.I am lucky enough to have an advance proof of Mrs Gaskell and Me, the new book from the brilliantly gifted Nell Stevens: she describes it as a love letter to “her own very special, dear friend”, Mrs Gaskell, and I have it patiently waiting on my desk.On my bedside at the moment: Go, Went, Gone (Granta), a novel about the refugee crisis in Germany by Jenny Erpenbeck that is not only timely but masterful Matt Walker’s illuminating review of the science of sleep and how we’re all doing it wrong: Why We Sleep (Allen Lane) The Overstory (Heinemann), Richard Powers’ weird and wonderful novel about the intricate relationships among trees and humans and Carlo Rovelli’s mindbending The Order of Time.Liz Nugent’s Skin Deep (Penguin) is the perfect holiday read for those who like their escapism on the darker side. If Patricia Highsmith were Irish she might well have come up with this tale of a scarred woman who taints all she touches while remaining as charismatic as she is enigmatic.In The Smiling Man (Doubleday) Joseph Knox pulls off the “difficult second novel” with ease and considerable style. Labyrinthine Mancunian noir with the obligatory battered but dogged detective.Ambrose Parry, The Way of All Flesh isn’t published until late-August, but it’s a rip-roaring tale of murder amid the medical experiments of 19th-century Edinburgh. The book brings both city and period to colourful life and is a joy to read. It’s a collaboration between seasoned novelist Chris Brookmyre and his wife, consultant anaesthetist Marisa Haetzman.Irish lawyer Steve Cavanagh writes excellent courtroom thrillers set in the US. His latest, Thirteen (Orion), sees him at the top of his game. It features a serial killer who’s sitting on a jury. Terrific premise, and the resulting story doesn’t disappoint.I recently read Vivek Shanbhag’s Ghachar Ghochar (Faber), a perfectly formed short novel about a family in India undergoing a rapid change in fortune. Published in translation last year, it’s an admirably slim book – you could read it in one sitting – and for me it conjured up a whole world.I’d also recommend Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello), an exhilaratingly weird and funny Japanese novel about a long-term convenience store employee. Unsettling and totally unpredictable – my copy is now heavily underlined.Finally, I don’t think I’ll ever forget the day I spent reading Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador). I couldn’t put it down, and then it overwhelmed me so much I had to put it down, and then I had to pick it back up again. A beautiful, strange, intelligent novel. My favourite book for adults this year, by some margin, has been Fifteen Dogs (Serpent’s Tail) by André Alexis. It opens with two gods having a quiet drink at The Wheat Sheaf in Toronto and debating whether, if animals had human intelligence, they would be only as unhappy, or more unhappy, than humans. It’s unhinged, wise, sharp, witty and daring. I’ve also fallen in love with Rachel Cusk’s Outline trilogy her work is staggering.In the world of children’s books, I can’t wait to read Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War (Macmillan), set in the approaching shadow of the first world war. McKay couples warmth and grace with wry humour like nobody else out there.My recent (re-)reading includes Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita and Speak, Memory, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, and Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, all books that don’t need me to recommend them. I have, however, immensely enjoyed David Grossman’s A Horse Walks into a Bar (Cape) for its pitch-perfect black comedy and Jeet Thayil’s The Book of Chocolate Saints (Faber), easily the most original and formally inventive novel to come out of India in years.Uprooting her life, London-based Kamin Mohammadi relocated to bucolic Florence. Her glorious memoir Bella Figura is witty, intelligent and heartfelt in equal measure and will delight anyone dreaming of a summer holiday – or a brand new life – in Italy.Recently optioned to become a film, Katja Meier’s timely memoir Across the Big Blue Sea: Good Intentions and Hard Lessons in an Italian Refugee Home avoids easy sentiment in favour of honesty and humour. The African women we meet at this Tuscan refugee home are fierce, scared, brave, vulnerable — triumphant yes, but human too. A beautifully complex account.And finally, I cannot heap enough praise upon Freshwater, a daring, sexy debut. Raw and lyrical, Akwaeke Emezi’s semi-autobiographical narrative takes on sexuality, spirituality, family and more — all with a clarity that belies her 30 years.I basked in the interwar twilight of Cressida Connolly’s After the Party (Viking). The novel a beautifully written evocation of the era, and the woolly self-absorption of its party-going protagonist. However, it’s also a pitiless exercise in ideological revelation, as it becomes clear that the party in question doesn’t feature dancing until dawn and a sumptuous breakfast buffet, but men and women wearing black shirts, who greet each other with fascist salutes. In a year that’s seen bigotry of all kinds on the rise, and the storm clouds of nationalist intolerance gathering on the near horizons of Europe, Connolly’s novel achieves the rare feat of at once summoning that foreign country, the past, then returning us, uncomfortably, to a contemporary Britain with a burgeoning fatherland complex.I have just finished reading The Reactionary Mind (Oxford) by Corey Robin. So many writers and thinkers today, East and West, are questioning the rise of conservatism, populism and tribalism. What makes Robin’s book extraordinary is the long-term pesrpective he introduces in this book. Robin shows that Trump is not a break from the conservative tradition, in fact, he is the fulfilment of a tradition that goes all the way back to Edmund Burke and his reaction to the French Revolution. It is a deeply thought-provoking book with utmost clarity and astonishing depth.What struck me about Neel Mukherjee’s novel A State of Freedom (Vintage) was the mesmerising complexity and the sharpness mixed with compassion and empathy. All the stories are beautifully written, and while they remain semi-independent, they are also subtly interconnected. Long after I finished it I realized the characters were still with me, vivid, compelling, haunting.Janesville: An American Story (Simon \u0026amp Schuster) by Amy Goldstein is incredibly well-researched, empathetic and moving. Political experts and pundits talk about “the American working class” all the time, making massive generalisations without paying much attention to inidual stories, but this book is extraordinary in the way it sheds light on an industrial town in America’s heartland by masterfully combining analysis and storytelling.I’ve already read Tishani Doshi’s poetry collection Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods (Bloodaxe) but I know I’ll return to it many times. One of the poems talks about poets ‘holding the throat of life till all the sunsets and lies are choked out till only the bones of truth remain’ - that’s precisely what Doshi does in this intelligent, elegant, unflinching collection. It’s very much a collection for this moment in history, but one that will endure long past it.The publishing house And Other Stories has committed to making 2018 a Year of Publishing Women – I’m planning to work my way through their entire list for the year over the summer. First up: Fleur Jaeggy’s Sweet Days of Discipline, translated by Tim Parks. It is set in a boarding school in postwar Switzerland, the opening pages are spare and beautiful, with an intriguing darkness.This summer the book I’m telling anyone who asks me about is Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City (Tinder), a novel that’s a piece of communal vitality, choral in its urgency, one that squares up to the history of ision, makes contemporary disjuncture come alive on the page, doesn’t flinch, and demands change right now. The book I’ll take with me on holiday is Michael Ondaatje’s Warlight. I love his writing, I wait for his books.Now that America has come to seem so unsettled and so strange, two books help us to become more alarmed. One is Michèle Mendelssohn’s Making Oscar Wilde (Oxford). It charts the early rise of Wilde, with special attention to how, during the 1880s, his lecture tours in America, a country beguiled by novelty and in need of excitement, made his name. As long as it was new, it seemed, America wanted it. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is set in the American prison system, but manages to be a novel with its own worldview and its own textures, as much as a chronicle of a system that holds more prisoners per head of population than any other country in the world. On a more uplifting note, there is a wonderful doorstopper called Gillian Ayres (ArtBooks), with a text by Martin Gayford and David Cleaton-Roberts and examples of Ayres’s work that will lift your heart.Do you want to understand yourself? To understand why you say and do what you do? To know why you, and the rest of our human race, are capable of paradoxical extremes, from compassion to cruelty (even within minutes of each other)? With humour, sublime insight and supportive data, Robert Sapolsky serves up all the answers in Behave, his gem of an explanatory masterpiece.Many of us feel that an occasional lie is fine, perhaps when trying to protect someone’s feelings, or when pressured to maintain political correctness. Lying by Sam Harris is a timely, well-reasoned treatise exposing how wrongheaded such beliefs are. It proves out the lack of utility in lying, in any scenario. Yet, that is not the reason I prescribe this book. Rather, it is the palpable sense of liberation and relief that you will feel when you practice what Harris preaches. Such is the truth about lying.My most beguiling read lately has been Rupert Thomson’s Never Anyone But You (Corsair), a beautifully written fictionalised account of the decades-long lesbian love affair between surrealist artists and anti-Nazi activists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore. I’m currently very much enjoying Diana Evans’s novel Ordinary People (Chatto), which takes a forensic look at the pleasures and perils of marriage and parenting and modern London living. And, as a Londoner myself, and one who likes to make as many journeys as possible by foot, the book I plan to turn to next is Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse (Vintage), which promises to be an inspiring a piece of feminist psychogeography based on the experiences of several notable female city-strollers including Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf and Martha Gellhorn.What books are you reading this summer?

The 11th, Calypso, has just been published. His books draw on his life and the people he meets, with particular regard to his large, colourful family. He lives in West Sussex with his partner, Hugh Hamrik.Is it fair to say there is a lengthening shadow of mortality hanging over this collection?Not intentionally. I mean I always use my life as material and as I’m getting older I suppose it just makes sense that there would be. I don’t sit around wondering how many years I have left to live. But I do notice, like, what do you mean, another root canal?Why is your family so important to\u0026nbspyou?From the very beginning the way we hung out with each other was, I noticed, different to other families. In high school, when everyone was going to soccer practice or doing something else, none of us had anything, because it would have meant not being together. On Saturday night, nobody had a date. That would have been betraying the family. It just felt like the centre of the world, my family. I knew we weren’t important, but I knew we were important.Do you find that people become self-conscious with you, as though they’re either trying to get in or stay out of your books?Most often when someone says: “You can’t write about this,” it never would have occurred to me to write about it. It’s not that interesting. I hear it more from people I don’t know well. I think I have a pretty good idea of what people want known and what they don’t want known.And are you immediately aware of a situation that you’re going to write about? For example, when you found yourself with a small tumour in the vicinity of snapping turtles, did you think, here’s a story?I’d been thinking for a while that if you have your tonsils removed, a cat would like to eat them. Then I thought, “Well, I have this tumour, and I’d been hanging out with these turtles,” and I thought, “Well, a turtle would really like to eat my tumour.” And I was surprised by the things that got in my way, like the surgeon who said: “It’s against the law to give you anything I remove from your body.” That seemed unfair to me. So when that woman came up and said: “I’ll cut it out”, there was no guarantee she’d be a good character, but she was. I guess I thought if someone was going to pitch me the story of feeding a tumour to a turtle, I’d have said: OK!Your writing flows from your life. Is there ever an anxiety that the well is drying up?When I was younger, I wrote stories that you might tell if someone didn’t know you, and you wanted to give them a general idea of who you were. Now it’s more of an exercise of making something out of nothing, which doesn’t bother me. It’s harder to make something out of nothing, but the story can often be better. That’s where you’re really writing. I remember after I got out of college I had a boyfriend and he said: “Do you think someone’s just going to call and offer you a job?” And I said: “Yeah.” And do I think a story is just going to come to my door? Yeah.You write about your sister coming to see you at a gig, and you had someone close the door on her backstage, shutting her out of your life. It was the last time you saw her before she killed herself. Was that difficult to write about?I didn’t mean to write about that. I thought: “Oh my, am I really doing this?” I thought it was important to do because anything that makes a story more complex is good to do. What I didn’t say in that story was whenever you talked to Tiffany it took you weeks to get over it, because she’d say something so disturbing or make you so angry, you couldn’t stop thinking about it. Does it make you think you’re a heartless person?When I read that out loud on stage, I can’t believe I did it. I can’t believe I’m reading it. It is just as bad as it sounds. That you’re going to have someone close the door on that person’s face, and they’re going to commit suicide and you’ll never see them again... there’s not a way to make that funny. I read someone saying you can’t surprise a reader without surprising yourself, and in your life what surprise is there? But there are things, admissions that you can make, or scratch below the surface and say how you actually felt, and you can be there at your desk and you’re just shocked. So I think that was a situation where the reader can be surprised the exact way that I was surprised. I think the audience thinks that I’m monstrous.Your mother is very present in this book. It seems as if your storytelling comes from her. What do you think she would have made of your success?My mother died when she was 62 and her health wasn’t great. She couldn’t walk because she smoked so much. If my mother had lived I imagine she’d have had an oxygen tank or something. But if that weren’t the case I’d have said to my mother: “Would you come on tour with me? Would you come on stage and introduce me?” She’d have loved\u0026nbspit. Because she deserved attention.There’s a growing concern in publishing about cultural sensitivities. Do you make a point of ignoring them? A lot of times people will say after a reading: “I can’t believe what you said”, and I’m literally thinking: “What did I say?” I feel like so many of those issues are really just the enemies of comedy. After every show it’s something. There’s an essay where a woman shits in her pants on the aeroplane and I said it looked like she’d taken her skirt off a long-dead Gypsy, because I want people to see the colour of the skirt. I read that in Edinburgh and this young man comes up and says: “I have a bone to pick with you. I’m one-tenth Gypsy. I really don’t appreciate you using that word.” I’m like: “Call me when you’re nine-tenths Gypsy.” I mean, who isn’t one-tenth Gypsy? Writing isn’t propaganda. You live in England but America is the centre of your writing. Do you find it helps to have a distance from it?Yes I do. I mean, Donald Trump said recently that America is finally being taken seriously in the world again and so, not that it helps, when I’m arguing with his supporters, I live in the world and it’s actually not true at all. It does help to be away from it. You know I wrote something recently about guns, how difficult it is to get one here. And I was saying, despite the fact you can’t buy guns here, British people feel free. Is it that they don’t know what they’re missing or is the freedom they feel the freedom of not being shot to death in the classroom or movie theatre?What’s the last really great book you read?Homesick for Another World by Ottessa Moshfegh. I can’t remember the last time I laughed that hard at a book. Also Hunger by Roxane Gay. It opened my eyes to another world.Which genres do you avoid reading?I’m not a mystery reader. I’m not a big thriller reader. I don’t want to say never to either of them. You know when you read a really good book, you get so excited about writing and you think: “Wow, look at everything that’s possible.” And from a bad book you learn a lot. It’s easier to learn from a bad book because with a good book, if you knew how to do it, you’d be doing it yourself.Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?Moby-Dick. About 15 years ago, Esquire asked me to pick a classic I’d never read, and I started it and thought there is no way I’m going to finish this book, so I told myself I could not take a bath or wash my hair until I finished the book. I hated that book.Which books do you feel are the most overrated?Moby-Dick. And Joseph Conrad. I’m like: “Oh my God, can we please get to the point?”Which bookauthor do you always return to?I always return to Richard Yates, and I read Revolutionary Road once a year. I usually read The Easter Parade once a year as well. Flannery O’Connor I return to again and again. She’s such a good comic writer.• Calypso by David Sedaris is published by Little, Brown (£16.99).

But the scale of Ryanair’s operations also means that quite a significant number of people could be affected,” he said.One concern for Ryanair is that any cancellation comes with the memory of last winter’s travails still relatively fresh. Thousands of passengers had their flights cancelled due to a blunder in the airline’s staffing roster.“Their brand is built on being reliable bastards,” said Dan Gavshon Brady, a strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. “What the strikes threaten to do is question the reliability. They’re more resilient than others because they’ve never promised anything more than no-frills but deliver on what they promise.“But that also leaves them less margin for error, so when you get problems it threatens to affect your brand.”At one stage last year, it looked as if Ryanair might avert any escalation of tension with its labour force. In a reversal of the airline’s decades-old policy, O’Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, something he has once claimed would be less preferable than cutting off his own hands. It seemed like a watershed moment, albeit one forced by the airline’s staffing bungle.The mistake had left Ryanair desperately short of experienced pilots, giving them the whip hand over a management team keen to limit flight cancellations.O’Leary’s subsequent damascene conversion into a reluctant trade unionist was reminiscent of his 2013 vow to start being nicer to passengers – one made by necessity, through gritted teeth.A little more than six months later and unions representing both pilots and crew say recognitionhas not developed into engagement with their grievances.This time, while pilots in Ireland remain dissatisfied and plan to strike on 12 July, it is cabin crew who are most aggrieved.They have long complained of poor pay and working conditions and meagre employment rights as a result of Ryanair’s model of employing them via third-party agencies.As the  revealed last year, they are also subjected to disciplinary proceedings and public shaming if they do not hit sales targets designed to help Ryanair flog more scratchcards and perfume.Multiple crew unions, assisted by the the International Transport Workers’ Federation, have delivered a list of 34 demands to the company.The implication is that more strikes will follow unless the company comes to the negotiating table. “The onus is now on Ryanair,” said ITF general secretary Stephen Cotton.“Ensure that workers get the treatment they deserve, or more national unions may decide that strikes are the only way to make the company listen.“Ryanair has started to change, but we believe the culture at the top needs to change too in order to deliver on the promises it has made. “The close-knit corporate governance model that has been a feature of the company thus far is no longer appropriate for a major airline. An increase in independent representation on the board would give us greater confidence that Ryanair is serious about a new approach.” But Ryanair’s rapid growth and financial success remain core strengths and not everybody is convinced it will see the need to change.Chris Tarry, founder of aviation consultancy Ctaira, said: “Whilst this changes the rules of engagement at Ryanair the fact is that it starts from a position of the lowest costs and is consistently the most profitable airline.“There are different dynamics and flexing of muscles by labour but it’s all clearly manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab63457b584bfc16a9945645ca1e49994471b1d1/0_162_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=062e810e27ec0499618af1fc1936df68","title":"cabinet has chosen to listen to business future prosperity","story":"At 10pm on Friday night (I was in Tesco), I was stopped by a constituent who rather anxiously asked if agreement by the cabinet on Britain’s negotiating position on Brexit had been reached. I was able to reassure her that a statement had indeed been issued and she looked relieved.The collective position agreed by the cabinet mattered not just to Westminster and Brussels but more broadly across the country. And it matters because jobs and people’s financial security are on the line.Inevitably we will all be asked who the winners and losers from the agreement are and which type of Brexit is now on the table. To ask this question is to misunderstand that this is a real, live negotiation in which Britain’s position has just taken another evolutionary turn and in which no one will get exactly what they want. There will inevitably be more twists and turns and all sides need to show continued flexibility.What is now on the table is an association agreement. This is an existing relationship framework which the EU has encountered many times before and should be able to do business with. For that reason, I hope that the EU will take time to fully explore, with Britain’s negotiating team, what is in the cabinet statement. And that all MPs will take the time to do so too.If the EU rejects this cabinet position without further consideration then that only helps those who want a no-deal, hard Brexit, which I believe would be a disaster for Britain and the EU.Further details from the white paper are needed but it seems the main elements Britain is now proposing are a free trade area for goods, a facilitated customs agreement, reciprocal commitments on free trade – including issues such as close co-operation by relevant regulators and a role for the European court of justice (but it won’t be making decisions for Britain on legal interpretation of rules that we have signed up to).The proposed free trade area sounds remarkably like the common market, which many older voters will remember and many, according to my conversations locally, supported. Overall, this reflects the fact that Britain will be reverting to a trading and economic relationship with the EU and leaving the political relationship which so many voters objected to and which led to the 2016 referendum result. Britain is also calling for a close security relationship with the EU after March 2019. It seems obvious that this will be of mutual benefit to all citizens in Europe and many people will hope this is another strand to the ongoing BritishEU partnership which can be negotiated.It has taken longer than expected for a common cabinet position to be reached and for collective ministerial responsibility on Brexit to be fully reasserted. However, both have now happened and this is welcome.Leaving the EU was always going to be about compromises and trade-offs – as in any negotiation. This cabinet statement is an evolution of its position. Much detail remains to be seen and worked out – for example, I wait to hear what services firms think about the proposals, and many, many businesses in Britain benefit from EU agency membership or supervision, which needs to be nailed down.But recognition in the cabinet statement of the need to protect “the uniquely integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes that have developed across Britain and the EU over 40 years, and the jobs and livelihoods dependent on them”, means that the cabinet has very deliberately chosen to listen to business and not to swear at it or ask it to keep quiet. That is good news for our future prosperity.Nicky Morgan is Tory MP for Loughborough and a former minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c2531ff22288999f49c79791fcfe13e27d607fc/458_672_2769_1661/master/2769.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84ed7e64fac42ad88d2a6909f806b5fd","title":"our brexit solution free trade take control","story":"The Chequers cabinet deal means that parliament will again be truly sovereign, with the freedom to accept or reject new rulesMaking sure Brexit works for the whole United Kingdom has been a priority for the government from the very start. It is why we made strengthening the Union one of our objectives for the negotiations. It is also why we have been assiduous in sharing and discussing our plans with the devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.While the EU Withdrawal Act ensures that Brexit will work for all the devolved nations and our UK devolution settlements, the special requirements of Northern Ireland, which uniquely shares a land border with another EU member state, present a more formidable challenge.Both the UK and the EU have made a sincere commitment to the people of Northern Ireland: there will be no hard border. Equally, as a UK government, we could not countenance a future in which a border was drawn in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.The agreement that the cabinet collectively reached last week answers this challenge by proposing the establishment of a new free trade area for goods between the UK and EU. This will be supported by an upfront commitment to a common rulebook for goods and agricultural products and a business-friendly customs solution – the facilitated customs arrangement – that will deliver frictionless trade with the EU, while returning the freedom to operate an independent trade policy. It is a responsible and constitutionally appropriate solution, which will benefit the economies of the UK and the EU, and which respects both the sovereignty of the UK and autonomy of the EU. It also delivers on the result of the referendum.The UK will leave the EU on 29 March next year. Free movement will come to an end, restoring control of our borders. The supremacy of British courts will be restored, by ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK – giving us back control of our laws. And there will be no more sending vast sums of money each year to the EU, giving us back control of our money.In recent years, the EU’s rules and regulations on goods, developed during 40 years of UK membership and influence, have remained stable. UK businesses now trade according to those rules and most have told us they have no desire to see them changed. These rules allow for the frictionless trade that currently takes place between the UK and the EU. So it makes sense to incorporate a commitment to maintaining a common rulebook into our formal agreement, to allow that frictionless trade to continue in our new free trade area.After Brexit, the EU will no longer legislate for us. All laws will be passed by the UK parliament and the devolved legislatures. Parliament will be truly sovereign, with the freedom to accept or reject any new rules. But it would do so in the knowledge that if the UK decided to take a different approach, there could be proportionate consequences for our market access – as would be the case if we were to deviate from agreements made with any trading partner.The UK will continue to be able to influence the common rulebook through shaping European and international standards. Britain helped establish the global system of standards. The International Organisation for Standardisation was established in London in 1946. The International Electrotechnical Commission, which sets global standards for electrics, is even older it was formed in London in 1906. The UK will continue to influence through these international bodies. After we leave the EU, the British Standards Institute should also remain a member of the European Standards Organisation, which is not an EU institution.Making this commitment to a common rulebook, alongside a facilitated customs arrangement that uses technology to enable frictionless trade with the EU, will avoid disruption to the integrated supply chains that have been built between the UK and EU, while allowing us to reach out and strike trade deals with new partners. Crucially, it will also ensure that Brexit strengthens our Union by guaranteeing no hard border in Northern Ireland or a border in the Irish Sea.It is the right approach for the UK, the EU and the brighter future which together we both want to build.• David Lidington is the cabinet office minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9163d4be6ea4e5438fe55c55ebe5ca5e3221da/0_90_4858_2916/master/4858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ba5419eb1b531a263f16f82bb570e1d","title":"after chequers soft brexit is coming home cartoon","story":"Chris Riddell on the ‘rough creature slouching towards Brussels to be born’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country.

Could I find my place?On an overcast day in Oxford in 2003, a few weeks into the first year of an English literature degree, I found myself doing something out of character. I broke a rule. Rather than going to my scheduled tutorial, rather than sitting on the ungiving sofa and offering halting analysis of Middlemarch, I slotted a note into my tutor’s pigeonhole and darted out of Wadham College. I hadn’t told anyone I was going I was unsure if I would ever come back.I was unaccustomed to disobedience. I went to a large, fiercely aspirational comprehensive where for years I had been a picture of compliance. I had exceeded predicted grades and been garlanded at prize-givings. It followed that the result of such cheerful tractability and success should be continued tractability and success at the University of Oxford, the very place I was fleeing.As I rushed in my battered Converse, my heart thudded in weird patterns. I kept dropping things, stopping to scoop up my belongings. I couldn’t wait to get back to London, to my own bed, to my schoolfriends who were grownup-ly working in bars and bookshops, saving for gap-year adventures. I flopped on to a seat on the coach, alternating between weeping and snoring all the way down the M40. It was a bloody awful end to a bloody awful few weeks.Before I got to university, I had imagined that the much mythologised pressure of the place would come from on high: disciplinarian, gowned fellows would swoop around making all manner of unrealistic intellectual and organisational demands. But, on arrival, I found it was other students and their attitude to work that was most tricky.In the junior common room, over sweaty brie and cranberry paninis, the writing of essays was exclusively referred to as having an “essay crisis”. At dinner, in the grand dining hall, panicked girls asked how many paragraphs I had managed to write, how many more I intended to write that evening, if I was gearing up for an “all-nighter”. Was I worried about not having enough to say? Wasn’t I concerned that my ideas might be too thin? The whole business of thinking about texts – something I loved – was reframed as a pursuit full of risk and without pleasure.When studying for my A-levels, I had worked in a much more self-contained fashion. I did my homework in peace and quiet at the dining table. I stopped for regular dance breaks, stomping around the front room to MTV Base. But at Oxford the production of work came with an oppressive theatricality. I started to secrete myself away in my room, rather than engage in yet more competitive grandstanding about word counts. But there were other aspects of my fellow freshers’ behaviour that bothered me. I am not now, nor have I ever have been, a particular fan of Eminem’s oeuvre. But throughout that first fortnight the sentiments of the curt line “y’all act like you never seen a white person before” from The Real Slim Shady circled through my mind. The interactions I had with several students made me feel that my blackness was something curious, difficult to handle.At one of the endless icebreaker events, a history student told me that I must be really “into African beats” (what even are African beats?). A girl from another college launched into an expectant monologue about her gap year in Togo, keen to hear of my own “experiences of Africa”. My hair – arrayed in a cloud of messy twists – was the subject of profound speculation and inquiry. When I ventured into other Oxford colleges, the porters who guarded the entrances eyed me quizzically and checked my ID card with suspicion. In all fairness, my blackness was a surprise. As far as I could tell, in 2003 I was the only first-year undergraduate black male student reading English literature in the entire university. In my college, I was one of only two black freshers. (According to the official records, there were 21 British students who identified as black who accepted a place at Oxford that year. The total number of British students admitted was 2,940.)Lots of my closest friends at school were white and middle class, as were most of my teachers. So being in the minority was not unfamiliar. But in my A-level English class, there were people with Jamaican, Spanish, Polish, English, Pakistani, Irish and Nigerian heritages. Whiteness was surrounded by all kinds of racial ersity. So the very particular, ubiquitous whiteness of Oxford – a whiteness so self-confident that it didn’t notice itself, never needed to think critically about itself – struck the 18-year-old me. On many occasions in those first few weeks, it was my blackness that fellow newcomers found worthy of (awkward) conversation. Part of me now thinks about these interactions in an amused way often, it was youthful gaucheness. But I also have to be honest: those encounters – or microaggressions – left me feeling alienated and conflicted. Making these strangers face up to the cheapness of their interest in my heritage seemed unfriendly. So I remained silent, smiling, complicit. I knew that, if I were to launch into an anti-racist challenge, there were very few people of colour to come to my aid. I was fraught and sad, full of complicated anxieties about my sexual as well as my racial identity. How, I wanted to know, do you exist and survive as a black man in Oxford? How do you exist and survive as a black, gay man? I remember going to the welcome drinks for the university’s African and Caribbean students’ society. It was in a little basement bar filled with people drinking sticky shots and fluorescent cocktails. I largely withdrew I remember chatting with a Congolese zoology postgrad who looked as despondent about his surroundings as I did, without allowing the conversation to get very far. I spent the evening skulking by the exit and thinking I should be focusing harder on integrating with my white counterparts, rather than hiding myself away with the black folk. Did this society exist mainly because these young black people felt unwelcome at Oxford? I doubt things are very different for today’s BAME students – a few months ago, the admissions figures revealed that more than a quarter of Oxford colleges failed to admit a single black British student between 2015 and 2017.What I recall most vividly about those first few days, as I walked among sandstone and privilege, was feeling noticed and observed. Trying to shake off that sense of intense surveillance was what made me take the coach home on that grey Monday afternoon.My mother was gentle with me when I turned up without warning on her doorstep. For a few days, she left me to my own devices, letting me mooch around our maisonette. She offered me bowls brimming with her piquant chicken soup. Mum took her time before asking what had happened. I said I wanted to take a year out. She made a small and knowing snort, before calmly and evenly saying: “No. That is not the answer. Not the answer at all.” I needed, according to Mum, to find a way through whatever difficulties had made me run away, rather than dodging and delaying and deferring. I was, as she saw it, more than clever enough to figure it out.My mother can sometimes be a stubborn soul: if she sees one sensible way of doing something, then that is the way it will be done. In my earlier teenage years, such rigidity had sometimes created tension between us, but now, amid all of my unhappiness and fuzzy thinking, my mother’s certainty was useful. And kind. Three days after I ran away, Mum sent me back to Oxford with washed laundry, Tupperware full of delicious jollof and the memory of her keen glare. On the journey back, I thought of a trip we had made to Ghana a few months before I started at Oxford, when my mother and I went to bury my grandmother. Ghanaian funerals are protracted, demanding affairs, but throughout the noisy, painful process my tiny mother was the epitome of grit and poise. When I returned to my desk, I sometimes quietly remembered that, hoping I had inherited some of her resilience.I also thought about how university was a special, singular opportunity to experience things beyond the narrative of adversity young black men sometimes find themselves mired in – or have thrust upon them. I didn’t want to be another black boy crushed by a different kind of system. So I resolved to really, really enjoy myelf. I wrote a couple of shoddy plays. I wrote some outlandish essays – my favourite one argued that John Donne and Tracey Emin were, like, the same? I wore silly costumes to fancy dress parties – a recalcitrant baby one week, a 1950s secretary the next. I had “gatherings” in my room where people stretched condoms over the smoke alarms so we could puff away on our Marlboro Lights. I stood in the middle of a packed, sweaty house party and – doing what felt like the unimaginable at that point – confidently snogged a boy in front of everyone. I certainly don’t think I ever “mastered” being at Oxford. There were many occasions when I shoved my head under my pillow for a pause. But mostly I began to feel more in charge of the kind of time I was having.Not only did I learn about Tennyson and Woolf, I also learned how to articulate my emotions and anxieties. By opening up, I discovered that, beneath the shiny appearance of coping, those who would go on to become some of my closest friends had their own problems: profound homesickness, experiencing misogyny, classism, regionalism, the difficulty of starting a relationship in a strange new world. Sharing these stories was restorative. Talking through some of the absurdity I was presented with – the fragile public school boy who was affronted when I had the gall to say I “wasn’t sure” about the work of a poet he liked, or the girl whom I overheard describing me to someone as “erm, you know, the, erm, one who… erm…wears the scarves?”, rather than calling me black – was liberating. When my parents came to my graduation, we decided to begin the day by taking a quick turn around the college grounds. I walked them through the entrance I had bolted from years before. I pointed out the window of my first-year room now someone else’s bland posters surrounded the large mirror on the back wall.I remembered how, in my first spring term, I had stood in that room and looked in the mirror as I got myself ready to go on a date, with a girl. Two friends knocked on my door. Perhaps they had an inkling that going out with a girl might not, in the long run, be what I was after. But because they understood that I was trying to figure out what I actually wanted, and because it didn’t matter whether I was interested in boys or girls, or both or none, and because they wanted to see me happy, they bundled in, full of enthusiastic questions. They dispensed casual advice and rigorous critiques of my outfit. We whacked on some Beyoncé and danced around the room.The date was a total failure: she brought her friend with her, which I was not expecting the bar was too noisy to hear anyone speak. After extricating myself, I plodded home over the cobbles, overcome with embarrassment.But I tried as hard as I could to think otherwise: I reasoned that, when I got back to college, I would tell my friends what had happened. They would demand that I didn’t skimp on the detail. There would be red wine to ease the storytelling. They would be tickled by the ridiculousness of it all. And they would come up with consoling and clever wisdoms – observations I could never have come up with on my own.• Michael Donkor’s debut novel, Hold, is published on 12 July by Fourth Estate at £12.99.

This prequel to the hugely successful dystopian horror series explains the why and how of the social experiment. Devised by Dr May Updale (Marisa Tomei), who declares her interest as “psychological” rather than “political”, the controlled experiment is quickly co-opted by ruling rightwing political party New Founding Fathers’ chief of staff Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) into a chilling evening of sanctioned ethnic cleansing.The experiment is confined to New York’s Staten Island, chosen because of its largely black and Latino “demographic”, with residents offered a stipend of $5,000 to remain on the island, and bonus cash for active participation. Sabian is furious to discover that this socioeconomic group is “not proceeding in the manner we expected” – the locals congregate in community spaces rather than killing each other – and sends death squads in minstrel masks in the name of “social catharsis” and “population control”. Though the other Purge films were similarly interested in government conspiracy theory and class warfare, this timely instalment audaciously, and explicitly, frames the purge as racist. Imagery that evokes Charleston, the Rodney King beating and the Ku Klux Klan isn’t a shorthand but a disturbing literalisation of racially coded violence.Although DeMonaco wrote the script, African American film-maker Gerard McMurray steps in as director, overseeing a mostly black and Latino cast. Among them\u0026nbspare dreadlocked activist Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend D’mitri (Insecure’s Y’lan Noel), who strips down to his\u0026nbspvest and single-handedly takes on a team of tower-block assassins\u0026nbspin the film’s Die Hard-esque finale. The Purge films are B-movies, and so this ultraviolence mostly works, though its social commentary is served a little too rare to stomach easily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9adb670840da35440f02cb2ebec47c2c92c25f/71_269_4135_2481/master/4135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb75e4741bb036b7bf89dbaf3d7b2114","title":"eden hazard belgium brazil world cup","story":"There was a moment late in Belgium’s win over Brazil on Friday when Eden Hazard led a break. He charged into the opposition half, turned back inside and, as runners went by him, taking defenders with them, space opened up for a pass out to the left to the substitute Youri Tielemans. There was an overlap, a chance of a third goal that would have finished the game. Hazard saw it. He tried to play it. But his legs, for once, did not obey. The ball set off in the right direction but with nothing like enough pace Marcelo intercepted. Hazard had essentially been too exhausted to pass a ball 40 yards. Like the rest of the team, he was spent.If Brazil had found a late equaliser, there could only have been one winner in extra time. Belgium had given everything, including Hazard, who does not necessarily have a reputation for industry. That, and his slightly diffident personality, lay at the heart of his difficult relationship with José Mourinho at Chelsea. But here he ran until he could run no more.Hazard has said that his model was always Ronaldinho: he wanted to do his tricks and play with a smile on his face. He watched the Brazilian and copied his moves. He works much harder than Ronaldinho ever did and often wears a frown of concentration rather than the broad grin of his idol, but still, the original lurks beneath the surface he jokingly refers to Chelsea’s training ground as “Cobham-cabana”. And against Brazil, Hazard was exceptional, as all of Belgium’s front three were.His job, in a sense, was simple. This was not the inside-forward role he has been occupying for Belgium and that he has played for Chelsea over the past two seasons. In Kazan, he started wide in a 4-3-3 but with a brief to cut infield into the spaces left when Kevin De Bruyne dropped deep from his false 9 position. Hazard was up against the one potential weak link in the Brazil side, the third-choice right‑back, Fagner. Mexico’s Carlos Vela had dominated him early on in the last 16 clash in Samara Hazard treated him like a slightly cumbersome training cone. He succeeded with all of his first five dribbles.Roberto Martínez has often been accused of reckless naivety when it comes to tactics but the approach he took to beating Brazil – narrowing Belgium’s midfield and placing Romelu Lukaku in a wide-right role – shows he is smart as well as flexible. He will have a plan for France.Belgium also beat Brazil because, quite simply, they have very good players, in\u0026nbspparticular their front three of Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Lukaku, and – as he showed with a range of saves\u0026nbspon Friday – Thibaut Courtois. In\u0026nbspwhat is likely to be a tight semi-final, the goalkeeper could prove crucial.Belgium believe. That much could be taken from their celebrations after the final whistle in Kazan, as well from the manner they have celebrated the goals and wins throughout this tournament – with a sense of collective purpose and unity. That, more than anything, could help them become world champions.\u0026nbspAfter the match, Tite, the Brazil coach, retracted his earlier lament to God about all the injuries his side have suffered, but said this would have been a different game had Dani Alves not been ruled out before the tournament. It might have been a different game even if Danilo had been fit.Fagner was exposed and unable to cope. Brazil’s switch to 4-4-2 at half-time meant Gabriel Jesus offered a measure of cover, but by then Belgium led 2-0. As Romelu Lukaku bullocked down one flank, overwhelming with Marouane Fellaini and Thomas Meunier a Brazilian left that proved too geared to attack, Hazard sliced away on the other side: two different threats, both released by Roberto Martínez’s brave tactical shift, both devastatingly effective.It was a performance that could have long-term consequences. The situation at Chelsea is farcical. Antonio Conte may be sacked next week, or he may still turn up for work, the world’s most implausible George Costanza, to take training when the first wave of players return for pre‑season on Monday.There has been talk for years about Real Madrid possibly making a move for Hazard, and it has grown louder of late, while Hazard notably did not play down talk of a transfer after the FA Cup final in May.Although it is hard ever to be sure what is posturing, Cristiano Ronaldo’s representatives are at least in some sort of negotiations with Juventus. If the vacancy does not open up this summer, it will sooner rather than later. Florentino Pérez, the Madrid president, is often swayed by World Cups. After Mesut Özil in 2010 and James Rodríguez in 2014, could Hazard be his big post-tournament splurge this year?Marouane Fellaini proved too hot for France to handle a year out from their hosting of Euro 2016, with two goals before half-time at the Stade de France, before Radja Nainggolan and Eden Hazard added two more after the break. It was France’s second defeat since the 2014 World Cup, and proved a portentous sign before their loss to Portugal in the final at Saint‑Denis a little over 12 months later.The last time the sides met competitively was in the King Hassan II Cup in Casablanca as preparation for the World Cup later that year. A single second‑half goal from Zinedine Zidane was enough to separate them, with France going on to \u0027win’ a mini-league also including Morocco and Glenn Hoddle’s England, who drew 0-0 with Belgium before losing on penalties.France won the battle for pride in Puebla at the Mexico World Cup, claiming third place with two goals in extra time after the 90 minutes ended 2-2. Jan Ceulemans had given Belgium the lead, before Jean-Marc Ferreri and Jean-Pierre Papin hit back, with Nico Claesen levelling things. Goals from Bernard Genghini and Manuel Amoros condemned Belgium to fourth place after both sides had lost their respective semi-finals 2-0.\u0026nbspWith eight teams competing in France at the 1984 European Championship, the hosts were in impressive form on their way to a first major international title. Both sides had won their opening games – Belgium 2-0 against Yugoslavia, the hosts 1-0 against Denmark – but a hat-trick from Michel Platini and one each from Alain Giresse and Luis Fernández made for a miserable night for the Belgians in Nantes.The first major tournament match, indeed the first non-friendly, between the sides came in France at the last World Cup held before the second world war – and the final one without a group stage. The host nation’s win in their opening game, courtesy of a first-minute goal from Émile Veinante and a double from Jean Nicolas, set up a quarter-final meeting with eventual champions, Italy, who won 3-1 in Paris.Certainly if this were a head-to-head audition against Neymar – football matches very rarely are these days, except when impressionable presidents are involved – there was only one winner.Neymar increasingly feels a victim of his own celebrity, his need to be the star in the biopic of his own life. His best football came at Barcelona, when the weight of Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and the entire post-Cruyffian machine forced a measure of submission to the collective.Without that, at Paris Saint-Germain and with Brazil, his solipsism runs unchecked – as it would if you had been told since you were a child that you were the new Pelé. Hours after the final whistle, he wandered alone around the car park outside the Kazan Arena, either unable to find the Brazil bus or reluctant to board it, a poignant figure struggling under the toxic combination of his own ego and his country’s expectations.Hazard is very different, quieter, more introverted, less self-confident. He will not illuminate a room with a smile. He will not send hordes of impressionable teenagers clutching the latest snap of their hero to the hairdressers. He may not relish the circus that Madrid so often becomes.But he will follow a tactical plan, he will not overelaborate and he will devastate a full-back who gives him half a chance. In a post-Ronaldo world, Hazard may be just the non-celebrity Real Madrid need. Whatever else he is, he is a supremely skilful and effective footballer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ad4cf8c543c1c1211971374f1c3668f3de94ac/0_258_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1067c977a462ec67d5560f49ed6a932e","title":"england sweden world cup quarter final match report","story":"At the final whistle, the victorious players converged on one another. It took a few seconds for them to gather their breath and then, finally, they could join the party that was already under way behind the goal to their right. England had booked their place in a World Cup semi-final and this kind of euphoria has been so long coming – more than a quarter of a century since the last occasion – it was probably just inevitable they would soon be dancing on the pitch as well as in the stands.If we were to be picky, a legitimate argument could be made that England will need to play with more finesse if they are to harbour serious ambitions of winning this competition. They will have to pass the ball more efficiently and maybe, in possession, show a touch more arrogance, in the manner of a side that really believes they are the elite and this is where they belong. France, for example. Or Belgium.For now, however, Gareth Southgate and his players are fully entitled to cherish these moments bearing in mind the last time it happened Bobby Robson was manager and Spitting Image’s puppet of the England coach was a senile worrier called Rubbisho. Turin, 1990, with the penalties, Gazza’s tears and all that, is written into England’s history. This time, maybe there will be a happier ending. But the real glory will only be attainable in Moscow next Sunday and, on this evidence, they should not hold any fears about meeting Russia or Croatia in Wednesday’s semi-final.Why not be confident, after all, when England have now scored as many goals, 11, as Sir Alf Ramsey’s in 1966? Eight of them, astonishingly, have come from set-plays, the latest being the header from Harry Maguire to swing this game in England’s favour. Some might even argue they are too reliant on scoring this way. For that, show them the tape of Dele Alli’s goal or the other occasions when they threatened to add others.England played stodgily at times, particularly in the first half, but it was a controlled performance overall and, importantly, the four players who would have missed the semi-final had they received another booking remained out of the referee’s notebook. Southgate’s team will be at full strength on Wednesday. Anything, as he says, is possible.At this point, as is becoming the norm, it is probably worth noting the now-familiar reminder from England’s manager that it is still not time to get too carried away. Not yet, anyway. Equally, Southgate also made the point that his team can play considerably better than they did for long spells of their latest victory. Early on it was disconcerting to see the way his team struggled, the way passes were misplaced and the suspicion, however briefly it passed, that the occasion had got to a couple of his players.In their previous matches, England had been so quick to set the tempo, passing the ball incisively and making it clear very quickly that they would be happy to take the game to their opponents. That was not the case here. Ultimately, though, that sluggish start will quickly be forgotten and once they had taken the lead, half an hour in, there were only fleeting moments when England looked in any danger.Until that point, it had been a laboured performance. But then England won their first corner. No other player in the World Cup has won more aerial challenges than Maguire and it was strange, to say the least, that Sweden had designated Emil Forsberg to mark him. Maguire had a seven-inch advantage and made it count. It was a mismatch, the ball thudded off Maguire’s forehead, powered in to the right of the Swedish goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, and England had scored from a corner for the fourth time in this tournament.Sweden will reflect on the save that Jordan Pickford made from Marcus Berg’s header at the start of the second half and, though he was needed only sporadically, this was another splendid performance from England’s goalkeeper, showing again that he can handle the big occasion.Pickford pulled off another brilliant save at 2-0, when Viktor Claesson had the chance to change the complexion of the match. It was England’s first clean sheet of the tournament and there was never a concerted spell when Sweden – willing but limited opponents – managed to pin them back.Instead, it might have been an even more straightforward victory if some of England’s better chances had fallen to Kane rather than Raheem Sterling. His first one-on-one with Olsen ended in a late offside flag, though the England player was not to know that. The second would have made it 2-0 at the interval and, though it was largely inconsequential in the end, this is the stage of the competition when Southgate desperately needs his front players to have ice in their veins. For all his many qualities, Sterling turns to slush too often and as long as that is case he will struggle to improve an England record that has now stretched to two goals from 42 appearances.No big deal, though. Sterling played his part, always looking to create mischief, and the way he stretches defences makes up in part for his erratic finishing. As for Kane, another goal from England’s leading scorer would have meant him outscoring Paolo Rossi when he won the Golden Boot in 1982, Gary Lineker when he did the same in 1986 and Toto Schillaci in 1990. As it was, Kane worked hard without getting many opportunities to add to his total and, strangely, that is one of the areas where England need to improve. Penalties and corners aside, Kane’s teammates are not creating enough chances for their principal scorer.If that can be put right, England should be reasonably confident against anyone. For now, however, this is not a time to be too critical. Jordan Henderson had a fine match and England were largely untroubled once they had their second goal. For that one, Kieran Trippier’s pass gave Jesse Lingard the chance to clip the ball over from the right. Alli was at the far post to head the ball in and, half an hour later, the players in red were behind that goal, dancing in front of the England fans, daring to believe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a970a115703e53648bead1f4c7cb4c44772f7031/0_128_1982_1189/master/1982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e7b3dcaa9458de1bd74dd04afe899f","title":"gareth southgate england win semi finals world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate has spoken of his pride at following in the footsteps of Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Bobby Robson and Terry Venables in becoming the fourth England manager to steer the national side to the semi-final of a major tournament.England will compete in the last four of the World Cup for the first since 1990 in Moscow on Wednesday with Southgate having guided the least experienced squad at the tournament to within 90 minutes of the final. He paid tribute to his players and staff and the manager – who had doubted he would ever shrug off the stigma of being relegated with Middlesbrough early in his coaching career – contemplated the opportunity that awaits.“To be in charge of people who give as much energy, and give me as much as they have over this period of time, is very special. It’s great to see the players sat with their families out there. Without the commitment of a couple of wives who allowed their husbands to come back after giving birth … I\u0026nbsphope they feel part of this as well.“It hasn’t always been like this when representing England. You only have to go back 18 months and I said to them that having some kind of success with England would be so much bigger than any success they’d enjoy with their clubs. That is maybe starting to register now.Southgate offered a nod, too, to the much-criticised Roy Hodgson for blooding so many younger players during his tenure in charge. Nine members of Southgate’s squad in Russia had been on the pitch at some stage as England subsided so ignominiously to Iceland at Euro 2016 in a defeat that seemed to create a disconnect between the supporters and the national team. That rift seems repaired.“They didn’t have big-match experience two years ago and, under pressure, they suffered,” said Southgate. “Roy took a lot of criticism, but he was brave enough to put them in and deserves credit for that. Without that experience, we wouldn’t be here. Young players will suffer at times and have days when they can’t cope or adjust. But the experiences two years ago put a lot of those lads in better stead. They’re two years further on and have benefited from that as well. There’s a humility about them, a recognition of where they were 18 months ago and the work that was needed to get them where they are now.“These guys are all England fans. Some have been at tournaments in the past as supporters. If not, their families have. They’ve all worn the shirt as kids and are now proud to wear the shirts as players. As a group they’re tighter. A lot have come through the junior teams together, and they’ve been able to park their club rivalries at the door.“You can say the same for people like Tom Heaton, Adam Lallana and Jake Livermore who were on standby and trained with us before we left, and whose contribution was brilliant. And people like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been messaging me, or Joe\u0026nbspHart, who made a massive save\u0026nbspfor us in the qualifier in Slovenia. People who have played a massive part in getting us to where we are. None of that should be overlooked. In years to come, they’ll be stronger. But this\u0026nbspwas a huge opportunity for us, and not something we wanted to miss out on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c8ab19011140e417bb683a40677e728584934d/68_165_1879_1127/master/1879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbcf7d0e222f4c572d727148513984df","title":"sweden 0 2 england world cup quarter final player ratings","story":"Jordan Pickford is the pick of England’s bunch while Sweden’s danger man Emil Forsberg is no match for Harry MaguireCould not really have been expected to do anything about either goal and got a vital hand to the ball to thwart Sterling when one on one. 6In for the suspended Mikael Lustig but struggled to fill those boots..

He deserves credit for battling defensive work and troubling Pickford with a fizzing shot. 5The Hull City midfielder returned after missing the Switzerland game but failed to make much difference and was largely anonymous. 5Could not assert himself, despite an enviable work rate and was punished accordingly by England’s rampaging forwards. 4 Scored the decisive goal against Switzerland but could not perform heroics in Samara and no match for Maguire’s head in the penalty area. 4Unlucky to be flagged offside when he got behind Maguire and produced two decent efforts which required Pickford’s intervention.

I felt sadness, there is no doubt about that, but defeats are part of sport. Having played in many important tournaments for my clubs and my country I know that we do not live just through wins, we have to live through defeats as well.Brazil were beaten by a team with a very good strategy and they were helped by the fact Brazil’s players were not able to finish off their chances. It was not a disaster and, even though the expectations placed on the team were huge, we have to remember that there are other great teams – and Roberto Martínez’s Belgium is one of them.Belgium have a lot of quality and were extremely disciplined. Their marking was superb throughout and they made the game very compact and benefited from that. They also had a plan for how to attack Brazil and executed it well.After the defeat against Belgium there has been some speculation about Tite getting sacked but I think he should stay. His work has only just started and the positives have far outweighed the negatives.People sometimes get too attached to the results and say things like “if we don’t win the World Cup we have to change the coach”. However, they forget the process that the team have been through and they forget all the improvements that Tite has been responsible for since he started.He must be given more time and we must have continuity so that we can start working towards winning our sixth World Cup in 2022.For Brazil to improve we must trust in our system. Tite is doing well. We need to improve but we do not need to start all over again.Being eliminated from a World Cup is hard – I know that from my own experience. The tournament takes place every four years. Going out is a delicate situation and each person deals with it differently. All players share the sadness but we deal with it in different ways.After a heavy defeat I have always wanted to stay with the team. I have not wanted to be on my own, there is no way I could have isolated myself.As the saying goes: when we win, everyone wins and when we lose, everyone loses. I never felt comfortable being on my own but I respect people who would rather collect their thoughts that way.As for the Brazil players it is difficult to pick out one who was better than the others. There were high hopes for Neymar to be miles ahead of the others but that is a bit unrealistic and during the matches we have seen that many players can step up and take that responsibility.In some games Philippe Coutinho played really well and in others Neymar and Willian were dominant. However, I always think it is important to stress how vital it is that the team works together and that all 23 players are valued. For example, Douglas Costa came on and changed the game against Belgium.Another player who performed well was Casemiro and there is no doubt that Brazil missed him in the quarter-final. He offers so much in midfield – he gives balance to the team and he also makes the other players believe. He gives them the knowledge that they have security in midfield and it was clear that was not the case against Belgium all the time.As for Neymar, he has, at times, made the most of challenges that have been made on him – but he has been very heavily marked as well. But everything is a learning curve and there were times, especially against Belgium, that he did not try to exaggerate the tackles that were made against him.As France eliminated Uruguay and Brazil fell to Belgium we have two semi-finals without a South American team. It is the first time since 2006 that has happened. Why? It is difficult to say but it is not as if Brazil were that far away from getting an equaliser to take the game to extra time. Uruguay with Edinson Cavani would have been a tougher opponent for France while Colombia were eliminated on penalties against England.South American football has always been, and still is, known for its technical nature. That has not changed and I do not think there is one reason for all the teams failing to reach the semis. We did not lose the “ginga”, our way of play and our iniduality, but the European teams have improved a lot.What can Brazil do going forwards? Simple: we have to analyse the mistakes we made in the defeat and work on how to erase them. They should not happen the next time we have an important game.As captain, I always think it is a good idea to show the rest of the group that there were positives as well as negatives in a tournament. We have to keep in mind what was good, what was positive in our performances, because one single defeat cannot define the future of the team. We must keep our heads up and always try to improve because football is the same as life – we are all human beings and we should always look to improve, whether it is on the pitch or off it. We make mistakes – and then we try to learn from them to ensure we do not repeat them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf50745d3df6603f09e5cfd739bea91b3b03c44d/0_0_3936_2624/master/3936.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c69e89d65b45e4bc8a0a711e759e590 880w","title":"russia v croatia world cup 2018 quarter final live","story":"ET 29 min: Zobnin, from 25 yards, hits a screaming daisycutter towards the bottom left.

I don’t think he’s stopped shaking his head sadly since the equaliser went in. He looks utterly dejected.ET 26 min: The roof of this stadium is currently sailing towards Iceland.The free kick is curled into the box by Dzagoev. An outswinger. Fernandes rises highest, and flashes a header into the bottom left! Russia save themselves! There was always going to be another twist, wasn’t there?ET 23 min: Smolov dances down the left, reaches the byline, and checks back. He hooks into the centre, and Subasic does very well to claw away with red shirts lurking. Then Pivaric deliberately elbows a ball floating down the Russian right. That’s a booking, and a free kick in a very interesting position!ET 21 min: A corner for Russia down the left. It ends up being half cleared, and falling at the feet of Kuziaev, just to the right of the D. Kuziaev hits a first-time pearler, through a thicket of players, but straight at Subasic, who snaffles. Anywhere else, and that was surely a goal! But the keeper can hang on.ET 20 min: Kudriashov clatters into Kovacic down the Croatian right. A free kick, and a chance for Croatia to load the box, and put this out of Russia’s reach. Modric takes the free kick. It ends up at the feet of Mandzukic, who curls a soft shot into Akinfeev’s arms.ET 19 min: A yellow card for Gazinsky, who trips a marauding Mandzukic. He’ll miss the semi should Russia turn this round.ET 17 min: Modric sprints 60 yards to keep in a loose ball near the Russian right-hand corner flag ... but his attempt to play the ball off Kudriashov and win a corner end in failure as he sends it along the byline to Akinfeev. A lot of effort for nowt.ET 16 min: Kovacic and Modric try to up the tempo and combine down the left. It nearly opens Russia up, but Kovacic takes a heavy touch and runs the ball out for a throw. But Croatia are one minute closer to that England showdown.And we’re off again (again)! Croatia get the ball rolling for the final chapter ... unless Russia can force a penalty shootout.There’s just time for a high ball to be pumped into the Croatian box. Subasic goes up, claims, is fouled, drops, and cries in pain. But he’s up and about quickly enough. And that’s that for the first period of extra time. Is there to be one last twist in this Russian fairytale? Or will Croatia close it out, and secure the semi-final with England that’s now within their grasp?ET 15 min: ... Erokhin eyebrows a header wide right from close range. There will be two additional minutes in this first period of extra time.ET 14 min: Now it’s Russia’s turn to win a corner on the right.

Russia replace Golovin with Dzagoev.Croatia go straight up the other end and win a corner on the right. Vida rises on the spot to meet the set piece, and sends a slow downward header into the bottom right! All in super-slow motion! He tears his shirt off and peels away in wild celebration. Croatia are less than 20 minutes from the semis!ET 10 min: Lovren plays a sleepy pass in the midfield, and Golovin races towards the Croatian box. He slips a pass inside for Smolov, who threatens to break into the box. Lovren comes back and gently eases him out of the way. Russia want a penalty, but they’re not getting it. Lovren redeems himself.ET 9 min: Croatia are keeping hold of the ball, but they’re not doing a great deal with it. Modric has been uncharacteristically quiet. What they’d do for a spark from the little man.ET 7 min: Subasic better be good for the remainder. Because Vresaljko forces Croatia into making their bonus extra-time fourth substitution. If the keeper goes down again, it might be curtains for the Croats. Anyway, here comes Corluka.ET 6 min: As play pootles on, Vrsaljko is still off the park being assessed. ET 4 min: It’s just as well Subasic is good to continue. Because they may have to hook Vrsaljko, who appears to have tweaked something himself. He limps off for treatment. “If Croatia can’t find a way through then there is no reason to think England or even Belgium or France can,” argues Robin Hazlehurst. “Russia nailed on to win the thing by winning every knockout game on penalties? Is that good? Well, they all count.”ET 2 min: Kuziaev hopes to break into the box but he’s eased off the ball by Lovren and Vida. It doesn’t look like Russia are merely playing for penalties.And we’re off again! It now looks like Subasic merely suffered an attack of cramp, rather than pulling a hamstring. He’s been massaged furiously, and is good to continue. Russia restart, and immediately win a corner down the right. From which, the ball drops to Erokhin six yards out. But he can’t sort his feet out to get a shot away. Croatia clear.Could England’s day get any better? The side they’ll face in the semi-final will have an extra 30 minutes of stressful football in their legs. We’re going to extra time!90 min +4: Subasic looks a little less pained at the moment. Smolov barrels down the right and reaches the byline. Instead of crossing, he belts hard, straight at the injured netminder. Subasic parries well, and the ball’s hacked upfield.90 min +3: The corner leads to nothing, but Croatia, who have a stricken keeper, are another 60 seconds closer to safety.90 min +2: Subasic is still guarding the goal, of course ... there’s no point him going off yet. But if he’s expected to move at speed for anything ... well. Croatia do the right thing by pressing hard up the other end. Kovacic wins a corner and Modric wastes some time taking it.90 min: Croatia make their final substitution ... in 90 minutes. Kovacic comes on for Kramaric. And then what happens? Subasic goes to gather a loose ball, the result of an Erokhin and Vrsaljko battle down the Russian left. As he bends to stop it going out for a corner, he clutches the back of his leg. His hamstring is gone! And there will be five additional minutes. Subasic can hardly move! This could become very dramatic. He can be replaced in extra time - the new fourth sub rule - but Croatia need to survive these final stages first! What a farcical end to Croatia’s campaign this could be!88 min: Nope. Vida sends his header over the bar, and Lovren was pushing anyway.87 min: Modric plays a diagonal ball, left to right. It should be intercepted by Erokhin, but he heads it behind for a corner under no pressure whatsoever. A bonus corner for Croatia. The great Russian adventure can’t end like this, can it?84 min: Zobnin tries to flick a pass down the left. It’s handled by Vrsaljko. Free kick, and a chance for Russia to load the box. Golovin sends an inswinger into the mixer. Lovren does very well to crash a header clear under extreme pressure. The tension is rising.83 min: Pivaric chases after a heavy pass down the left. Fernandes ushers ball and man out of play for a goal kick. The crowd respond to another request for volume from their manager. We’re entering the last nervous few minutes. Every little helps.81 min: Fernandes skips down the right. He reaches the byline and pulls one back into the box. Vrsaljko clatters clear, Smolov not in range. This has got very scrappy again.79 min: The impressively troublesome Dzyuba, who has been tiring, is replaced by the midfielder Gazinsky. Russia revert back to one up front. Here’s Adam Kline-Schoder: “It seems to me that Croatia, when they are in full flow (case: Argentina), are nigh on impossible to stop and play some beautiful football. But, they seem to have a hard time getting to that point. Russia have disrupted Croatia’s play today by forming two solid banks of four, thus forcing Modric back to close to his own third to receive the ball and reducing his effectiveness. In other words, I think they’ve generally prevented Croatia from playing the way they want, and they’re perfectly happy to try and nick a goal on the counter. And honestly, that method has got them this far, so it’s difficult to poke too much fun at. They all count!”77 min: Modric takes. Mandzukic slaps a header over the bar.76 min: This is getting a little scrappy as extra time looms and nerves kick in again. But then suddenly Modric makes good towards the Russian box. He lays off to the right for Kramaric, who chips for Mandzukic. He heads down to Modric on the spot: the resulting shot is blocked. For a second there, a goal of intricate brilliance looked like it was unfolding. Not quite.

The England winger seems to be coming in for quite a lot of criticism on social media because he missed two decent chances against Sweden. Depressingly, he is currently the lowest-scoring player out of England’s starters in both ours and the BBC’s player ratings systems.This seems remarkable, not least because Sterling wreaked havoc with his direct running at Sweden’s defence, causing them all sorts of problems throughout. Without his speed, gumption and creativity, England would have struggled badly to stretch and break down Sweden. Anyone with half a brain would realise he contributed significantly more than quite a few of his team-mates and certainly didn’t contribute significantly less. But hey, the dunderheaded majority seem to think that as he didn’t score a goal when he should have, it’s open season again. It’s difficult not to conclude that the Daily Mail and Sun have a lot to answer for on the back of their relentless hounding of the player in recent years. It seems he’s still paying the price for buying his mum a nice house, shopping at Greggs, driving a dirty car, flying with a budget airline and getting a tattoo.More England reaction: Happy, drunk man in charge of Barbecue sings song.Meanwhile in Sochi: Russia are taking on Croatia for the privilege of being beaten by England in next Wednesday’s semi-final. Scott Murray is manning the minute-by-minute report for that particular contest and would love you to join him.Fun fact: No fewer than 17 of the 23 players in England’s World Cup squad were not born on the previous occasion they reached the semifinals (1 July 1990).Among those who were still mischievous gleams in their fathers’ eyes – today’s goalscorers Harry Maguire and Dele Alli. Danny Rose was born one day after England’s 3-2 quarterfinal victory over Cameroon in 1990.Daniel Taylor, our chief football correspondent, was at the Samara Arena to watch England see off a fairly feeble Sweden challenge and advance to the World Cup semi-finals. Here’s how he saw events unfold.Gareth Southgate speaks: ““We knew we would have the majority of the ball, the question was whether we could break them down,” says England’s manager in an interview with the BBC. “We’d identified a few areas where we might do that and we got the goals from both of them.“We scored from set plays because we got into good areas on the pitch. Sweden are well-organised, they make things tough and over the years we’ve underestimated them. Today, our spirit was as good as theirs but our quality was a little bit better.”Sweden’s manager speaks: “What went wrong?” says Janne Andersson. “I am not sure anything went wrong as such. We didn’t get to our best. We had things under control until they had that corner.”Fabian Delph speaks: In an interview with the BBC’s Gabby Logan, the midfielder has just spoken about the weirdness of being at the World Cup, then going home to attend the home birth of his third daughter, the fans he met on the school run while on his mini-break from the England camp. He ends his interview by saying that he and his wife can’t decide on a name for the new born baby that the whole family agree on and finishes up by describing his other half as “a machine”. Hmmm ...Reward the likes of Jordan Pickford, Raheem Sterling, Kieran Trippier and Harry Maguire for their outstanding performances against Sweden with our handy gizmo.“It’s a great result,” says England’s goalkeeper to the Beeb. “We knew it was going to be difficult against Sweden. We know what they were going to bring to the part and we knew what he had to bring our A-game.”On the atmosphere: “It was quality,” he says. “England fans are different class. We really enjoy playing and when the fans are like that it makes us very relaxed. I think the last time England were in a semi-final was 1990 and I wasn’t born then. We can go and create our own history, but now it’s all about rest and recovery.”“It’s a great achievement for the team,” says the scorer of England’s second goal in an interview with the BBC. “We owed it to the fans back home because we’ve seen how they’re supporting us.” On his goal: “It’s always nice to score, espeically on an occasion like this but personally I didn’t think it was one of my better games. It was a real graft out there. It was important we had belief in our game plan, dominating possession. It was important that we stuck to what we were doing and moved the ball quickly.”He finishes up with a few kind words for England’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who was outstanding today. Here’s our snap report on England’s quarter-final win at the Samara Arena. We’ll have a more detailed report, along with post-match reaction, quotes and comment from the  posse at the Samara Arena shortly.Harry Kane: “Probably not,” says England’s skipper upon being asked if this win has sunk in yet by the BBC. “There was so much preparation for this game. I thought we were fantastic. Sweden made it tough ... long balls from the back ... lots of crosses ... we’re buzzing! We’re buzzing! We know there’s still a big game ahead – the semi-final. We just have to go again. We’re enjoying it. We’ve got to keep doing what we’re doing.”Harry Maguire: “We felt like we could dominate the ball today,” said the scorer of England’s first goal. “We could control the play. It was a bit sloppy towards the end of the second half when it was too open.” Easy for England: Their players embrace each other and salute the travelling England fans as the camera cuts occasionally to assorted Swedes sobbing in the crowd. Jordan Pickford made some excellent saves today, but despite the goalkeeper being called upon on three different occasions, the outcome of this game never looked in any doubt.Sweden were poor abject at times, but created enough chances to win the game nonetheless. If they’d taken those chances, the result going their way would have been a complete travesty. One suspects England had plenty more left in the tank if they’d needed it.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over. England are through to the World Cup semi-final, where they will face Russia or Croatia. Harry Maguire and Dele Alli got the goals as they overcame a Sweden side that made life rather easy for their English opponents in Samara.90+3 min: England’s serene procession to the semi-final is almost complete. They’ve had it pretty easy today, against a Sweden side that can be pleased with making it this far in the competition, taking some notably high profile scalps along the way. For all that, they haven’t done themselves justice today.90 min: Ludwig Augustinsson takes the free-kick and sends it screaming high over the bar. That is an awful effort. 89 min: Sweden win a free-kick just outside the England penalty area, right of centre.88 min: Sterling gets in behind Lindelof and tries to get a cross in from the left. It’s blocked and the ball breaks back into the square yard of no-mans land between Delph and Sterling. They both leave it to each other to do something with it and it spins it out of play. This is the kind of telepathy they’ve developed during their time together at Manchester City. 87 min: Harry Maguire gets booked for kicking the ball away in frustration after being penalised for a foul on John Guidetti. The two players exchange unpleasantries and Guidetti is booked too. 86 min: Another free-kick for England wide on the right after a foul on Lingard. Trippier whips in a good delivery, but Sweden clear.85 min: England substitution: Eric Dier on for Jordan Henderson. Sweden substitution: Pontus Jansson on for Emil Krafth.84 min: England win a free-kick wide on the right. Trippier’s delivery is uncharacteristically poor and goes straight out of play.84 min: Lingard tries his luck with a curling effort from distance, but it’s intercepted. 81 min: Jordan Pickford and John Stones both eff and jeff liberally and in the strongest possible terms in the face of Sweden’s Marcus Berg after England’s goalkeeper was forced off his line to pluck a ball towards the Swedish forward from the sky. I am not sure what exactly Berg done to displease them, but they seem very cross with him. Chill out, lads. 80 min: There’s a break in play as Krafth has to receive treatment for an injury. England’s players take the opportunity to get some fluids on board. 77 min: Another wonderful knee-height cross from Trippier that Sterling hopes to poke home at the far post. Krafth makes a crucial interception. 75 min: England substitution: Fabian Delph on for goalscoring’s Dele Alli. Referee Bjorn Kuipers is forced to intervene when Alli turns his back to the technical area and pretends he doesn’t know it’s him who is making way in a bid to waste time. Expect this exhibition of amateur theatrics to be cited as further evidence of the new, more “streetwise” England in the post-match coverage.72 min: Another good save from Pickford, who palms over the bar from Berg’s shot on the turn from 12 yards or so. The Swede should have scored their after being teed up by Guidetti’s pass from the left. A dreadful miss, but Pickford’s playing a goalkeeper who just isn’t going to concede today. 70 min: England win a corner. Trippier sends the ball into the mixer, but Sweden clear.69 min: Raheem Sterling attacks down the inside left, then attempts to pick out Harry Kane with a curling delivery across the face of goal. Granqvist intercepts, but his makes a pig’s ear of his clearance. The ball drops kindly for Dele Alli, whose volley goalwards is blocked by the Sweden captain.67 min: Sweden double-substitution: Martin Olsson and John Guidetti come on for Emil Forsberg and Ola Toivonen.66 min: The ball pinballs around the Sweden penalty area towards the end of another England attack. It breaks for Harry Maguire in a good position, but he balloons the ball high, wide and out of the stadium.63 min: With the game completely open and England in control, Sweden had a wonderful opportunity to pull a goal back there. Claesson was on hand to steer a Berg lay-off towards the bottom left-hand corner. Pickford’s save was sensational, but he steered the ball straight back into the path of Claesson. He had a second bite of the cherry, but Henderson blocked.62 min: Jordan Pickford saves brilliantly again, getting down to his right to save a low Viktor Claesson drive from about 10 yards. Jordan Henderson is on hand to block the follow-up shot when England looked certain to concede.61 min: This is shaping up to be a potential massacre as England look totally rampant against a Swedish side that appear clueless in the face of this imperialistic onslaught. Oh, hold on ...59 min: Completely unmarked at the far post, Dele Alli heads home from about five yards out after leaping to convert a Jesse Lingard cross from the right. In the Samara Arena, It’s Coming Home by Baddiel, Skinner and The Lightning Seeds blares out over the PA System. Well, that was coming. Dele Alli doubles England’s lead. 56 min: England players form a line of six in the Sweden penalty area as they wait for Trippier to send the ball in. His delivery is typically excellent, but Granqvist gets a crucial touch.56 min: England are almost totally dominant and win a corner as they turn the screw. Lingard tries a shot from distance which goes out of Krafth.55 min: Sterling canters down the right flank and sends in a cross. Sweden clear again, but are looking very shaky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0073ae6d89858ae8f28f4082fe9cf63f8314e7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4823aa293b457f603de5ae7e9c337bd8","title":"golden boot standings top scorers for russia 2018 world cup","story":"The first official Fifa World Cup award for the player to score the most goals in the competition went to Paolo Rossi in 1982.

The Golden Shoe now usually refers to the top scorer in Europe across all club competitions.The Golden Boot goes to the player credited with the most goals (not including own goals, since you ask). If there is a tie, the award goes to the player with the most assists.

The second- and third-placed players are given the Silver and Bronze Boot respectively.In 2010, Thomas Müller, David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlán were tied on five goals. Müller won on the basis of assists, with the others ranked on the basis of minutes played. This meant that Forlán, in fourth place, got nothing, and had to console himself with the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament.

As we step off the train, both of us are thinking about the casual damage that may await us after leaving the house and its contents in the care of the youngest one and the middle one for 30 hours: appliances broken, leaks sprung, supplies decimated.Outside the pub next to the station, my wife slows her step.“Do you think he’s working today?” she says. She means the youngest one.“I think he said he was,” I say.“Shall we say hello?” my wife says. It would be, of course, the last thing he’d want: an unscheduled parental drop-by at his place of employment. He would be obliged, in the circumstances, to treat us like customers.“Absolutely,” I say.The tables under the umbrellas outside are full, but the pub’s interior is dark, cool and quiet. At the far end of the room, a big-eyed urchin is hard at work behind the bar, answering the drinking needs of the alfresco clientele. “It’s still funny,” I say.“It’s true,” my wife says. “Why is it still funny?”“Because it’s so incongruous,” I say. “It’s like leaving an eagle in charge of a newsagents.”The youngest one is pouring a pint while simultaneously adding soda water to two glasses. As we approach, he looks up. His eyeballs make a brief, world-weary survey of the ceiling, then return to the pint glass in his hand. “You’re back,” he says.“Oh yes,” my wife says, settling on to a bar stool. “Have we got time for a swift half?”“I think we do,” I say. “What sort of ales do you have, barman?”He looks along the range of taps, and then back at me. “These,” he says.“Two, please,” I say.“Is the dog still alive?” my wife says.“The last time I saw the dog, it was alive,” he says, filling one glass, then another. He cocks his head in the direction of the next customer, taking another order.“He looks taller in here,” my wife says.“That’s because the floor behind the bar is six inches higher,” I say.“That’s lucky,” she says. “Otherwise, he’d have to stand on a chair to reach the taps.”“Here you go,” he says, setting down two halves without making eye contact.“This is fun,” I say.A smartly dressed 10-year-old boy approaches the bar with a menu in one hand and £30 in the other. The youngest one leans across the bar to take his order. For a moment, their heads are both bent in grave consultation. The youngest one points to something on the menu and raises his eyebrows. The boy nods sternly and hands over the notes. My wife turns towards me. “Have you seen Bugsy Malone?” she asks.“Uh-huh,” I say.Drinks finished, we head to the nearest shop to stock up on things we’re almost certainly out off: milk, beer, ice-cream. We walk the final leg of our journey home in blistering heat. “You know what?” my wife says. “Good on him.”“Yes,” I say, not quite sure who we’re talking about.“He’s had that job for nearly a year,” she says. “He works hard.”“They all work hard, when they work,” I say.“I suppose,” she says.“It’s possible all our children have discovered some latent sense of responsibility,” I say.“Really?” my wife says.“A discovery that, for obvious reasons, they prefer to conceal from us.” At the corner, I can see that our house is demonstrably not on fire.“Do you have keys?” my wife asks as we reach the step. “Mine are right at the bottom of my bag.”“We won’t be needing them,” I say.When I open the door, the dog crashes into my knees. A minute later, the middle one comes down the stairs. “Yo,” he says.“Are these yours?” I say, holding up a set of keys.“Where were they?” he says.“Sticking out of the front door.”He smiles broadly. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb7de93e391def1bbdbb3ece28cff33234b0be3/0_840_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd878fea102da0ab5e2e39a47bb9f8a8","title":"yotam ottolenghi hummus recipes","story":"Up your game by serving it on aromatic cinnamon and ginger oil, or with roast garlic and mushrooms, or even under marinated grilled quail skewersHummus gets its name from the Arabic word for “chickpea”, and traditionally it contains just chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice and garlic olive oil is used only to finish it off on the plate. Other versions, based mainly on olive oil and containing anything from beetroot to avocado, I’ve always rejected as phoney imposters, but after making today’s three wonderful chickpea spreads with not so much as a gram of tahini among them, I couldn’t help but call them anything other than, well, “hummus”.This yields enough cooked chickpeas to make two of today’s other dishes. I like the idea of having two contrasting hummus dishes in one meal, but not everyone will share that sentiment. Luckily, cooked chickpeas freeze very well just defrost them and bring back up to room temperature before using. I say to cook the chickpeas for 45 minutes, but it can take substantially longer, depending on variety and freshness, so cook them until they’re completely soft.Soak OvernightPrep 5 minCook 45 minMakes 600g250g dried chickpeas1½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSaltStart the day ahead by soaking the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda. Drain and refresh, then put in a large pot with 1.8 litres of water and half a teaspoon more of bicarb. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, lower the heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes. Add a teaspoon of salt and cook for 15 minutes more, until the chickpeas are very soft when squashed between your fingers, but still hold their shape, then drain.Grab some crusty bread or pitta to mop up the fried aromatic oil with this hummus.

Blitz for about two minutes, until you have a smooth paste (you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times).For the fried aromatics, heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium heat, then gently fry the chilli, garlic, ginger and cinnamon for five minutes, stirring every once in a while, until the garlic is just starting to brown. Add the coriander stalks and fry for a minute or two more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic. Transfer the solids to a plate with a slotted spoon (reserve the oil) and sprinkle generously with flaked salt.Spoon the hummus on to a large plate, creating a large well in the centre with the back of a spoon. Spoon the oil into the well and drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice. Top with the fried aromatics and fresh coriander, and serve.There’s a bit of work involved here, but this is a glorious dish to delight any hummus lover. Separating the quail into breasts and legs is a little tricky, so ask your butcher to do it if you’re unsure (use the carcasses for stock or gravy). Another option is to use boneless chicken thighs, and adjust the cooking time according to their size. You’ll need four long metal skewers (or wooden skewers soaked in water for 10 minutes).2 tbsp olive oil1½ tsp ground allspice1½ tbsp pomegranate molasses, plus ½ tbsp to serve1½ tbsp soy sauce1 tsp lemon zest2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp maple syrup2 thyme sprigsFlaked sea salt and black pepper4 quail (1kg), breasts taken off the bone, legs and thighs cut off in one pieceFor the parsley salsa10g parsley leaves, finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 tbsp olive oil1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get ½ tbsp, then juiced, to get 1 tbspFor the hummus300g freshly cooked chickpeas (see introduction to first recipe)½ garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp1 tbsp olive oil100g Greek-style yoghurtFlaked sea salt and black pepperMix the first eight ingredients in a large container with a teaspoon and a half of flaked salt and plenty of pepper. Put the quail in the marinade, mix everything together, then leave to marinate for two hours at room temperature (or in the fridge overnight). Thread two breasts and two legsthighs on to each skewer. Discard the thyme.Mix all the salsa ingredients with a generous pinch of flaked salt and a good grind of pepper.Put two thirds of the chickpeas in a food processor with the garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, oil, 80g yoghurt and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and blitz smooth. Transfer to a saucepan and set aside.Heat a griddle pan on a high heat until very hot. Lay in the skewers skin side down and grill for five minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown, then leave to rest for five minutes.Put the pan of chickpeas on a medium-high heat with the remaining 100g whole chickpeas and gently heat for a few minutes, until warm. Transfer to a platter with a lip and stir in the remaining 20g yoghurt, so you have streaks of yoghurt through the chickpeas.Arrange the quail skewers on top of the hummus. Spoon on the salsa, finish with a drizzle of pomegranate molasses and serve.Grilling and marinating mushrooms really enhances their meatiness, making this a hearty vegetarian option.

The tape has survived in good condition but the way we hear it now has changed significantly in the 55 years spent in limbo (in care of the family of Coltrane’s first wife, Naima, apparently). Back then, what was to come, musically, was only a possibility, partly contained by what\u0026nbspwas already there. Now we also hear what was destined to be left behind. That which had not existed is now dated: literally in the sense that we know the date, but also because it has been made to sound older by virtue of what Coltrane went on to do.There is a wonderful recording of Ben Webster rehearsing Denmark’s Radio Big Band in 1970, coaxing them in his inimitable way (“Scream it! Scream that shit!”) to swing harder. So successful is he that by the end it seems that, on the first takes of each song, they had not swung at all. Coltrane’s quartet, by contrast, come powering out of the blocks. So completely were they living within the process of music-making that they could pick things up at a moment’s notice. Straight after this session they headed off for the last night of a fortnight-long residency at\u0026nbspNew York’s Birdland. The following day they were back in\u0026nbspthe same studio to record an album with\u0026nbspsinger Johnny Hartman. The result is not likely to be high on any list of jazz essentials but it illustrates\u0026nbsphow the forward momentum of creative expression was harnessed, at this point, by a constant desire to maintain and extend the commercial success achieved a couple of years earlier by My Favorite Things.The week’s crowded schedule also highlights how much was happening for Coltrane and, by extension, in jazz generally, at this period. The timescale on which his career as a leader can be charted is painfully concentrated. In tandem with – and right after – his work with Miles Davis in the late 1950s, Coltrane recorded several albums under his own name but he did not settle on a definitive line-up for the quartet until late 1961. A Love Supreme was recorded in December\u0026nbsp1964. Seven months later came Ascension, a clamorous declaration of freedom featuring an extended ensemble that still commands awe even if listening to it is no longer the essential rite of agonised passage it once was.From the autumn of 1965 drummer Rashied Ali and the young saxophonist Pharoah Sanders (who played at Ronnie Scott’s in London last week, aged 77) swelled the regular band to a sextet. By the\u0026nbspend of the year, it had shrunk back to a quintet with the departure of Jones and Tyner (who was replaced by Coltrane’s second wife, Alice). Coltrane died on 17 July 1967 at the age of 40. Half a century later we are still measuring the effect of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspcomet streaking through our\u0026nbspworld: its light, its holiness, its kind of love – and the darkness left by its passing.In the liner notes Sonny Rollins likens the discovery of this session to “finding a new room in the great pyramid”. True, but the room turns out to be rather like a few of the surrounding ones, even containing versions of some of the same artefacts (including four stabs at Impressions, one of Coltrane’s most frequently performed compositions). With regard to the new numbers, it’s hard\u0026nbspto imagine the gorgeous melody of Untitled Original 11386 – featuring Coltrane on soprano – being played with more snap. Oh, how that melody longs for a name, to distinguish itself from the opening Untitled Original 11383! The band keep returning to the melody between solos, as if it is calling and tempting\u0026nbspthem back. What’s it saying? It’s saying, delightedly, “Call me by my name!” The more they return to it the more alluring the call becomes. It’s so different to the moment at the Isle of Wight on\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspAugust 1970 when Miles Davis is asked what music he’d been playing. “Call it anythin’,” he rasps with characteristic indifference.11386 also demonstrates how, in jazz, “pretty” – pretty notes, pretty tunes – has always been compatible with high seriousness. Same with being sentimental: Coltrane recorded In a Sentimental Mood with Duke Ellington, who famously liked “great big ol’ tears”. Of course jazz, in Coltrane’s final phase, became the opposite of pretty (any tears in it scald like molten lead) or at least part of the challenge of listening to it is in finding residual prettiness among the screech of bent metal and cosmological holler. Could there be an intimation of that here? The soprano, as Coltrane scribbles his solos, is sometimes on the brink of being irritating. It is redeemed by the quality we always associate with him: intensity. If, logically, this means that it can be intensely irritating then that might account for how joyously we are returned to the precarious sanctuary\u0026nbspof melody.The surprising highlight turns out not to be an original but a cover of Nature Boy, the song made famous by Cole Porter. It’s also the shortest track: a reminder that the musician famous for his unstoppability could sometimes achieve beauty in brevity. Alabama, a profound and historically important composition, recorded in November 1963, clocked\u0026nbspin at just five minutes. Possessed by a similar mournfulness, Nature Boy is sketched even more briefly. (The quartet will record a longer, very different version in 1965.)The last major archaeological discovery in the ongoing Coltrane dig was Offering, a live performance from 1966 released four years ago which, like much from his\u0026nbspfinal phase, tests the listener’s nerve and loyalty. “It’s all a matter,” as his near contemporary, photographer Garry Winogrand, once said, “of how much freedom you can stand.” To Jones, that freedom began to sound like “a lot of noise”. A repeated pleasure on this\u0026nbspsession is hearing Elvin setting up those complex mid-tempo grooves that he could maintain till the end of time (where,\u0026nbspin a conceptual sense, he and Trane parted company). The best way to visualise this – aside from watching\u0026nbspfootage of Jones, Tyner and Garrison themselves in full flow – is to imagine a tree in summer, moving, if such a thing is possible, in a gale-force breeze: every leaf twitching separately, all of them swaying together.Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album by John Coltrane is out now on Impulse!.

Marcus Fysh replied to May’s announcement on Twitter at 2.48am on Saturday, saying: “Please see me,” following it five minutes later with: “Moronic.”Rees-Mogg said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals but added: “This will require legislation and if, when we get the detailed legislation, it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative party’s manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.”He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he would wait to see if the red lines had “been turned pink” but warned that the common rulebook proposal could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming into the UK.He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit.“As with eggs: an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the prime minister promised.“The prime minister will, I’m sure, stick to her word – that is crucially important – but I will certainly stick to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and will not vote for something that doesn’t deliver Brexit.”Jenkyns complained that “British businesses will continue to be a rule-taker from the EU” and said she would “pray” that the detail was not as bad as she feared. There is no sign yet of how many MPs are unhappy with the common rulebook proposal, and moderate Tories have supported it. Heidi Allen said she was “pleased to report Theresa May has secured cabinet agreement for a sensible, soft Brexit”. The Democratic Unionist party deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, whose party’s votes are crucial to propping up the May government, said he would be meeting ministers to go through the details. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal. The transport secretary said: “I didn’t campaign to leave the European Union to have a different specification of motorcar on sale in the UK to the one that’s on sale in France. “This is simply saying that we will effectively sell the same products across Europe as we do now – it’s what business does and would do anyway, nobody produces a different product for one country.”Asked what the common rulebook with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Grayling told Today: “There may be inidual issues to address in future trade talks.”The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, said: “As a passionate Brexiter with huge optimism about our future as a free-trading nation, I agree with the PM that keeping the UK together is vital.”The prime minister released a statement following the critical Friday afternoon session of the long-awaited summit. May said the cabinet had “agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU”. That included a proposal to “create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products” after Brexit.Lord Ashcroft said on Saturday afternoon that he believed environment secretary Michael Gove was the first Brexiter to give the prime minister support.On Thursday, when the common rulebook proposal was first leaked, hardline Brexiter cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs had voiced alarm that it could prevent the UK striking a trade deal with the US, which has different standards in goods and foods, such as allowing chlorine-washed chicken to be sold for human consumption. But May was able to release the text of a three-page agreed statement before cabinet, following a relatively undramatic day of discussions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, appeared to react warmly to the proposals, noting in a tweet that the “Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to white paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable and realistic”. The CBI and the Institute of Directors business groups also voiced relief.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sellout. “Theresa May has betrayed us all – and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it,” he said.The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.” The prime minister made clear that she expected ministers would be sacked if they did not remain in line with her soft Brexit blueprint. She wrote to Tory MPs to explain her plans and included a clear warning about discipline: “As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their inidual views. Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.”Ministers had been told to surrender their phones in line with what was described as “standard practice for cabinet meetings” when they arrived at Chequers at about 10am on Friday with none of their advisers there, meaning that they were not able to immediately present their version of events.May had asked everybody with the right to attend cabinet to be present, a total of 29 people, meaning that a greater proportion of those present were expected to be loyal to her. Despite speculation that some ministers could stage a walkout through the Buckinghamshire countryside to the nearest train station, there was no sign of Boris Johnson or any other hard Brexiter leaving before dinner. One minister said that Johnson “was actually very big about it and by dinner spoke passionately in favour of making it work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd71bfd9ba0b33666bbd9a1424e0855bc0c3a9fa/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6ba7a2fdb6287ffa9523f8f908a6bcf","title":"soft brexit proposal welcomed both sides irish border","story":"Dublin says free trade area plan ‘deserves consideration’ as DUP endorses dealThe Irish government says Theresa May’s proposals for Brexit “deserve consideration” but has warned that much work needs to be done to get to a deal.Echoing the chief EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, the country’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said it needs to see the white paper before it can progress to negotiations. In a statement issued on Saturday, Coveney reiterated the need for a permanent backstop for the Irish border, which would provide what Ireland sees as an “insurance policy” in the event of a change of government or a no-deal scenario.“Ireland’s position is that we want to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK. On the backstop for the border, our position remains clear. “While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided,” he said. He called on the UK to step up its efforts amid warnings that there were only weeks to the October deadline for a deal.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day in and day out with the taskforce team he leads,” he said.The British Irish Chamber of Commerce warned any attempt to strike a Brexit deal for goods only would be resisted by business leaders.The group’s director general, John McGrane, said that it would be a “fudge” and unworkable. “She is working very, very hard, moving millimetre by millimetre, and to say we could end up in some customs arrangement is a good thing.“But the whole point about trade is that it is not just goods. Goods do not exist in isolation. Services include the haulage sector, the creative sector, the tech sector – services simply cannot be left behind,” he said. He also said that a goods-only deal would not remove the need for an Irish border, with the issue of freedom of movement of people across the border impacting EU citizen employees, tourism and communities. The Democratic Unionist party, which threatened to torpedo May’s December deal over the border plan, has welcomed the proposal, describing it as a “reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us”, claiming it would be bad news for “republicans” who want to break up the United Kingdom. “It is clear the whole country will leave the EU together. Republicans may be disappointed as they tried their best to seize this as an opportunity to weaken the union,” said the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. Sinn Féin has argued for a special bespoke deal for Northern Ireland.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, gave the proposal a guarded welcome.She said it showed there was “more realism” and the plan was “hopefully a step forward”.However, she said the plan for a foot in the single market for goods and not for services sounded like the very “cherry-picking” the EU had rejected. But she said the softening of red lines meant it was “game on for those who would prefer to see a full single marketcustoms union outcome”.The statement on Friday night makes it clear that May believes the proposal for a free trade area on goods and agriculture will obviate the need for infrastructure and checks at the Irish border. It said the UK would be “honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast agreement” on peace signed 20 years ago and the deal would be so deep and comprehensive the “backstop” agreed in December would “not need to be brought into effect”. Brussels has made it clear from the outset that the backstop is mandatory and without it a withdrawal agreement cannot be struck or a transition period arranged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b09d6b8c42abbbd4d4fd7c6fe468517df8ed84/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1bf0a79531f14ad329b3a0b548100d","title":"alex hales eoin morgan england india ben stokes","story":"• All-rounder fit to face India in Bristol after injury lay-off• Alex Hales’ form ‘makes him a very strong case’, says captainVictory in Cardiff on Friday means a showdown in Bristol to decide the outcome of a T20 series that has been so much more intriguing than those games against Australia. There is more needle and more quality in these matches and consequently they are a much better spectacle.Even the pre-match deliberations of the England set-up are interesting. There is a big selection dilemma to resolve before the match gets under way at 2pm on Sunday. Ben Stokes is fit to play England will be eager to rehabilitate him after another enforced absence but it is unclear how they might to do it.Eoin Morgan was suitably candid in Cardiff when asked whether he knew who would play in Bristol. “No. It’s not clear,” he said. “It’s a difficult decision to make but we will do whatever is right for the betterment of the team.”There was an assumption that Alex Hales would give way yet he was the man who calmly guided England home. “That makes him a very strong case for Bristol,” said Morgan.They could leave Joe Root out for Sunday’s game. They might fudge the issue by replacing Jake Ball with Stokes but the reason why everyone wants Stokes there is to give the captain plenty of options. It would certainly seem perverse to drop Hales just now.Hales understands the situation and does not know whether he will play. “I have no answer,” he said. “I’m doing all I can to score runs and keep putting pressure on the guys who know they’re playing.“We will have to see. If it’s me that’s left out, you look at the guys who are playing ahead of me and what can you do? It’s up to me to keep training hard, being positive and to have a decent mindset.Morgan admitted that England’s batting lineup and order is a work in progress and he hinted that they have not found the ideal solution yet. It does feel that England are not playing to their strengths by having Hales down the order, despite his success in Cardiff.The elevation of Jos Buttler is triggered by performances in the IPL rather than any deficiencies in England’s previous lineup this experiment may not last long, especially since Morgan is keen to be flexible so far from the next World Cup, in 2020.Hales is not in a position to dictate where he bats. He merely points out his eagerness to open if possible. “That’s where I enjoy batting and that’s what I’ve done my whole career. But if I’m at three, four or five it’s a role I’m happy to take on and to learn new things.”At the moment he is happy just to play. “The batting lineup is that strong. You look how well Jos is playing. He’s batting on a different planet. Just to be part of this lineup anywhere is a great effort.”Well, the competition at the moment is healthy and productive and Hales is back in the mix after being tormented by Kuldeep Yadav at Old Trafford. After that game he had a few harsh words with himself and he found a way.“I had never faced him before,” explained Hales‚ “and didn’t know much about him. Maybe I just went out at Manchester without a plan and I couldn’t get going.“I watched a bit more footage, worked with Merlyn and looked to play a bit more off the back foot and waited for him to float one up then I hit a bit straighter.”This plan worked well at Cardiff. The assumption is that he will have another opportunity to put it into practice on Sunday afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18dc5220ddd55c9ca1e31b775b45bddbcba6ae8/0_314_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c033916dfbcc7b0dc408be949c541582","title":"chris froome little sympathy boos tour de france","story":"Rider faces barrage of boos on Tour de France first stage while rivals bemoan lack of clarity over his adverse analytical findingTeam Sky have been here before at the Tour de France, and not just in the sense that the 2011 race started in the same region, the Vendée, that hosts this year’s Grand Départ. It is all familiar: the questions, the doubts, the innuendo, the attempts at spin-doctoring, the less than entirely warm welcome from the French public and press.It has become part of the furniture for the favourites at the Tour, to the extent that one French newspaper – justifiably – wondered on Saturday just how Chris Froome gets his head around it all. The team’s head, Sir Dave Brailsford, has spoken of the necessity for elite‑level sport to be an uncomfortable place to be – it keeps a team on its toes – and he has certainly achieved that with Team Sky, although in a way that has not been entirely intentional. But his close-knit band seem to thrive on the feeling that it is them against the world and there is no reason why it will not be that way yet again in the next few weeks.There was good reason to circle the wagons after the revelation on Monday that there would be no further proceedings in the case involving Froome’s high salbutamol reading at the 2017 Vuelta a España. As the team took to the stage at the pre-Tour presentation on Thursday night, in La Roche-sur-Yon, there were boos and catcalls and at least one anti-Froome poster brandished, in spite of calls for calm from voices ranging from the French favourite Romain Bardet to David Lappartient, president of the sport’s governing body, the UCI.There was limited sympathy from one rival at least: “We hope that people will avoid doing it,” said Nairo Quintana. “But sometimes you reap what you sow.” The booing, in the view of Lappartient, was a shame but related to cycling’s past and, he said, a lack of clarity: “When you don’t have clear answers, that’s always difficult.”Sky went on a PR offensive early in the week, with publication of information about Froome’s weight loss and diet regime on certain stages in the Giro d’Italia, including stage 19 to Bardonecchia, where he sealed his victory in the race. The information was termed fake news by the former Team Sky rider Richie Porte. The Australian added: “We’re all pros, we know how to fuel, we don’t need to read what Sky say they’re doing. We’ve been doing this long enough to know how to eat.”The irony of Froome calling for transparency will be lost on no one. There have been so many calls for Team Sky to tell the world about some affair or other over the years that there is an element of Groundhog Day about them. The argument has always been the same, that Sky can only benefit from transparency, given they have repeatedly committed to it, and given the 20 years of suspicion among the minds of cycling fans and media that have followed the Festina scandal of 1998.Most Tours since 2012 have included them making such appeals, the subjects different but all with the sport’s doping past as at least a subtext: the hiring of Dr Geert Leinders the team’s due diligence on Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, who tested positive for blood doping in the period before he joined Sky Froome’s cadence, Froome’s power output, therapeutic use exemptions, the parliamentary inquiry into the Jiffy bag affair.Froome was not the only one calling for more information on the case. “We’ve heard very little about the elements that led to the decision,” said Bardet, complaining of “a great opaqueness”.“It’s not very clear to everyone why he was cleared. We know there’s a full written verdict but we’ve not seen why, in detail,” added the 2014 Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, who felt there had been double standards applied compared with the case of his friend Diego Ulissi the UCI, in a press release on Friday, said it felt this was not the case.“If there’s someone to blame it’s not Froome, it’s the laxness of the rules,” said the Frenchman. “An adverse analytical finding, a positive test, this thing about thresholds – we don’t really know where we stand. That creates doubts and suspicions and I’m the first to regret that because cycling loses its\u0026nbspcredibility.”The stage is set for a game of pass the parcel with Wada, the UCI and Team Sky each claiming one of the others was responsible for making information public.The game took another turn on Friday when Lappartient stated he would be happy to publish the information but that it was dependent on Froome giving his permission. That, in turn, appeared to contradict the UCI’s own press release, stating that it understood why Wada would not release information and that it would put nothing more in the public domain.The final word on Froome should go to Nibali, who was asked by the veteran French writer Philippe Brunel for his feelings on the Froome verdict. The Italian replied that he would rather fight Froome than his shadow in other words, it is better to have Froome at the race with the affair settled than for him to be banned or awaiting the outcome. Any verdict was to be welcomed. A neat, complete ending will, as always in cycling, be harder\u0026nbspto find."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf0054f3ee58e25c9ef759e919560daa4c167aa/172_93_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=723b7facab32bc5386640a6f44ae9578","title":"england katherine brunt local hero womens odi new zealand headingley","story":"England got the three-match series against New Zealand off to the perfect start with a 142-run win on Saturday, in the first women’s ODI to be staged at Headingley.Half-centuries from Amy Jones and Heather Knight at both ends of the England innings took the home side to 290 for five – their highest ODI total against New Zealand – after they won the toss and chose to bat first. In reply New Zealand slumped to 148 in 33.5 overs, Nat Sciver and Laura Marsh chiming in with three wickets apiece.Sciver, who was the player of the match for her contribution, which included 37 runs, said: “It was a pretty good performance all round. We knew we needed to get through that middle order and make sure we were always on top. We wanted to be clinical and ruthless and we were.”For New Zealand it was the same old story, the loss of Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine in consecutive overs sparking a collapse after the pair had taken the score to 50 without loss after the first 10.Both were lucky to last as long as they did, Bates surviving a big appeal for caught behind when on 13 and Sciver putting down an easy Devine catch at midwicket, both off the bowling of the unlucky Katie George on her ODI debut.George, though, got her name in the scorebook with a wonderful ing catch at mid-off from the bowling of Sciver to send Bates back to the pavilion, only six balls after an equally brilliant snaffle by Sophie Ecclestone in the same position to see off Devine. George also wrapped up England’s clinical bowling display, trapping Holly Huddleston lbw – the last wicket to go after New Zealand lost seven wickets for only 45 runs.England’s innings had got off to a flier as Jones and Tammy Beaumont put on 111 for the first wicket, the pair punishing some short, wayward bowling from the New Zealand pace attack. Of the two, Jones was dominant, reaching her first international half-century on home soil in 56 balls while Beaumont, playing second fiddle at the other end, still had only 25 to her name.Beaumont never looked quite at home at the crease, lucky to survive an lbw shout to the 17-year-old leg-spinner Amelia Kerr which would have been hitting middle stump when on 23, and her stay was ended when she top-edged a Lea Tahuhu bouncer to Katey Martin behind the stumps on 40.Kerr, whose figures of two for 36 from 10 overs were the pick of a bowling attack that otherwise leaked runs, then worked her magic to get rid of Jones, who had looked comfortably on course for a big score, as she was stumped coming down the pitch. Four overs later Sarah Taylor departed, bamboozled by Kerr’s googly for the second time in six days, leaving England on 148 for three. Kerr followed up by bowling the only maiden of the England innings.New Zealand failed to sustain the pressure, allowing Sciver and Katherine Brunt to score at a run-a-ball as both shared half-century stands with the captain Knight – 76 runs coming from the last 10 overs. Ultimately it was Brunt’s innings which received the heartiest cheers from the 2,100-strong crowd as the Barnsley bowler-turned-all rounder slogged her way to an unbeaten 30.“It was about building partnerships and making sure that we were there for a period of time, and still remaining positive with our intent to score,” Sciver said. “The wicket got a bit slow in the middle overs so we needed to manoeuvre the ball and test the field a little bit. It’s something we work on in the nets, so why not play it in the game?”The series continues at Derby on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9284fc89d84ed46eb391e718502d25eb66711a9b/340_381_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c439fadae379a77adc628bf320969","title":"lewis hamilton british f1 gp pole sebastian vettel","story":"If ever Lewis Hamilton needed a lift, it was here, in the cauldron of qualifying for the British Grand Prix. Pushed to produce one of his best ever laps to take pole from Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who will start second, the four-times world champion once again found inspiration from the huge crowd at Silverstone. They, in turn, were rewarded with an exceptional run that the Mercedes driver ranked as one of the most testing of his career.Nigel Mansell said the home crowd at the British Grand Prix was worth up to half a second a lap to him. The 1992 champion adored his home grand prix and its fans, as does Hamilton and they were out in force for him again. Basking in glorious sunshine at the old airfield, a world away from the inhospitable cold weather and winds that often sweep across the circuit, their enthusiasm was undimmed even by the tense anticipation of England’s imminent clash with Sweden.Hamilton had gone out to a campsite on Friday night to deliver 2,000 beers and 1,000 snack boxes at his own expense for the volunteer circuit marshals and helpers, a heartfelt gesture whose good intent was returned in spades – and just as well, he needed every possible encouragement to produce his very best.Hamilton took the pole with a track record time of 1min\u0026nbsp25.892sec in a final hot lap that was a tour de force around Silverstone but he was pushed to the limit by Vettel. The German was quickest on his first run in Q3, just five-hundredths of a second in front of Hamilton. Both laps were impressive but Vettel had the edge through the middle sector. But on the final runs Hamilton was extraordinary under immense pressure, threading the needle through Maggots and Becketts with precision, he finished four-hundredths ahead of Vettel, with Kimi Räikkönen in third and Valtteri Bottas in fourth.“It felt like one of the best laps I have been able to produce,” he said. “It felt like the most pressurised lap that I have ever had. I was shaking afterwards through the emotion and the adrenaline rush, way above what I have experienced before. Which is crazy as this is my 76th pole but this 76th is so special.”Mercedes had expected to be strong at the circuit, especially using the thinner-tread tyres that their car favours. They dominated on this Pirelli rubber in both Spain and France but Ferrari came at them with\u0026nbspvenom.Hamilton recognised this, although understandably he could not wait to escape the post qualifying press conference, his excitement visible when he received news of England’s first goal. “It took everything to get it,” he said. “The fans were there I could see them, and I knew they were there, I really wanted to do it and with the pole give a boost to England. Start the wave and let them continue it.” The football team did indeed carry on the day of sporting success.Having been frustrated at the last round with a DNF, his 14-point championship lead over Vettel became a one-point deficit to the German and he will be eager to once more top the table with a win on Sunday but is taking nothing for granted. “It’ll be demanding with the heat, the speed we have through corners, the G-force we are pulling,” he said. “I definitely think it will be physically tougher and more intense, it is not going to be a case of opening a big gap, it is going to be close all the way.”Thus far, however, it is the perfect start. He has matched Ayrton Senna’s record of six poles at his home grand prix and now has the chance to again enter the history books. If he can convert it into a win it will be his fifth consecutive victory at the British Grand Prix, surpassing Jim Clark’s run of four, and he will become only the second driver to have scored five wins in a row at the same track, matching Senna’s run at Monaco between 1989 and 1993. A sixth win at the British Grand Prix would also make him the most successful competitor at the race, with one more that Clark and Alain Prost.These details, though, will not concern him until the serious business is concluded. Hamilton has been enthusiastically following England’s progress in Russia and will go to Moscow should they make the final. Having been able to enjoy watching England’s win, he will now need to refocus on what is likely to be highly competitive race. A challenge awaits but one he can face buoyed by the enthusiasm that will doubtless be once again flowing from the grandstands.For the once-mighty British team Williams, who are enduring a shocking season, there was no respite at their home race with a car that still looks a handful. Lance Stroll went off at Brooklands in Q1, ending his session and he finished in 19th. While Sergey Sirotkin also went off at Stowe and although he continued, managed only 18th place.McLaren, who are also enduring the least successful period in their history, entered their home grand prix having announced a considerable restructuring after the resignation of their sporting director Eric Boullier on Tuesday but for the moment they are mired toward the back of the midfield with Fernando Alonso in 13th and Stoffel Vandoorne in 17th place.The Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were fifth and sixth. Haas were once again the best of the rest with Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in seventh and eighth respectively. Charles Leclerc was once again strong for Sauber, taking ninth place and Esteban Ocon was in 10th for Force India.Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was 11th in front of the Force India of Sergio Pérez. Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly was 14th, Marcus Ericsson in the Sauber 15th and the Renault of Carlos Sainz 16th.Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley did not take part in qualifying after he suffered a high-speed accident in the final practice session. A suspension failure caused the New Zealander to go off and he took a major impact into the barriers at turn six. Hartley was unhurt but will start from the back of the grid or potentially the pitlane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac9c72b6f6f47b7ddc23f05d4f40b47907d5b9e/256_63_1576_946/master/1576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c4009d6c05b7c79d6a61dabebb3613","title":"james martin american adventure fiona sturges","story":"‘His final dish is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob, fully basted in sweat and despair’“Howdy guys and girls, welcome to Texas,” says the TV chef James Martin, entirely without conviction, from behind the wheel of a massive pick-up truck. It’s the third week of James Martin’s American Adventure (Friday, 8pm, ITV), which sees our host engaged in an uphill battle to convince viewers he’s enjoying himself. So far, there have been sunbaked sojourns around Napa Valley and Santa Monica, bringing with them alfresco cookery, flash wheels, too-tight trousers and a nasty case of sunburn. Next stop is San Antonio, Texas, where, says our hatchet-faced host, “the bustling Mexican vibe brings the place alive”. Martin, though, is dead inside. While the background music is pure mariachi fiesta, his expression screams: “Someone call my agent. When will this nightmare be over?”We shouldn’t be surprised. There’s nothing that’s not awkward about Martin. He spent 10 years intermittently setting fire to stuff on Saturday Kitchen – which, in retrospect, looks less like a series of culinary cock-ups than a cry for help. Had he lifted a saucepan lid one day to reveal his producer’s head bubbling away with a bouquet garni, few would have been surprised.But, having recently hightailed it to ITV, Martin has now landed what many would see as the ultimate prize – a cooking show-cum-travelogue that allows him to eat his way across entire countries and hobnob with some of the best chefs in the world. It’s a typical reward for long-serving TV chefs and foodies as they slide inexorably towards midlife crisis (see also The Hairy Bikers’ Mediterranean Adventure, Jamie’s Great Escape, and every Rick Stein show ever made). But away from the demands of live television, and thousands of miles from home, Martin is struggling to work up an appetite.“We’re not built for extreme heat in Yorkshire,” he says plaintively from behind his workstation in San Antonio’s Market Square, damp patches spreading across his shirt. It’s hotter than Satan’s bum crack here, though producers have nonetheless seen fit to park him in front of a giant\u0026nbspbarbecue in order to work his magic on a slab of salmon. Rather than being offered something useful like an electric fan, he’s given a fresh shirt and a miniature bottle of tequila and left to sweat it out in front of the nation.Elsewhere, along with a cursory two-minute history of the city, we get shots of Martin driving down a highway in his pick-up, Martin rocking a sombrero, and Martin, by now resembling a belligerent radish, scouring San Antonio for some\u0026nbspair-con. For penetrating insight into Tex-Mex culture, this is up there with Looney Tunes’ Speedy Gonzalez. His final dish, once again cooked out in the square, is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob. Fully basted in sweat and despair, Martin can barely string a sentence together. After accidentally setting fire to the corn husks and splattering his already soaked shirt in fat, he whacks the steak on a plate, glowers at the camera, turns on his heels and walks away. Martin may know about food, but lighting up the\u0026nbspscreen with his wit and charisma apparently isn’t in his job description. Someone get the man a beer and a ticket home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas.

But PUC also admits black and underprivileged students under a quota system expanded by the leftist presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff.For some of these young people, Martins is not just a writer he’s an inspirational star whose stories about life in Rio’s favelas have given voice to their reality. Journalism student Lucas França, 21, who grew up on the poorer edges of Rio’s urban sprawl, asked Martins how he felt about becoming a role model for people like him. Cinema student Gabriel Galvão, 21, said Martins’s book, The Sun on My Head, “legitimises the life experiences of a big part of the population”.Martins’s exhilarating collection of 13 short stories was a hit in Brazil before it was even published in March. Film rights were quickly snapped up, and the book will be published in the UK by Faber \u0026amp Faber next year. Its success has transformed the life of this unassuming young writer, 26, a former tennis ballboy and painter’s assistant who has become an unexpected literary sensation.With long curls tumbling down his T-shirt, a languid intelligence and a gentle smile, he is an unusual literary phenomenon for Brazil. That is because Martins grew up in Rio’s favelas – which meant, he told his audience, he had had to set his bar high. “I knew I would have to be better than the average,” he said. “I didn’t have any formal study I wrote it off my own bat.”He learned to read with his grandmother, who told him family stories and was inspired by the storytellers on the streets where he grew up. As a teenager, he developed a natural writer’s curiosity about what would happen to people around him when they grew up.“I went crazy about how every human being is a unique story and the possibilities this gave me as a writer,” he said. He was discovered at FLUP, a literary festival in low-income communities, and persuaded his mother – a cook who bought him a Remington typewriter – to let him live at home so he could write. He told her his book would launch his career – and it did exactly that.“I was very happy it worked out this way,” he said, rolling a cigarette. “Making literature is very involved with affection.”In the hands of a lesser writer, stories like Rolézim – about young men going to the beach and being harassed by police – and Travessia – in which a low-ranking drug gang member drives the body of a man he has just killed to a dump – could be grim and relentless. But Martins turns them into tense, colourful snapshots of the life in these bustling communities, with their heavily armed drug gangs, police oppression and relentless poverty.He riddles his phrases with favela slang, freestyling into hazy existential monologues when his characters succeed in scoring marijuana – a constant preoccupation in the city he describes. Clara Capitão, his Portuguese editor, compared him to Irvine Welsh, whose 1990s bestseller Trainspotting also featured working-class youth taking drugs and uncompromising vernacular.But while Welsh was hailed for his originality, playing fast and loose with grammar in Portuguese is heresy for Brazil’s deeply conservative middle classes, who believe that the ability to use the language’s complicated grammar correctly is a sign of intelligence rather than one of an expensive education. Tellingly, in Portuguese, the word educação means both “education” and “good manners”.A row erupted on a Facebook page for parents of students at a leading Rio high school after a teacher recommended The Sun on My Head – and some parents raged over its potential impact on their offspring. In a review for Rio’s staid O Globo newspaper, writer Juliana Cunha sniffed that one story in Martins’s “above average” book suffered from language a little “cluttered” for anyone not from a favela. Another critic, Eder Alex, described the book as “literal”, “obvious” and overrated on the A Escotilha site.Martins shrugged off such concerns. “It is a book full of aesthetic pretension,” he said, “but at the same time it’s a book that is very much on the street.”Although he has no university education, Martins said the quota system like the one in place at PUC has helped a new generation from Brazil’s lower classes muscle into the country’s intellectual debate – people like his friend, Djamila Ribeiro, who was raised in a working-class family in Santos and has become a celebrated academic, feminist writer and television presenter.“The market is getting interested in these new voices,” he said. “I can see a really big change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb2700488f1062a153df4813f112b33da49b51cd/0_206_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596790cd1215a698db89c4ac54114ac7","title":"north korea calls us denuclearisation talks regrettable","story":"Pyongyang says Washington is betraying spirit of historic Trump-Kim summit with demands on complete denuclearization North Korea has said that high-level talks with a US delegation led by Mike Pompeo were regrettable and accused Washington of trying to unilaterally pressurise the country into abandoning its nuclear weapons.The North’s statement came on Saturday, hours after the US secretary of state wrapped up two days of talks with senior North Korean officials without meeting Kim Jong-un but with commitments for new discussions on denuclearisation and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean war.Before leaving Pyongyang, Pompeo told reporters that his conversations with senior North Korean official Kim Yong-chol had been productive, conducted in good faith and that a great deal of progress had been made in some areas. He stressed there was still more work to be done in other areas, much of which would be done by working groups that the two sides had set up to deal with specific issues.The North provided a much harsher assessment of the talks. In a statement released by an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman, Pyongyang accused the US of betraying the spirit of last month’s summit between Donald Trump and Kim by making “one-sided and gangster-like” demands on “CVID” – the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.It said the outcome of the follow-up talks was very concerning because it had led to a “dangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm”.“We had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders’ summit … we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures,” said the statement, carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.According to the spokesman, during the talks with Pompeo, North Korea raised the issue of a possible declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which concluded with an armistice and not a peace treaty. It also offered to discuss the closure of a missile engine test site that would “physically affirm” a move to halt the production of intercontinental range ballistic missiles and setting up working-level discussions for the return of US war remains.However, the spokesman said the US had come up with a variety of “conditions and excuses” to delay a declaration on ending the war. The spokesman also downplayed the significance of the US suspending its military exercises with South Korea, saying the North had made a larger concession by blowing up the tunnels at its nuclear test site.In criticising the talks with Pompeo, however, North Korea carefully avoided attacking Trump, saying “we wholly maintain our trust toward President Trump,” but also that Washington must not allow “headwinds” against the “wills of the leaders”.Pompeo said a Pentagon team would be meeting North Korean officials on or about 12 July at the border between North and South Korea to discuss the repatriation of remains and that working-level talks would be held soon on the destruction of North Korea’s missile engine testing facility.In the days following his historic 12 June summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, Trump had announced that the return of the remains and the destruction of the missile facility had been completed or were in progress. Pompeo, however, said more talks were needed on both.Earlier, Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol both said they needed clarity on the parameters of an agreement to denuclearise the Korean peninsula that Trump and the North Korean leader had agreed to in Singapore. The trip was Pompeo’s third to Pyongyang since April and his first since the summit.Unlike his previous visits, which have been one-day affairs during which he has met Kim Jong-un, Pompeo spent the night at a government guesthouse in Pyongyang and did not see the North Korean leader, although US officials had suggested such a meeting was expected.

The latest casualties are three children from eastern Ghazni province who were killed by roadside mines at the weekend.With two rounds of high-stakes elections due within the next year, political tensions are adding to concerns about rising insecurity. Parliamentary elections are due to take place in October. Next spring there will be a presidential vote, with the current leader, Ashraf Ghani, expected to run for re-election.Power brokers and the many ethnic strongmen who carved out a constituency over decades of war are now manoeuvring to bolster their position before the polls. One of the biggest question marks hangs over the exiled vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum. He fled to Turkey last year after allegations he ordered the torture and sexual assault of a political opponent. An ethnic Uzbek, Dostum still holds huge sway among his community in Afghanistan, and there are regular rumours he will return. His supporters took to the streets this week in northern Faryab province, for sometimes violent protests over the government’s arrest of a prominent militia commander who is one of Dostum’s allies.“Until the last drop of our blood we will try and fight to get justice, which is the releasing of our commander and the returning of our general,” said one supporter who had travelled from an outlying district.This year has been a particularly bloody one in Afghanistan, especially in the cities where one of the worst waves of violence in decades killed hundreds. The dead included nine journalists, killed along with at least seven other people by a suicide bomber posing as one of the press corps.There was a respite at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when Ghani offered the Taliban a unilateral ceasefire as a precursor to possible talks. For three days over Eid the militant group responded by putting down their weapons.The rare days without conflict sparked celebrations and a sense of possibility, alongside a sense of hope that many Afghans had all but abandoned. Taliban soldiers wandered into towns they had attacked for years, where they took grinning selfies with the army and officials who are normally their targets.“I am 24, and in these years the only thing that I can remember is war and war and war, but during Eid days I saw some moments of joy that I did not see in my entire life,” said Firooz Osmani, a resident of Gozara district in western Herat province. “I cried when I saw Taliban and government officials are hugging and taking selfies, I could not stop my tears. I was really disappointed when I understand that the truce is over.”Pro-government Afghans who had felt confined to those cities are returning to home villages after long absences. But Taliban commanders were reportedly furious about the impromptu socialising, and worried that the success of the ceasefire could undermine morale.Although the government stuck to its own ceasefire for 18 days, the Taliban went back to fighting after three days. There were also attacks by the regional branch of Islamic State, which never agreed to put down their weapons.Among the areas where officials now say they feel under siege is eastern Ghazni province. “The province is facing very bad days. If the central government do not send extra forces for help, we will witness a catastrophe in the entire province,” said Nasir Ahmad Faghiri, a member of the provincial council in Ghazni."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809417b64e8b2fcb902cbcace17efdca643d59c2/7_510_3913_2349/master/3913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f38f1c665d5ccc86af82144824a2ad","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent recall of frozen vegetables from irish supermarkets","story":"The Food Safety Authority of Ireland\u0026nbsp(FSAI) has issued an urgent recall of frozen vegetables from a number of Irish supermarkets over listeria fears.The authority has recalled 18 products from Tesco, Lidl, Iceland and Brakes stories nationwide.

By the time it ended, the three-month heatwave had caused the worst drought in 150 years, while the temperature recorded in Boora on July 29th marked the fifth day in a row when the mercury had breached 32 degrees.The summer drought was heightened by the lack of rainfall during the previous two winters, which placed extraordinary demands on supplies and led to restrictions being put in place a year later to rebuild stocks.Reporting on the heatwave, The  noted the changes in people’s habits that began to be noticed throughout June, as people grew more accustomed to the new Mediterranean climate. In Ireland, on June 29th, people mulled buying shutters for windows to let the air in, and keep the sun out as temperatures hit 27.5 degrees in the Midlands and 26 degrees at Armagh Observatory – the warmest June day there since 1870. Despite the endless sunshine, RTÉ’s Colm Connolly reported the concerns on July 2nd of a consultant dermatologist about people who were taking photo-sensitising drugs to boost tanning speeds.Meanwhile, drought-sensitive beech trees suffered badly, and the growth of many of them in Ireland and the UK still showed after-effects three decades later, though ones in the UK suffered worst.Sales on electric fans continued to rise while some families opted to stay indoors completely and cool off in “tepid baths”, though the authorities urged people to keep levels below five inches.Meanwhile, The  pondered about the effects of the heatwave on men’s sexual interest, fearing that the high temperatures were causing “a love drought”. “It seems the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak when temperatures soar into the 80 and 90s,” the newspaper reported, before interviewing a clinical psychologist who explained that men still felt “sexually aroused but don’t feel inclined to initiate any activity”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Joe O\u0026rsquoCallaghan found dead in a pool of blood by his wife in Cork city on MondayProtest hears of \u0026lsquooutdated\u0026rsquo psychiatric care for trans and non-binary peopleTeenage boy was treated for head injuries at Beaumont hospital but died on SaturdayTeenager leaves other patients cut from flying glass as he smashes up bathroom\u0026lsquoForest fire tourists\u0026rsquo asked to stay away as firefighting continues on large swathes of landTaoiseach says he looks forward to seeing detailed proposals for future future EU-UK relationshipGovernment opens scheme to adjoining institutions after Ombudsman\u0026rsquos interventionWater sources are diminishing as Met \u0026Eacuteireann says drought could last for 15 more daysMan (59) pronounced dead at scene despite efforts by paramedics to resuscitate himThe Food Safety Authority of Ireland also recalls pestos over salmonella concernsCar in which dead man was a passenger left the road at Gibbstown early on SaturdayIncident took place at junction of John Street and The Manor at early on SaturdayAs they close in on a World Cup final, English expats expect colourful \u0026lsquosupport\u0026rsquo from the nativesNew interactive resource shows the city\u0026rsquos social and economic isions in stark detailData brings together sales prices, rents, locations, social housing and private rented levelsGalway woman Lorraine Walsh says cancer testing saved her life but let her down deeplyPatient representatives in Government review of cancer screening call for actionGsoc process not as advanced by time of Sgt Michael Galvin\u0026rsquos death as previously thoughtCardinal Kevin Farrell says priests have no credibility when it comes to training people for marriageLaw enforcement and safety groups have set September 19th as \u0026ldquoEuropean day without a road death"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3557850.1530961377!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave irish water looking at options for new restrictions","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Vartry Reservoir water treatment works in Co Wicklow.

Photograph: Reuters With Ireland’s exceptional warm spell showing no sign of abating and no significant let up in the drought expected for at least 15 days, Irish Water is examining options for more extensive water restrictions if required.According to Met Éireann, mainly dry, warm weather will continue this weekend and until Thursday at least, while forecaster Evelyn Cusack said predictions are for the dry spell to continue for another ten days - and possibly up to 15 days.Temperatures this weekend will range up to 26 degrees on Saturday and 28 degrees on Sunday. Ireland offically entered a drought on Thursday following 15 days without rain.Given the low-moisture content in soil following weeks without rain forecasters predict at least one week of sustained rainfall is necessary before water levels in lakes, rivers and reservoirs start to recover.An Irish Water spokeswoman said the possibility of no rain falling in the near future could lead to restrictions, which include a national hosepipe ban and night-time pressure reductions,\u0026nbspbeing extended to the commercial sector with bans on washing down premises.If these measures also proved insufficient then Irish Water would have to consider wider reductions in water pressure.The utility could theoretically ban all non essential usage, including watering can usage, window washing and watering of sports pitches.Irish Water’s helpline has received less than 40 reports of people defying the domestic hosepipe by Thursday last, the evening before the Dublin based ban was extended to all areas. The spokeswoman said further analysis of the reports would be available over coming days.Defying the ban can attract a fine of up to €125, but the spokeswoman said the majority of calls have been from people seeking clarification or advice on restrictions and outages. She said people could see the effects of the water shortage in the burnt grass and most people were behaving responsibly.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time during the week Met Éireann’s Ms Cusack said: “Our predictions are certainly another ten days which is the medium range of our forecast but we’re currently using an experimental 15 day forecast and that is indicating a lot of dry weather.“It’s been exceptionally dry. It’s been the driest June in Leinster since 1941. “These conditions will remain for another week to two weeks. It’s not only been exceptionally dry but also exceptionally sunny and that’s because the weather has been coming down from the north.”Meanwhile Irish Water has been notified of a number of ongoing leaks in Dublin City Centre in which water is flowing down the road.On Friday as the State-wide hosepipe ban came into effect water could be seen flowing down the road in front of Leinster House on Kildare Street.Irish Water has also acknowledged a report of a leak at Glover’s Lane, beside the entrance to St Stephen’s Green Car Park which has been pouring water into the street since mid June.It is understood that Irish water would have to close the road to fix the leak, leading to access issues for the centre and local business."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3557877.1530971951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may speak after pm secures approval for soft brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar meeting with British prime minister Theresa May in June.

While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.Mr Coveney said talks needed to be intensified.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day-in and day-out with the Task Force team he leads. Our entire focus now is on ensuring a Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish backstop, is agreed. This will give businesses across our islands certainty in terms of planning for a status-quo transition when the UK leaves the Union in March 2019,” he said.Mr Coveney said the UK statement needed “detailed consideration” and looked forward to the additional details the White Paper would give.Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU have been deadlocked on the issue of the Border backstop, with Brussels saying it must apply only to the North and London calling for a UK-wide solution to avoid creating barriers within the UK.In a statement issued late on Friday, the Irish Government said that EU ministers would consider the UK proposals at a meeting in Brussels on July 20th.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This is the latest humiliation, said one person on the list.Presenters are resigned to the fact that the BBC has effectively launched a National Trolling Festival where we all get pummelled over our salaries. Everyone is totally exasperated and fed up about it, managers and presenters.Transparency will effectively lead to a rate card where they \u0027pay the chair\u0027 instead of the presenter.Another broadcaster resigned to the disclosures said: Of course I\u0027d rather the world didn\u0027t know how much I get paid. It\u0027s very un-British, isn\u0027t it? But this is where we are now.Others believe it is a positive change. Look, if you\u0027re earning over £150,000, just shut up about any \u0027humiliation\u0027. Total transparency is key, said one.However, the list will be a long way from total transparency. Around one-third of the names disclosed last year will no longer be present - not because they have had their pay cut, but because their programmes are made by BBC Studios, which was spun off as a commercial entity at the beginning of the last financial year.That has created a loophole which means presenters\u0027 pay is routed through what is now classed an independent production company, meaning it no longer comes to them directly from the licence fee so does not have to be declared.The 17 actors who are paid over £150,000 for their roles on Casualty, Holby City and EastEnders will disappear from the list. The BBC\u0027s highest-paid actor is Casualty\u0027s Derek Thompson, who last year earned £350,000-399,999.Strictly Come Dancing salaries will also become secret, hiding the pay of presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, and judges Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas. Winkleman was the highest-paid woman on the list last year with a salary of £450,000-499,999.That included money from her weekly Radio 2 show. Other presenters whose shows fall within the loophole include Alex Jones (The One Show), Matt Baker (The One Show and Countryfile), Nick Knowles (DIY SOS), and Paul Martin (Flog It!).The secrecy allows for entertainment presenters and actors employed via BBC Studios to have their pay increased without it becoming public knowledge.Some broadcasters with a portfolio of shows will appear to fall down the salary league table, but only because part of their earnings are now off the books. For example, Fiona Bruce\u0027s salary for anchoring BBC One news bulletins will remain public, but her salary for Antiques Roadshow will not.Fiona Bruce\u0026#39s salary for anchoring BBC One news bulletins will remain public, but her salary for Antiques Roadshow will notThe BBC declined to confirm the new salary banding ahead of Wednesday\u0027s report, but a spokesman said: The BBC leads the way in transparency, is the only media organisation to release this data, and this year people will see we\u0027ll go even further in the information we publish.BBC Studios is now a commercial operation not underpinned by the licence fee so, just like the independent production companies it competes for business with, it isn\u0027t required to disclose salaries.First Wives Club left with \u0026#39next to nothing\u0026#39 seek perjury charges against husbands and associatesBrighton Beach erupts in a sea of jubilation and lager as England reach the semi-finalsSalisbury poisonings: Police officer admitted to hospital as \u0026#39precautionary measure\u0026#39 Comment: As we prepare to leave the EU, we must contemplate the possibility of our lights going outHostility and anger towards church on social media is stopping abuse survivors coming forward, vicar warns \u0026#39I can now go to my grave happy\u0026#39: England fans in rapturesWoman who accused Justin Trudeau of groping her breaks silenceIran executes eight over 2017 Isil terror attack on TehranFans leave Wimbledon in droves to watch England match in pubs down the road Donald Trump uses ‘Apprentice style’ approach to find his ideal ‘all-American’ Supreme Court nomineeSouth Korean women turn out in their thousands to protest against widespread spycam porn crimesLetters from Thai cave: Football coach apologises while boys request birthday party and fried chickenUS asks for more time to reunite migrant families because some parents have already been deported Warning over Chinese lanterns after star horse set on fireAt least 38 dead as record Japan rains prompt mass evacuationsWhite storks to breed in Britain for the first time in 600 yearsNorth Korea says talks with Mike Pompeo were \u0026#39regrettable\u0026#39India should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/07/TELEMMGLPICT000168702537_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqscKuyqQp6IXRzod7hjCu_onggvhOBiyVtawWCVrtjlQ.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"can now go grave happy fans home russia raptures england reaches","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFrom Brighton beach to the stands in Samara, England supporters are rejoicingdigitalservices@telegraphFootball might just be coming home.

Another excellent win to make the whole country proud.The Prime Minister also hinted that the boycott on ministers and royals attending the World Cup in Russia could be eased if England make the final.Asked whether the position could change she said we take this every game at a time but the Government had been very clear about why the decision was taken.England reach a World Cup semi-final for the first time in 28 years | Robert Mendick, Chief Reporter, in SamaraEngland had been comfortable after a headed goal that settled nerves in the 31st minutes by Leicester City’s Harry Maguire, a hitherto near unknown footballer who is rapidly becoming the housewives’ favourite.Britain’s deputy ambassador Lindsay Skoll, a 47-year-old mother had already declared that she “loves Harry Maguire” and his “boyish” looks.The game was sealed with another headed goal from Alli after 58 minutes while in between Pickford, the penalty hero from the game against Colombia, made four spectacular saves in front of a 45,000 crowd.England supporters in London Back in England, the nation sweltered and swooned in near record temperatures, enjoying pre and post game barbecues that had seen supermarket sales rocket and roads emptied by kickoff.For the first time in this World Cup, England fans outnumbered the opposition supporters, by about three-to-one, outsinging and outchanting them too.For an hour afterwards, they stood in the stands singing “we don\u0027t want to go home”. Supporters had dreaded coming to Russia, fearful of violence and with relations between the countries at a new low after the nerve agent attack on a Russian spy in Salisbury in March. Now fans don’t want to leave.“This is the biggest victory since \u002766. I say that because I have never been to a semi or a final,” said Darren Hurst, 54, a council sweeper, of Derby, It is football heaven. My dad Les, who died three years ago from cancer, told me all about the 1966 final and I can now go to my grave happy that we have got all the way to a semi-final. I really do think we are going to do it this time.England fans enjoy the pre match atmosphere in Samara Roy Hallett, 53, a railway worker who had made a 48-hour dash to Samara with his 25-year-old son. “This was more enjoyable than usual. We bought four beers at half time to celebrate. I know it was a bit early but you’ve got to do it sometimes.”Mick Hall, 62, a manager from Grimsby, couldn’t believe it: “Twenty-eight years ago I was watching on TV, now I\u0027m here for it. All the guys in the local pub will be singing for us.”Matt Pooley, 44, who works in finance in London, cried on the final whistle. “It felt appropriate to cry for getting to the semifinal for the first time in 28 years,” he said.His friend Geoff Gibbs, 54, said: “It was an impassioned performance, we knew what we needed to do and we did it.”The pair were interrupted by a group of Russian fans who wanted to take selfies with them and their England flags. “In Russia we love!” one cried. “This is history!” said another.“This is history. Tonight you\u0027ll make history!” Mr Pooley responded.Football mad bride Nadine Hanlon reacts after England score in the FIFA World Cup 2018 quarter-final match between Sweden and EnglandImmediately after the match, fans were thinking how to get tickets to the semifinal in Moscow. Tim Payton, 44, a consultant from London, was hurrying to the other side of the stadium to try to buy tickets off departing Sweden fans.Bookmakers made England 5-2 second favourites, down from 18-1 at the start of the tournament, to lift the World Cup behind France. A record amount was bet on an England game although bookies will have recouped some with captain Harry Kane failing to score for the first time in the tournament.The television audience on BBC was estimated at 30 million although the corporation’s iPlayer, which allows games to be watched almost as live, broke down with two minutes to go, spoiling the opportunity for some fans to cheer at the final whistle. Wednesday’s semi final at 7pm in Moscow will likely break all records.About 10,000 fans are now expected to travel to Moscow in the hope of obtaining a ticket for the semi-final although prices will rocket in a thriving black market.England\u0026#39s Harry Maguire shouts as he celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the quarterfinal match between Sweden and England British Airways reported a 700 per cent surge in searches for flights to Russia since the win over Colombia on Tuesday.At half time National Grid saw a spike in electricity of 1,000 megawatts - equivalent to 46 million fridge doors being opened simultaneously. By the final whistle, electricity consumption surged by 1,400 megawatts as the nation brewed up a much needed cup of tea.Fans are already confident of getting to the final, England having ended up in the easier section of the draw. On Twitter, an image went viral showing a mocked up picture of Southgate carrying a flat-pack box from Ikea, the Swedish company,  with “trophy cabinet” emblazoned on it.The result had been predicted by Neil Rowe, a British Airways pilot from London, who has started dressing in Southgate’s Marks and Spencer suit as he watches from the ground. Television cameras captured the Southgate lookalike being congratulated at half time. Wearing a blue waistcoat, slim trousers and a closely-cropped beard, Mr Rowe had predicted the win.Please review our commenting policyFirst Wives Club left with \u0026#39next to nothing\u0026#39 seek perjury charges against husbands and associatesBrighton Beach erupts in a sea of jubilation and lager as England reach the semi-finalsSalisbury poisonings: Police officer admitted to hospital as \u0026#39precautionary measure\u0026#39 Comment: As we prepare to leave the EU, we must contemplate the possibility of our lights going outHostility and anger towards church on social media is stopping abuse survivors coming forward, vicar warns BBC stars say broadcaster is \u0026#39humiliating\u0026#39 them as it plans to publish salaries in £10k bandsWoman who accused Justin Trudeau of groping her breaks silenceIran executes eight over 2017 Isil terror attack on TehranFans leave Wimbledon in droves to watch England match in pubs down the road Donald Trump uses ‘Apprentice style’ approach to find his ideal ‘all-American’ Supreme Court nomineeSouth Korean women turn out in their thousands to protest against widespread spycam porn crimesLetters from Thai cave: Football coach apologises while boys request birthday party and fried chickenUS asks for more time to reunite migrant families because some parents have already been deported Warning over Chinese lanterns after star horse set on fireAt least 38 dead as record Japan rains prompt mass evacuationsWhite storks to breed in Britain for the first time in 600 yearsNorth Korea says talks with Mike Pompeo were \u0026#39regrettable\u0026#39India should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtEU gambit to use European Investment Bank funds to shore up Iran deal is \u0026#39purely symbolic\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2018/03/05/TELEMMGLPICT000004072769_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVHzyo7OuTI5InyeNX_T1jAlDx5d2psMPAxqkfjsHOko.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"england has indulged underdog complex centuries now must shake","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFrom Rorke\u0026#39s Drift to Agincourt, British identity is anchored in tales of fighting against the oddsWe like to play the underdog, but our footballers have found a pluck our politicians lackWhat a wonderful thing it is to be an underdog!

If I get out, please can you bring me some grilled pork and vegetables?” the 15-year-old wrote. He and the other 11 trapped boys wrote the letters in the darkness of the cave, which were then delivered to their parents by Thai Navy Seal ers. The short notes, written on scraps of paper, were the first communication the anxious parents have had from their children since they disappeared on June 23.  I am so happy to see his letter, his handwriting. I\u0027m almost crying, said Supaluk Sompiengjai, the mother of one of the boys.It doesn\u0027t matter how long I wait as long as he is safe.Thai authorities said Saturday that conditions for a rescue were “perfect” over the next to three to four days, before fresh rainfall or shrinking oxygen supplies endanger the mission. Combination of photos shows handwritten messages written by boys and football coach trapped in Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai“In the next three or four days, the conditions are perfect in terms of the water, the weather and the boys\u0027 health,” said Narongsak Osottanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai Province.We have to make a clear decision on what we can do… We’re still at war with water and time.”Rescue crews have been working around the clock to pump water out the 2.5-mile tunnel between that separates the boys and their football coach from the entrance to the cave. While water levels have fallen significantly, the tunnel still contains treacherous pools and jagged rocks that would be a challenge for even professional ers, let alone a dozen exhausted teenagers. By Saturday evening, pouring rain began to once again pound the area around the cave\u0027s entrance, raising fears that the tunnel would flood once again. Rising water levels could delay a rescue effort - or force authorities to launch it sooner than they had planned to try to get in before the tunnel floods. There were chaotic scenes at the rescue camp yesterday (SAT) as a car fell off a cliff at Pha Mee hill, causing minor injuries to three people.Mr Osottanakorn said he was also worried that oxygen levels inside the cave would fall and carbon dioxide levels would rise, making the boys drowsy and eventually unconscious. The most direct method of rescue would be for the boys to swim out of the cave wearing scuba gear and accompanied by navy ers. The boys are already being given instructions in ing techniques.But the journey could take more than ten hours. The death of a Thai Navy Seal in the tunnel this week highlights how dangerous it is. More than 100 “chimneys” have also been drilled into the the mountainside, in the hope that rescuers can penetrate the cave and lift the boys out to safety. Mr Osottanakorn said the boys were 600 metres below the surface and digging crews “still cannot find their location yet”. The deepest chimney so far has reached 400 metres.Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, said Saturday that he was in discussions about an “escape pod design that might be safe enough to try” to bring the boys out of the tunnel.  Diving cylinders are prepared at a makeshift camp at the entrance of Tham Luang Nang Non cavesEkapol Chanthawong, the 25-year-old coach of the Wild Boars soccer team, wrote his own letter from the cave in which he apologised to the parents. “I promise I will care for the kids as best as possible. I want to say thanks for all the support and I want to apologise to the parents,” he wrote. His note was written in response to a joint letter from the parents of the 12 boys.  Thailand cave rescue, in pictures“Please take care of all the children. Don\u0027t blame yourself, their letter to him read. We are not mad at you at all. We understand and are rooting for you.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The south and central areas are likely to continue with the higher 20s."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/fans-985325.jpg","title":"england sweden score world cup quarter final bbc live stream","story":"SWNSEngland fans will be glued to TVs, laptops and mobiles for the big matchThe delay means millions of England fans unable to watch the game on television risk overhearing the cheers or groans from neighbours in response to action they have not yet seen.During England\u0026rsquos last match, most people were already celebrating England\u0026rsquos penalty shootout victory before those watching livestreams had seen Eric Dier walk up to take his winning kick.BBC Sport product team leader Neil Hall said said he expected record numbers of people to stream the big match from the broadcaster\u0026rsquos website but admitted that despite improvements, most online services still had a significant time delay compared with digital TV output.                \u0027We will make you proud\u0027 Harry Kane in pledge to nation ahead of matchHe said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos one of the flaws in an emerging technology.TV audience figure have not been hit by streaming with ITV1 attracting a peak of 24 million viewers for Tuesday night\u0026rsquos match and BBC One will be expecting to beat this on Saturday with more than 32 million expected to tune in.But there has also been enormous parallel growth in the number of fans choosing to watch matches on their mobile phones, especially among younger viewers.Fans who stream the England v Sweden match face a 20 second delay Before the 2018 quarter-finals, 43.5 million people had already livestreamed a World Cup match on the BBC, more than double the number who watched online matches during the whole of Euro 2016.Mr Hall said: \u0026ldquoA number of years ago, people accessing streams online had to be in the office on a PC with a fast broadband connection.\u0026ldquoNow what we tend to see is around 45 percent of stream starts are from people on mobile.Millions of England fans will be watching the game in fansThe combination of affordable high-speed 4G internet connections and improvements in streaming technology has made it possible for people to watch games online and Mr Hall said the BBC was working hard to improve the quality of its service by eradicating time-lag.He said: \u0026ldquoWhile it can be a factor today it shouldn\u0026rsquot be a considered a constraint for the long term."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/england-sweden-bbc-iplayer-down-latest-985486.jpg","title":"england sweden bbc iplayer down latest","story":"BBC iplayer cut out with just minutes before the crucial match came to an endFans watching the game on the streaming service said BBC iplayer went down with only three minutes remaining of the game against Sweden.An outraged fan took to Twitter and said: \u0026ldquoiplayer goes down with three minutes to go...

but what is the difference between a soft and hard Brexit?As six senior Conservatives argued for closer links between Britain and the EU they also said Labour and other parties should have a say in the final deal.The Tory manifesto vowed to withdraw Britain from the single market and the customs union, so that we can end free immigration and quit the EU court.But Labour has not signed up to that approach, raising the prospect that cross-party talks could lead to a softer form of Brexit which might anger many Leave voters.A soft Brexit would see the UK have a similar membership of the European Economic Area to that of Norway.This would mean the country would still have access to the single market, while being able to make deals without the rest of the EU.It would also see the UK stay within the EU customs union - meaning exports would not be subject to border checks or tariffs.And a softer Brexit could see the UK making payments into EU budgets and accepting the four freedoms of movement of goods, services, capital and people.Free access for European nationals to work and settle in the UK would also continue.A hard Brexit would take Britain out of Europes single market.It could also see Britain leave the trade agreement completely, allowing us to strike up deals with other nations around the globe.Anti-EU voices insist a hard Brexit must be met to satisfy the wishes of the Brexit referendum vote.That would mean Britain severs all formal free trade ties with the continent, leaving it free to negotiate new trade links with countries including the USA, China, India and Commonwealth states.Mrs May had also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, when planning to carve out a hard Brexit.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.Scottish Tories leader Ruth Davidson – one of the party’s biggest stars after swiping 12 seats from the SNP – led the charge against a hard Brexit as she spoke alongside her MPs in the days following the election.She said: “I want to ensure that we can look again at issues like Brexit which we know we are now going to have to get cross-party support for.Former minister Anna Soubry, who is fiercely pro-EU, insisted the PM must “absolutely” water down her Brexit plans.Nicky Morgan said the Government must “build a consensus across the Commons” – and said the PM should “compromise” on the Brexit plans she has already laid out.And former leader and PM David Cameron made a rare intervention, telling a business conference in Poland: I think there will be pressure for a softer Brexit.Mrs May has already offered EU citizens in the UK the right to remain in the country in exchange for a similar guarantee for Brits in Europe.Theresa May - wants a two-year transition deal before we fully leave the EU, says Brexit means BrexitPhilip Hammond - the key voice for a soft Brexit, wants to stick closely to EU rules, even after any transition periodAmber Rudd - has backed May and wants close alignment with the EUBoris Johnson - a key figure in the pro-Brexit campaign. He wants Britain to have freedom to decide its own regulations and laws, in order to do things in a distinctive way in the future.David Davis - a Brexit supporter who wants the UK to move away from EU regulations after the exit, but is said to favour a more pragmatic path than some of his fellow Leave-supporting ministers.Jeremy Hunt - initially a remain supporter but now says he has changed his mind and would vote Leave if given the choice again, blaming the European Commissions arrogant behaviour for his switch in attitude.Michael Gove - another key Brexit campaigner and wants to break from EU rules.Leader Jeremy Corbyn set out the partys position on Brexit in a key speech back in February 2018.He said: Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union... to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need whatsoever for a hard border in Northern Ireland.Labour want to remain closely tied to the EU after Brexit.But any deal would remain dependent on the UK being able to negotiate future trade deals with countries outside the customs union.European Council President Donald Tusk has said time is running out and issued a last call.He said June 2018 the most difficult issues remained unresolved and called for quick progress to be made if an agreement was to be reached in October.Theresa Mays Cabinet is due to meet in early July at Chequers for a crunch meeting.May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said at the EUs June summit: “We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the non-deal.“We have to do it.”When quizzed on the Irish border, Mr Juncker said: “As far as Ireland is concerned, I was there the other week. I would like us to give a final definite response to the Irish problem, which is not an Irish problem but a problem in tern by the decision of the British.“I wouldn’t like us to be in a situation where the last remaining point would be the Irish problem.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s absolutely possible.“It’s going to be clear blue skies ahead, with perhaps a little patchy cloud in the afternoon.”But while sun-worshippers flock to the beach to soak up the rays – the sweltering conditions have caused havoc on the roads.Yesterday a bin lorry sank into roads in Newbury, Berkshire, after the tarmac collapsed in searing temperatures.The truck had to be lifted clear by a crane as the heat rose to 29.9C.While the country could also be on the verge of its first hosepipe ban since 2012 with United Utilities warning that ban in the North West was just “days away”.The Met Office has issued its own warning to people looking to make the most of the Mediterranean conditions. Sophie said: “If people are spending a day out, UV levels are going to very high so take care with sunscreen and stay in the shade during middle of day.“Pollen levels are high at the moment due to the dry weather and the grass is struggling, with a lot of it turning it brown."},{"url":null,"title":"pool manager calls cops black man wearing socks memphis tennessee","story":"Camry Porter was at the Riverset Apartments pool in Memphis, Tennessee, on the Fourth of July with her boyfriend and two godchildren when they were targeted by community manager Erica Walker.Video footage suggests Walker flipped out after Porter’s boyfriend dipped his feet in the water while wearing socks, and demanded the clothing item be removed immediately.During the bizarre exchange between the two women, Walker is captured in mobile phone footage in a heated debate with the couple.She is repeatedly heard saying the socks were “against proper pool attire” - despite many other residents apparently flouting the rules - before proceeding to whip out her phone to call the police.Porter can be heard saying: “I think shes calling the police because he has on socks.“Shes walking off making a phone call to whoever she needs to call.“I havent said anything crazy to her, but I did tell her I was not going to leave.”According to Porter, Walker identified herself as the buildings manager and demanded that her boyfriend follow the rules or leave the facility.According to local TV station WREG 13, Walker had informed the family that hats were also banned poolside attire – this part of the conversation allegedly took place moments before Porter began recording.However, the footage clearly shows several of Walker’s friends wearing caps in and around the pool, leading Porter to believe the incident may have had an ulterior motive.Speaking to WREG 13, she said that she “never makes race an issue” generally, adding: “But it does look funny.“Its 25, 30-plus white people out here and you havent said anything — youre partying with them. Youre partying with them! But when we come, its an issue.”Following an internal investigation, the Trilogy Real Estate Group confirmed that they felt Walker had acted inappropriately and had fired her.In a statement, the company said: “After assessing statements from Ms. Porter and determining that this former employees actions violate our companys policies \u0026amp beliefs, she is no longer employed by Riverset Apartments.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418577086.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg brexit theresa may chequers summit","story":"The influential backbencher said the EU could still hamper our ability to strike trade deals with the rest of the world — likening the Governments position to an egg that is very softly boiled.“A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker, he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.He also threatened he would instruct his 60-strong group of Brexit-backing MPs to vote down the proposals.Mr Rees-Mogg said: “This will require legislation and if, when we get the detailed legislation, it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative Party’s manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.”His comments come after Theresa May claimed a crushing victory over her Brexiteer ministers as she forced her Cabinet to back her vision of a soft Brexit during a crunch summit at her Chequers country retreat.After a marathon all day summit yesterday, the Prime Minister hailed a “collective agreement” for a controversial 12 point plan that will tie Britain to Brussels rules for goods and mirror EU judges diktats.A proposed new “UK-EU Free Trade Area” will see a “combined customs territory” set up in a bid to solve the Northern Irish border headache.Under these plans Britain will be forced to collect tariffs on goods on behalf of Brussels - despite firm objections to this from David Davis and Boris Johnson.But there were no immediate walk outs from the government despite criticism from the Leave supporting ministers - to the relief of Downing Street.However one senior Brexiteer said: “This looks to me as though we have reneged on the Referendum.”And critics warned the agreement was a “recipe for total capitulation to Brussels” after a tentative welcoming of the new deal from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Pro-Brexit groups were scathing of the PMs Brexit blueprint.In a withering assessment Leave Means Leave boss John Longworth said the PM had totally misled 17.4million voters and branded her plans a fake Brexit.He added: We will be controlling neither laws, nor trade, nor borders. A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he

I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and thats exactly what we will do.But well do it in a way that protects and enhances our economy for the future.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and Mrs Mays chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.It comes a day after May reportedly threatened to sack Boris Johnson after claiming her crushing victory over Brexiteer ministers.The Prime Minister is said to have promised allies she will not tolerate any attempt by the Foreign Secretary to undermine the deal.The Times revealed her threat to Boris following a marathon all-day summit at her Buckinghamshire country retreat, at which they agreed a Soft Brexit 12-point plan that will tie Britain to Brussels rules for goods and mirror EU judges diktats.In a letter to Conservative MPs later, May made clear that ministers who complained about her plan would be sacked.She said: “As we developed our policy on Brexit I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their individual views.Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.It followed fears Mr Johnson would lead half-a-dozen Eurosceptics to quit.May appears to have faced down Brexiteer Cabinet ministers after securing agreement on plans which will keep the UK closely aligned to Brussels.The proposals will now be assessed by the European Union.But under the Governments plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.Brussels will be reluctant to support any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a no deal Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals, which will be produced in a formal White Paper next week, would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Pro-Brexit groups were scathing of the PMs Brexit blueprint.In a withering assessment Leave Means Leave boss John Longworth said the PM had totally misled 17.4million voters and branded her plans a fake Brexit.However, business leaders, who have raised concerns about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy, welcomed the Cabinet agreement.Despite the plan, Mrs Mays position could still be under threat from Tory Brexiteers.Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was awaiting the detail of the plans before deciding whether or not to support calls for a leadership contest."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418470996.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"486\" width=\"960","title":"russian zoo animals noahs ark ryazan circus cruelty","story":"Prosecutors in the country are said to be investigating the travelling Noahs Ark amid reports of animals in cramped cages with no shade.The shocking video shows animals laying motionless after activists say they were left without water in soaring temperatures.They also claim animals have died at the zoo and that animals were heard screaming out.Activists have described the terrible smell with animals left in a critical condition.A report from activists said: A volunteer walked inside and immediately saw a foal lying motionless on the tarmac under direct sun.The animals are obviously in a critical condition – they are hot. They have no single source of water.They also claim to have found two bears lying in their own excrement.Lions and tigers appear to have been left in cramped conditions in the zoo in the city of Ryazan.The state prosecutors office is now said to have launched an investigation after complaints referring to the screams of distressed animals.But zoo administrator Rudik Avagimov is reported to have denied any problems.He said: All is fine with the animals, they have the biggest cages in Russia.We have passed all veterinary control tests."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4355363.jpg?20180706221224 ","title":"chequers mate brexiters rely on eu rejecting pms win","story":"More than that, as was made clear in an email to MPs afterwards, for the first time since February 2016, cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit was firmly reasserted.No more special licence for ministers to speak their mind on this issue. Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired.Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a \"very positive conclusion\" which meant \"zero friction\" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the \"positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan\".Not much from the Brexiteers just yet.:: \u0027Sell out\u0027 free trade area plans torn apart by BrexiteersThe statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure \"PM wrestles Brexit triumph\" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties.The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear.But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider.Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement.The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union.No longer is it \"as frictionless as possible\", which was always fairly meaningless but actually \"frictionless\".The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains.The answer is a \"free trade area for goods\" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed.:: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talksIt is not membership of these structures however.The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries.The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker.It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel.The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them.Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it.Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. \"As bad as I feared,\" said one.A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was \"deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven\u0027t worked so hard all these years for this\".One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: \"If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?\" Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery.How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for \"a clean Brexit\" is another.\"I can\u0027t see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,\" one former senior minister said.It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy.The most evident possible method for that is the section on a \"labour mobility partnership\" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU. This will help lubricate any single market deal. It will also inflame internal political opposition.There is also a section on \"no deal\" preparations, meant as a stick for the EU and a carrot for Brexiteers.If the PM cannot stomach a Canada-style trade deal because of the negative impact on advanced manufacturers, it seems that \"no deal\" is inconceivable.So we are left in an extraordinary position.The hard Brexiteers need the EU to reject this out of hand now.The EU will have noted the shift in Government position, the actual adoption of one, and see a landing point at least for many years that is close to the European Economic Area (EEA) plus customs union solution they anticipate and prefer.We are probably three quarters of the way there already.Do they split the difference and pay lip service to a magical Europe-wide tariff refund IT system in a few years? Or do they undo the PM\u0027s impressive manoeuvres with outright rejection?The devil will be in the detail, to be released in the white paper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-thailand-cave-boys_4351503.jpg?20180703153714 ","title":"elon musk ramps up efforts to help save boys trapped in thailand cave","story":"\"Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks.\"Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.\":: \u0027Take me for grilled pork\u0027: Notes written by boys trapped in cave in fullMusk\u0027s company, Boring Co, which digs tunnels for transport systems and has advanced ground-penetrating radar, is being utilised to help rescue the team. \"Will do my best to help the team,\" he tweeted, before adding: \"The team will dig deep and will help at the best of ability.\"Among his tweets about the rescue, he also said: \"But let\u0027s not submit to the bad mood entirely.

Alternative options are being considered, including finding a shaft or drilling into the mountain in which the cave is located.

Visitors must leave by 25 July. To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game.The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia.Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip.The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven\u0027t signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia. I\u0027ve got my documents, how do I get there?Bear in mind that the main international airport (Sheremetyevo) is around two hours from Luzhniki Stadium by public transport. It is around half that by car - on a good day.If you\u0027re travelling from London, the latest you could leave is probably the 10.40am departure from Heathrow, which arrives in Moscow at 4.25pm.

A flight arriving at 5.05pm will take five hours and 45 minutes, setting you back \u0026#163615. There\u0027s a six-hour journey arriving at 3.20pm for about the same price. I don\u0027t want to fly, how else can I get there?If you have the endurance, driving will take you around 29 hours - it\u0027s about1,800 miles.

The most popular route would be to get the Eurostar to Brussels and then further trains to Cologne and Berlin.You\u0027ll probably need to overnight in Berlin before the morning journey to Warsaw, which takes around six hours. Later on day two, you would catch a sleeper train from Warsaw to Moscow. But beware, these trains only run on certain days of the week. Will there be anywhere for me to stay?Moscow is Russia\u0027s capital city and, as well as the big game, you could easily spend some more time there enjoying the historic centre, the architecture, shopping, museums and other activities.The 2016 population estimate was 12.19 million people.Accommodation options include hostels from \u0026#1635 per person per night, three-star accommodation ranging from around \u0026#163120 to \u0026#163280, and the luxury end of the scale for more than \u0026#1632,000.Do I need to speak Russian to get around?The fan zones are equipped to deal with English speakers.

Massive stress, exhausting hours, poor pay, fear of making mistakes and inability to guarantee patients’ safety have all contributed to staff wanting out of wards in their tens of thousands. A shocking 43 per cent say they are feeling so much strain they would like to leave the profession right now. Half are under daily pressure to save cash, have witnessed patients suffer due to Tory cuts and seen rationing of services that were free five years ago. Three-quarters say the service no longer has enough staff to look after people safely. And an overwhelming 78 per cent – four out of five – feel under-valued and unfairly paid. One nurse told the survey, carried out by the Sunday Mirror with Nursing Standard magazine: “Everyone is pushed to the limit of capability.” The poll paints a grim picture in the week that saw the NHS, which employs 300.000 nurses and midwives, mark the 70th anniversary of its launch in 1948. The only ray of light is that an amazing 68 per cent of nurses STILL feel proud to have played a role in the service.  Tonight Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “This tragic situation is the result of many years of short-sighted cost-cutting and ineffective workforce planning. “Too many politicians and policymakers don’t recognise the value of nursing. Extra funding must begin to turn this around by investing in staff to stop the haemorrhaging we see.” Our poll also found 42 per cent of nurses feel stressed most of the time and 16 per cent all of the time. Another 42 per cent say morale is poor, with 19 per cent describing it as at rock bottom. One nurse told us she was having to care for up to 30 patients each, almost four times the one-to-eight ratio in guidelines. Another told how 16 staff had left and been replaced by only two while shifts put out to the “bank” of floating stand-ins often went unfilled. One nurse said: “Many colleagues are leaving or having time off for stress. They are disillusioned and work in a state of anxiety due to the fear of error in poorly-staffed wards.” Another described their job as “like being on a production line” rather than dealing with people. One said: “I will retire as soon as I can and work in Tesco’s.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lets fly english flag pride","story":"NewsopinionLabour\u0027s Rosena Allin-Khan calls on fans to fly the English flag with pride and reclaim it from the far rightThe shadow sports minister writes exclusively for the Mirror on why we should all display the St George\u0027s Cross to cheer on Harry Kane and the rest of the team\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDr Rosena Allin-Khan18:39, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:45, 6 JUL 2018NewsopinionRosena Allin-Khan MP is proud to fly (and wear) the St George\u0027s flag\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLet’s fly the English flag with pride.

Whether sticking out of a car window, bunting going across a school playground or hanging over a pub window - England flags were everywhere. Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury’s would have shelves full of all sorts of England merchandise – this World Cup, I can’t find any!  Over the years, flying the flag has become more and more synonymous with the far-right – but why should they have any more right to fly the St George’s Cross than you or I? The English flag has become associated with the national front, the EDL and other far right groups– it frustrates me. It frustrates me because we have allowed this to happen.  Collectively, we hesitate to fly the English flag with pride during major sporting events because we are worried about the connotations behind the way it has been hijacked. When our sporting men and women represent us across the world, we should all be able to fly the flag with pride. No more should this be the case than right now, especially given the fantastic chance England have. I am proud to be born and raised in England and enjoy supporting my national team, England. With millions of other fans across the country, I am not alone.  I want the England flag to be associated with English sporting successes and I don\u0027t want us to hesitate flying it. It should be associated with Freddie Flintoff and the team winning the ashes, Bobby Moore lifting the World Cup, with Anthony Joshua beating Wilder – not far-right extremists fighting police down Whitehall.

Matthew Wilcox and Amy Roberts lived in Llanrug in North Wales until February, but lost their home when their landlord put it up for sale and were housed in Caernarfon.  Their baby Lili, who was born in April and has Down\u0027s Syndrome, needs to have open heart surgery, and the couple have asked to be moved back to Llanrug so they can be close to the relatives they rely on.  Despite support from doctors, the Down\u0027s Syndrome Association and the school of their older daughter, Gwynedd Council has refused to move them out of Caernarfon.   In a letter to the couple, housing chiefs said by the time another property becomes available in Llanrug, their daughter will have had her heart surgery (and will) hopefully be less likely to need emergency intervention.  Matthew told the Daily Post the council\u0027s suggestion that Amy, a lab worker who suffers from anxiety, should travel four miles on the bus every day to see family is not viable.  The 33-year-old public sector worker also questioned how the council could know better than the experts about Lili\u0027s future health. He said: Not even the doctors can say whether Lili will be okay after surgery, so how does the council know? And how do they expect Amy to get a bus if Lili\u0027s feeding tube comes out, for example, and she needs to take her to hospital? She would need to drop our two-year-old off at her dad\u0027s first and then jump on a bus to the hospital. The service from Caernarfon to Llanrug has also been reduced to one every hour - and that\u0027s if it turns up. And what if Amy has an anxiety attack on the way? They\u0027re not recognising mental health as a disability. It\u0027s been a very difficult time for us.  However, the council has said the case will not be reopened unless their circumstances change or significant new information was submitted. In a letter to the couple on June 22, the council said: Having carefully considered the submissions made I am satisfied that the property is suitable for your needs, and your household, and reasonable for you to accept. Matthew added: I have provided them with everything I can, and they have ignored everything. They are supposed to take all this evidence into account and they\u0027re not. We fail to see how a letter from the Downs Association cannot be classed as substantial new evidence. What would be classed as substantial new evidence?

An emergency response vehicle was vandalised in London after fans jumped on it and it now unable to respond to patients.  The Joint Response Unit tweeted: Obviously we are chuffed with this result this afternoon but there is absolutely NO excuse to vandalise emergency service3 vehicles by jumping on them. We are better than this England.  Topless fans blocked off one of Hull\u0027s main roads and chanted \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 after celebrating the win this afternoon.

Video footage also shows a handful of people on top of a building in the city centre waving their St George flags and chanting after the match was screened at Nottingham Castle. Some fans may have had trouble getting home as the trams were unable to operate due to the sheer volume of people standing on the tracks. In frustration, some were seen punching and kicking the trams.  A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: There are no arrests in relation to the damage caused after the football at this time. “The damage was caused by an unknown offender but an investigation will take place in due course. “The car involved in the incident has been taken away.” And huge crowds are blocking traffic in London.

Each has been left with physical scars in their fight against cancer. The wounds are a permanent reminder of their battle with an illness that kills over 177,000 people in the UK each year. But for each of the women, the scars are not a reason to hide away. They are a reason to stand tall. And they are a reason to celebrate. Celebrate not what they have lost, but what they have gained – a second chance at life. These \u0026shyinspirational women, helping promote Cancer Research UK Race for Life fundraisers, have also all been treated by the NHS – as it celebrates 70 years. Here are their amazing stories. Tasha  Conveyancy worker Tasha Jilka, 26, was diagnosed in 2010 with a rare facial cancer, olfactory neuroblastoma, when a tumour was discovered behind her left eye. Tasha, from Leicester, explained: “Surgeons had to cut from my ear to my eye to remove the tumour. At one point my eyelids were so swollen I could only see the world through slits in them. I also had radiotherapy, which doctors told me in late 2010 had destroyed the cancer, but the skin tissue was left damaged around my nose, causing it to collapse. “I had to wait two years to have my nose reconstructed while it all healed. The pain was so bad, there was even a time I wished I was dead. “When I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise myself, it was very hard to take. Cancer also robbed me of my sense of smell. If I ever have children I will never know that lovely new baby smell. “But I know now that I need to live my life fully in memory of all the people who have suffered cancer. “I want to do it for me, and for them, because I have been given a second chance. We went to Dubai for my mum’s 50th in 2015 and that has inspired me. What motivates me is all the things I want to achieve. “I realised there are so many beautiful places to visit – like Hawaii, temples in Thailand – and I’m saving up to make those dreams come true.” Charlotte and Rose  Twins Charlotte and Rose Turpie lost their parents to cancer and had double mastectomies when they discovered they were carrying a timebomb gene. BRCA2 increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers and the sisters, 29, decided to take no chances. Veterinary nurse Charlotte, from Belper, Derbys, said: “We were just three when our mum, Sally, was told she had breast cancer. She lived another seven years but died when she was 39. “We were only 10. But the longer I live without her, the harder certain times are. She won’t be there for my wedding, nor birthdays. But out of something so difficult came something positive. We’ve wondered why she had breast cancer at such a young age. But a year before her death experts discovered the BRCA2 gene mutation and they could identify what took her so young. Doctors told us we should get tested and we both came back as being positive.” Sales co-ordinator Rose, who lives in the Peak District village of Chinley, said: “That’s when we decided to have our breasts removed, in 2016. We had initial surgery days apart. Charlotte was at the Derby Royal and I was at Wythenshawe Hospital. “I had breast tissue removed and implants straight away. Charlotte had a mastectomy and had implants a year later. “We both really struggled afterwards with body confidence.  “But then our dad, Paul, died. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and was gone less than two weeks after our surgeries. “It was hell. I can’t describe how dark a place it was to be in. “That is why we are trying to change our futures. I’m proud to show my scars. They give people hope. They don’t define you. “I’m now more body confident than ever. I spend a lot of time in the gym as it’s a great way to stay positive and helps me feel more confident about the way I look. “One of the best moments was standing side-by-side with my sister when we went to a charity ball in November 2017. I felt lovely in a ball gown and it was special to be able to share that with her.” Charlotte added: “That was the first time I’d worn a revealing dress. Rose dressed me and the criss-cross design across my boobs was something I’d never have worn before my surgery. “But I felt empowered and took confidence from being with my sister. It was wonderful to be able to share that after everything.” Maxine  Mum Maxine Turley was diagnosed with rare rhabdomyosarcoma cancer in 1984 – when she was aged just 12. A lump behind her eye that was thought to be caused by an allergy turned out to cancerous. Radiotherapy destroyed the tissue in her eyes and, 17 years later, she made the difficult decision to have her left eye removed. Office administrator Maxine, from Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, is now 46 – and counting her blessings. She said: “I didn’t know at the time, but I only had a 30 per cent chance of surviving. I missed loads of school. “My parents, naturally, tried to protect me from the truth. This year marks 25 years of Race for Life and in that time over eight million women have participated, raising over \u0026pound820m for Cancer Research UK.  The money raised at Race for Life has helped put Cancer Research UK at the heart of progress that has seen survival in the UK double in the last forty years. Maxine, Tasha, Rose and Charlotte have all taken part in Race for Life events, with Tasha and Maxine even doing speeches on the main stages to inspire others with their stories of cancer survival.  There are over 400 Race for Life events running from May to October, including 5k routes, 10k, a half-marathon, hikes and Pretty Muddy the 5k and 10k obstacle course.

And he is set to follow scores of royals before him by wearing the family\u0027s formal christening gown on the big day. Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and made by Scottish dressmaker Janet Sutherland.  It was based on Queen Victoria\u0027s own wedding dress, and was made of Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace. The original was worn by 62 royal babies, including then-Princess Elizabeth - now the Queen - for her christening at Buckingham Palace in 1926. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.  But for just one adult and one child, the price is exactly the same. When selecting one adult, the ad for free child places disappears from the site. Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares. A First Choice holiday to the Holiday Village Rhodes for seven nights cost an extra \u0026pound515 per person for a single adult with one child.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

So when Lindsey decided to tackle her weight, Kirsty did too – as she wanted to still look the spitting image of her sister. With each other for support and inspiration, the twins lost 14st between them. And it may have saved their lives – as doctors have discovered the two share a genetic condition that can increase the risk of heart attacks, which is made worse by being overweight. Kirsty, 34, said: “There was no way when Lindsey started to lose weight that I was going to be left behind as the fat twin. Losing weight with an identical twin is like watching your own progress in a mirror. “We couldn’t have done it alone. Doing it together is what kept us going.  “Seeing my gorgeous slim twin sister is a constant reminder not to overeat. It’s the best incentive we could both have.” The sisters put on weight after their dad died unexpectedly in 2007. Kirsty, who lives in Wrexham with husband Matt, 35, said: “Lindsey and I were both devastated when we lost our dad and we ate our way through our grief, trying to get comfort from it. Our weight rocketed. “Then when I gave birth to my daughter Olivia, now nine, my weight went up even further. Our weight was making us both miserable. Whenever we got together we’d commiserate over a giant pizza. We were fat but at least we had each other.”  At their heaviest, Kirsty weighed 16st 4lb and Lindsey weighed 17st 9lb. Then Kirsty had a heart attack when she was 25 weeks pregnant with son Evan, now four, in 2013. She said: “Thankfully I was all right and Evan was born healthy. But doctors discovered the heart attack was caused by a genetic blood clotting condition Lindsey and I shared. “They said my weight was a contributing factor. So we had to do something about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"manhunt after two men try","story":"NewsManhunt after two men try to kidnap terrified teenage girl by bundling her into MercedesOne of the men said \"you\u0027re coming with me\" in the terrifying incident in Cambridge, leaving her with scratches and afraid to leave the house\u0026nbspShareByRaymond Brown16:19, 7 JUL 2018NewsThe attempted kidnap took place in Arbury Road, Cambridgeshire (Image: Cambridge News / BPM Media)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA manhunt has been launched after two men tried to kidnap a 17-year-old girl by bundling her into a Mercedes.

There\u0027s all the rules she must now follow as the Duchess of Sussex, and it\u0027s a big leap from Hollywood to one of the most famous and traditional families in the world. So you can\u0027t hold it against her for wanting to fit in.  Recently it even seemed as if the Suits actor had adopted an English accent .  It\u0027s not the first time Meghan\u0027s accent has come under scrutinty.   Earlier this year she was accused of putting on British accent after saying the word \u0027scone\u0027 .  A new clip which recently emerged from her visit to Cheshire with the Queen, has convinced royal fans that they can hear a change in her voice.

If we do think Meghan sounds more English, then that\u0027s down to us - not her. Professor of linguistics at Oklahoma State University, Dennis Preston, reveals that any perceived change is in fact down to our brain playing tricks on us.  She married an Englishman, she lives in England, she\u0027s hanging with the Queen, and people think, \u0027Gosh, she must be doing something with her language,\u0027 he told Yahoo .     Essentially, our brain gets in the way of our ear. So we hear what we expect to hear, rather than what we actually do. He went on: I did a very careful listen, paying specific attention to her vowels, a big giveaway with British accents, as well as the intonation. I just didn’t find anything resembling a British accent. There’s nothing there.

The government is believed to be drawing up a new list of items that must be put in the hold. It comes after Australia, the US and New Zealand introduced similar bans last month. They adopted the new rules after Australian officials were rocked by a foiled plot to blow up an Ethiad flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi last year. Islamic State sent the sophisticated device from Syria to a terror cell in Sydney hidden in a meat mincer.  A major terror attack may only have been averted when the suitcase was abandoned at check-in, possibly because it was too heavy.  The Times reports that the new rules could bring powders under the same restrictions as liquids.  All powders would be restricted to 12 ounces or 56 grams and would have to go through further security checks. The rule on liquids were introduced in the wake of 9/11. However, there are fears the new rules could mean even longer lines at airport security. It comes amid worries that the new UK passports, which are blue in colour, will increase queues at border control. The Department of Transport did not comment on The Times\u0027 report.

A colossal \u0026pound10 billion worth of badly performing SIPPs - Self Invested Personal Pensions - are believed to have been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of Brits by unscrupulous financial advisors. Now potential victims are being urged to check if they can reclaim huge portions of their lost cash and the government has set up a special \u0026pound120 million fund to compensate losers so far. A maximum \u0026pound50,000 compensation sum is currently available from the large fund managed by The Financial Service Compensation Scheme and the figure is set to rise by 75 per cent to a \u0026pound85,000 maximum in the next nine months as claims grow. However industry figures such as pension expert Zoe Pearson warn that the true cost of mis-sold pensions is closer to \u0026pound10 billion and will sweep the country like the current phenomenon of PPI claims that has gripped the nation over the past few years.  Read more: Taxed to death: The astonishing amount of income tax people pay decades after leaving work for the last time Miss Pearson, who heads the country’s all female team of claim specialists Pension Claim Consulting Ltd , told : “Thousands upon thousands of people are unaware they’ve been mis-sold SIPPS. Unless you know what to look for it’s difficult to know what a mis-sale is although quite often when people realise they’ve been mis-sold to, they’re too embarrassed to take action. “However, the financial services industry has firm rules, so any mis-sale should be pursued. “Even basic calculations give you an idea of the true scale of this scandal. Average compensation for mis-sales sit at around \u0026pound25,000 for private pensions and \u0026pound50,000 for final salary pensions so the total figure for the mis-sales of SIPPs is going to be around the \u0026pound10bn mark. “In fact if this was brought to the forefront and the government advised people to check the status of their pensions that might even be an underestimation. The government needs to launch an investigation to unearth the true amount.” Labour MP Frank Field has hit out at the SIPP conmen and vowed to bring the industry into line whilst industry experts reveal the true figure of mis-selling is growing at an unprecedented rate and the true loss of mis-selling will run into billions as the number of victims rocket.  Shocking 30.4million Brits face disappointment when they finally get to stop working - the plan to fix it The Financial Ombudsman however are allowed to raise their compensation ceiling and can award up to a further maximum of \u0026pound150,000 for many cases. The SIPP scams involved unscrupulous Financial Advisors preying on savers who were promised massive returns of up to 20 per cent a year only for their savings to be squandered on get rich quick schemes including investing in airport parking, holiday properties and green energy projects. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed one in eight savers think an advisor has mis-sold them a financial product such as a pension. The FCA advise people who think they have been mis-sold a pension to raise a complaint as soon as possible as there are time-limits in place which could affect the outcome of your claim. Their report called the Financial Lives Survey was widely praised by industry experts who believe that the government have underestimated the scale of mis-sold pensions such as SIPPs however the Commons Work and Pensions Committee have demanded tighter safeguards to protect savers. Committee Chairman Frank Field MP said: “I am concerned about the role of SIPPs as platforms that help funnel unwitting clients’ pension savings into dodgy and inappropriate investments. SIPPs are happy to skim off their fee on the way but there are serious questions about their commitment to due diligence and consumer protection. “When an unscrupulous financial advisor channels a victim’s money through a SIPP into an investment that then collapses, it is not enough for the SIPP provider to shrug their shoulders and say ‘caveat emptor’. “I will be writing to the FCA to ask what they are doing to ensure SIPPS are not acting as handmaidens to the pension-snatchers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"owners urged check dogs eyes","story":"NewsOwners urged to check their dogs’ eyes or risk them going blindDry eyes is a common condition that can lead to infections, ulcers and even eyes being removed – but only half of ­owners are aware of it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Spencer19:06, 7 JUL 2018NewsA dog with dried eyes\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOwners are being urged to check their dogs’ eyes or risk them going blind.

It was a last resort to get my happy \u0026shypuppy back.” The first symptom her \u0026shylabrador boxer cross Scully showed was conjunctivitis. Despite various treatments, he stopped producing tears. He had \u0026shysurgery to direct his salivary glands to his eyes but this failed so he lost his left eye. Then, two months later, the condition hit his right eye.  Nicole, a vet nurse from Tranent, near Edinburgh, chose to lose the eye rather than have him put to sleep. She said: “Scully now navigates his way around home with his sense of smell and senses where \u0026shyobstacles are.” One in five vulnerable breeds and one in 20 of all dogs suffer with dry eye at some stage in their life. Symptoms include eyes appearing red and sore, repeated cases of \u0026shyconjunctivitis, excessive blinking or eye rubbing, discharge and eyes \u0026shyhaving a dry and dull appearance. Trendy breeds such as pugs and bulldogs with eyes that pop out are more at risk, as are cocker and cavalier King Charles spaniels, westies, and pekingese pups.

Even though they\u0027re still months away from meeting their baby, the changes to their day-to-day life start immediately. There\u0027s a whole host of foods they can no longer eat, they can\u0027t drink and they will sometimes have to give up the hobbies they love. But there\u0027s one thing Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, is refusing to give up despite that growing baby bump.   Writing in her column for Waitrose Weekend , the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s little sister, 34, explains why she is still playing tennis.  She said: I\u0027ve been a tennis fan since childhood, as player and spectator, and have been keen to continue playing safely throughout pregnancy. Take Serena Williams – she famously proved that women can play a high level of tennis from two months (when she won the 2017 Australian Open) up to eight months. Few of us can relate to this elite excellence, but if you\u0027re a healthy, well-trained player with an uncomplicated pregnancy there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t continue a good level of tennis.  It is believed Pippa is due in October. And it\u0027s not just playing which Pippa enjoys, and she\u0027s a regular at Wimbledon. She was in the crowds for day four of this year\u0027s competition with her brother James.

Catherine Purcell, 68, died while being eaten alive and lying in a “cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid” at the home she shared with her daughter in Kirkby, Liverpool .  This week, her husband John Purcell, 72, and 35-year-old daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were given suspended jail sentences for neglecting the disabled great-grandmother.  Prosecutors said the great-grandmother\u0027s bed was so soiled it had been chemically destroyed by her own bodily fluids, the Liverpool Echo reported.   David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, said this reaction burned the skeletal victim’s skin and her infected body was then fed on by maggots. He argued during that the pair knew she was dying, but failed to seek medical aid, which three weeks beforehand would have saved her life. During the harrowing trial into the death of Mrs Purcell, Mr McLachlan read out messages exchanged between Purcell junior and her sister Kellie, who had not visited the house for six months and was not charged with any offences. The messages were sent days before the pensioner died on July 11, 2016, and included Purcell junior likening her mum to a pig lying in s***.  One message read: Ye girl co dad said fore to just ignore her for a bit and let her do with put cuppa tea and biffs let’s see if she’ll give in that way but every time one of us walk in she gets worse surly she can smell it in her f***ing hands when she smoking Oh I jus don’t know what to do coz she can’t walk so I can’t even get her to the bath room to giv her a bath and no matter what way we look at her were gona end up with this all over use as well even if she could walk she’s gonna have us plasted in s*** as well she’s just not assed to say the least girl either she isn’t a bit bothered that she’s like that she licks off if we tell he to at least wash her hands to eat her tea etc. She f***ing flipped on dad av few times now coz she’s had to get wash she like pig lying in her Own s*** descusting I feel like f***ing dragging her by the head and f***ing throwing her in the f***ing bath tats how bad she is girl.  In one text, Kellie Purcell asked: Have u sorted little room yet girl I got bedding for single and double here just finishing sorting curtain now sweat p***ing out of me like tap carnt breath \u0026amp I stink. Her sister replied: No have I f*** girl I can’t be assed what’s the point am going to jail any how so dads keeps telling me. The f***ing point is it needs doing oh I be round in morning, came the reply. Other messages appeared to show Kellie Purcell offering to help out but being repeatedly ignored by her sister.  And she lashed out at her sibling in another message, accusing her of pure laziness for not helping their mum. She wrote: I agree about mum if use would of let Carers in u would have been better but the state the house is in cath and me mum got f*** all to do with not being able to cope it pure laziness. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Purcell died from pneumonia, dehydration and skin ulcers, including a hip ulcer penetrating to the bone.  The victim, who weighed just five and a half stone, also had undiagnosed cancer of the tongue, which would have made swallowing painful. Mr Purcell claimed he didn’t realise his wife was “severely malnourished”, or her stained legs covered in sores, despite changing her clothes. He accepted her bedroom was “disgraceful”, but said he didn’t know it was that filthy until she died, because the bed was covered by a duvet.

He is among millions around the country enjoying the Three Lion\u0027s glorious 2-0 victory against Sweden in the World Cup quarter-finals this evening. But not all the celebrations have exactly gone according to plan. In Clapham Junction the jumper joined hundreds lining the streets in the sizzling sunshine chanting and clapping to mark Harry Kane and his team making history. The man - dressed in a blue top and shorts and evidently bursting with pride - clambers on top of a double decker bus and can be seen in a video swinging his arms chanting \u0027ooh ooh.\u0027 He encourages the crowd to join in as he leads the celebrations.  There are cheers as he and another man, dressed in a red top, dance on top of the double deck bus and nearby bus stop roof. And they can be seen swinging their arms, jumping and dancing as they soak up the atmosphere - until the man in blue leaps from the bus onto the bus stop and smashes through the glass roof. The clapping stops and gasps can be heard as he lands smack on the concrete in his side. But miraculously in true Brit style he gets up and walks it off. The glass roof is left hanging, while the man in red - still on the top of the bus stop - appears to question how he can get down safely and avoid the same fate as his pal.  The video which has been posted online has received mixed reactions. One person said: Love how he got up and styled it out, nothing to see here!! Another added: How did he just walk it off. While Brian Kane wrote: The guy with the hat just keeps on clapping as if nothing happened. However, some think he\u0027s gone too far.  Meanwhile, in Southampton a man has been caught surfing across three MOVING double decker buses to celebrate England\u0027s win.

Claire Greenley, 35, even said police would have a fight on their hands and the street would help out when she was told officers were on their way to rescue the children. Hull Crown Court heard how the youngsters who were in Ms Greenley\u0027s care were left in squalid conditions with human excrement smeared on the sink, windows, walls and stairs. The children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found to have suffered emotional and psychological harm and are now recovering, reports Hull Live.   Megan Rhys, prosecuting, said when authorities visited the east Hull property last year, the garden was strewn with furniture and rubbish from split black bin bags. The real horrors were inside the house, where Greenley was found unkempt and smelling unpleasant, as if she had not been looking after herself. The house was filled with bags and piles of dirty clothes, to the point where it was difficult to find floor space not covered by rubbish. The bathroom door was off its hinges, and inside was a 2.5ft high pile of soiled clothing. The floor was barely visible, Miss Rhys said. There was faecal matter on the sink unit and three to four human stools on the stairs, which had dried and clearly been there for some time and stepped in. The visitors also found faeces smeared on the wall of a bedroom.  An upstairs window and the letter box had also been smeared with excrement, the court heard. An inspector said it was the worst property he\u0027d seen in ten years. Miss Rhys said: It\u0027s difficult to say how long the property had been in that state. It\u0027s clearly not something that had happened overnight. When Greenley was interviewed by police, she accepted the house was uninhabitable. Greenley, who had no previous convictions, later admitted child cruelty offences. Cathrine Kioko-Gilligan, mitigating, said Greenley had previously been the victim of domestic violence, and suffered mental health problems after the breakdown of that relationship.  Her home became unmanageable and she was too ashamed and embarrassed to seek assistance. Sentencing Greenley, Judge David Tremberg said the house was comprehensively unfit for human habitation, and was squalid and unkempt from top to bottom, with the smell and presence of faeces about the place.

But, instead of the acrobats they had expected, the English visitors watched in horror as bears were forced to perform for a baying audience.  Five of the animals were made to play musical instruments, balance on balls and even ride on horses during the Samara State Circus performance - billed as a family fun event.   Camels were also paraded around the arena as crowds packed with children watched on. Some disgusted Three Lions fans walked out of the show, which was emblazoned with official logos for the World Cup.  One supporter told The Sun : When the bears came out I started to feel uncomfortable because it was clear that this was not a natural environment for them.   “They had been trained to do things like catch flowers, or roll on a ball and there was one on the back of a horse. “After what we felt was a number of disturbing acts for a bear to be involved in, we left as we felt it was a show that we were no longer interested in watching.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"creators of famous viking centre in york to open new exhibit in tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVikings will invade the local area this summer with an exhibition featuring a 15ft boat, a skeleton and a replica ancient Nordic house being staged at Perth Museum.Vikings: Fearsome Craftsmen explores the day-to-day lives of the formidable Norse warriors and the interactive event will introduce visitors to the Viking way of life, including their craft skills.Those who attend the exhibition, which is being run by the creators of the famous Jorvik Viking Centre in York, can also enjoy seeing a 15ft replica Viking fishing boat and an ancient excavated Viking skeleton.Helen Smout, chief executive of Culture Perth and Kinross, urged residents and visitors to “seize the opportunity” to experience what she feels will be a “hit” summer event.She said: “The team at Perth Museum and Art Gallery and across Culture Perth and Kinross have braced ourselves for a very welcome Viking invasion.“The Jorvik Viking Centre is a fantastic step into another time and we are delighted to be hosting an interactive exhibit from the same team, right here in the heart of Scotland.“We look forward to welcoming visitors who have an interest in these incredibly intelligent and creative Norse warriors, and those who are curious to learn more about them in a fun family-friendly environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32d41f02e.jpg ","title":"dad of three luke 34 cured of diabetes after 22 years thanks to double transplant","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA dad-of-three says he feels like a “different person” after receiving a double transplant.Luke Chapman, 34, was given a new kidney and pancreas, having suffered from type 1 diabetes for 22 years and then developed kidney disease.He said that since the operation, he has been cured of the condition – and paid tribute to the staff who treated him for more than two decades.Pancreas and kidney transplants are carried out on patients with kidney disease. In Luke’s case, the new kidney has taken over from his own, which hadn’t worked properly since he was diagnosed.In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in your body. The transplanted pancreas can make insulin and correct this type of diabetes.Luke, an electrician from Montrose, said: “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 12. I took insulin to control that since I was diagnosed.“Unfortunately, my kidney function dropped quite badly and in 2014 I was diagnosed with kidney disease, and started dialysis in 2016.“I was put on dialysis three days a week, which was quite gruelling. The last two years, on the dialysis, it was a struggle, and started to disrupt my life.“I was still managing to work but I was tired all the time. I was limited to one litre of fluid a day, which is hard, and your diet is restricted as well.

But at 5.50pm, the doctor came and said, ‘that’s your pancreas here’.“They had harvested it first, before the kidney, but from the same donor. It’s strange because you never know if the day will come or not. It was surreal.“I’ve had diabetes for 22 years and now I’m cured. I feel like a different person. I was at the beach yesterday with my kids running around – I couldn’t have done that five weeks ago.“With keeping my full-time job I was going home and just feeling rotten and sleeping a lot. But my employer, WM Mustard \u0026amp Son Ltd has been fantastic with me.“I lost almost 10kg in three days after the operation. The new kidney needs time to be regulated by the body, so it was in overdrive, removing everything from my body.“I’m now starting to put weight back on.“I’m on about 22 tablets in the morning for various things. That will continue, but the dosage will drop after three and then six months.“But the prognosis is I can eat, drink or do what I want.“The treatment I have had from the NHS has been impeccable and the staff have been brilliant.”Luke has been told the age and sex of his donor, and will shortly be told how they died. He plans in due course to write to their family, thanking them.He added: “If anyone is thinking of signing up to be a donor, please do it. You could be saving the lives of six or seven people in the process.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

It was not bad but I was prepared to see better because of how they have trained.“I have been very pleased with them so far.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

at glebe park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew-look Dundee United looked good as they strolled to victory in the sunshine at Brechin on Tuesday night.Playing what could be the only public friendly of their build-up to the new campaign, the Tangerines started with eight of their nine summer signings.And all impressed as Csaba Laszlo’s men knocked the ball around well and breached the home defence on two occasions.Encouragingly for the several hundred fans who chose to escape England’s World Cup win over Colombia and made the journey to Glebe Park, there was a cohesion about United’s play that probably no one had a right to expect so early in the rebuilding process that’s been undertaken since the disappointment of missing out on promotion at the end of last season.What was apparent within a few minutes of kick-off was Laszlo has added strength and energy to his squad.From a defence that was well marshalled by Frederic Frans to a front line led ably by Craig Curran, the team looked sharp and powerful.Frans looks exactly the kind of dominant defender that was needed to replace Bilel Mohsni, who’d done so well during his short stay towards the end of last term.And out wide Callum Booth showed his Premiership quality at left-back, while Sam Wardrop on the right did enough to suggest he will be an able replacement for his former Celtic youth team-mate Anthony Ralston.In the middle of the park Austrian Christoph Rabitsch added bite, while ahead of him Curran and Nicky Clark showed good understanding for their first outing up front together.Elsewhere, wide man Fraser Aird was first to show what he can bring to the team when he picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and jinked his way past several challenges before netting with a low shot.That opener came with just seven minutes or so on the clock but already United were knocking the ball around in the manner their gaffer likes.It wasn’t just about the new boys, however, and the few familiar faces in the line-up gave a good account of themselves.Sam Stanton was his usual industrial self in midfield and used the ball well. Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

first team.All of that money will be channelled back into manager Derek McInnes’ bid to bring success to Pittodrie both domestically and in Europe.AberDNA was launched in March this year and almost 5,500 fans have signed up to the initiative.The Evening Express can reveal the cash raised – with more than £1m gross taken in.Aberdeen have had a bid of around £500,000 turned down for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis.The Dons will have to shell out more than half-a-million to land Marquis even though Peterborough, who also had a bid rejected, are understood to be out of the race for the 26-year-old.The Reds have already splashed out £200,000 to land midfield playmaker Chris Forrester from Posh.On AberDNA, Milne, said: “Gross we have raised just over £1 million.“But there are obviously costs associated with that.“We lose 20% in VAT straight away.“There is the cost of running the team that is doing the selling job.“Then there is the cost of the products that are part of the DNA.“However, it will leave a sizeable chunk of money that will be fed into the football operation.“It will be in excess of half a million.“We would hope it would be on the right side of £600,000.”The entirely voluntary AberDNA scheme will continue to raise money to be funnelled into strengthening the team every season as the packages require monthly payments.There are four packages that come with various benefits – Premium (£18), Standard (£12), International (£18) and Under-12 (£8).Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5 million.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Milne said: “It has been a fantastic response from the fans and it just shows you the commitment out there from them.“Lots of them are buying season tickets and signing up for DNA.“It is a great initiative and will help strengthen that bond between the club and the fans.“It will enable the fans to feel that they are much more part of the club.“As time goes past that is something that can be developed even further.”Dons boss McInnes aims to strengthen his squad further before the Europa League second qualifying round first leg clash with Burnley on Thursday July 26.Doncaster’s stance is that Marquis is not for sale as he is the club’s leading scorer with40 goals in two seasons.He has two years left on his contract and sources indicate it would take a bid of close to £1m to test Doncaster’s resolve.That is likely to be far too rich for Aberdeen.McInnes has already introduced three new signings for the new campaign with Forrester, Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson and teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson.A training compensation fee has yet to be agreed between Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton.The Reds have offered in excess of £100,000 while Accies are understood to value the 18-year-old at around £900,000.The matter is set to go to an SPFL tribunal with a date still to be set.Aberdeen are confident the final figure will be close to their valuation.McInnes is also in the hunt for defensive cover before the start of the season that kicks off with the Euro clash with Burnley.Aberdeen then face Rangers in a Premiership opener on August 5 that will mark the domestic debut of new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard.Milne said: “We know it is going to be a very challenging league this year.“Rangers are upping their game, Hearts have brought in a lot of new players and I have no doubt once Hibs get going there will be plenty of new players coming in there.“I do think it will be a very competitive league.“We have never had a period since Fergie left where we have effectively delivered so many second-placed finishes.“That is how close we have been for the last five years which is great testament to Derek and his backroom team and the players.“We still have the core of the players that will be part of that this coming season.“It is going to be a big challenge.”With such a competitive Premiership expected will there be recognition of that in McInnes’ budget?“Very much so,” said Milne. “Since Derek joined the club it has been part of growing the budget every year.“We have done various things over the years to help us generate additional cash.“Last year we got the Granite Club operating and this year we have the DNA membership scheme up and running.“The bulk of that additional cash we are trying to feed into the football budget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen for all","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor defender Andy Considine the Dons are a team for the working class and every supporter, regardless of financial situation, should be able to see them in action.Although it’s the Oil Capital of Europe, the 30-year-old acknowledges there are many within the Granite City who are struggling with poverty.The economic downturn has hit the city hard and for some watching the Dons at Pittodrie is not a possibility.Which is why Considine is fully behind the club’s innovative Aberdeen for All scheme, which provides the use of season tickets to the most deserving in the community.Working alongside parent charity Aberdeen FC Community Trust, the Dons will identify families and individuals who will benefit most from the initiative.More than 500 season tickets were issued through Aberdeen for All last season and that is set to rise in the upcoming campaign following the donation of sponsors.Considine, who is set to face St Johnstone in a friendly in Perth tomorrow, said: “Aberdeen is a working-class city and football is a working-class game.“It has always been that way.Regardless of your situation you should be able to come and watch football.“This is a fantastic gesture from everyone involved.“Aberdeen has the oil but that has taken a huge hit over the last couple of years.“This can make a difference for many kids as it offers them the chance to come to a game on a Saturday.”Following Aberdeen’s 2-1 European Cup Winners’ Cup final win over Real Madrid in 1983, Bernabeu legend Alfredo Di Stefano, then Real manager, said “Aberdeen have what money can’t buy – a soul, a team spirit built in a family tradition.”For Considine that philosophy remains at the heart of the club which is why social inclusion for all is so fundamental to the Reds.A product of the Pittodrie youth system, he said: “Aberdeen have always had that family tradition.“This keeps everyone even closer as a community.“To see the smiles on young kids’ faces when they come to watch the football and watch potentially their idols, it is priceless.“It is a great experience for them and it might spur some of them on to become footballers like ourselves.“For a club like Aberdeen that relies on young people coming through the youth system to break into the first team, regardless of whether you have a bit of money or not, you should still be able to have that chance. You should still be able to have that opportunity to make it in football or any sport regardless of your situation.“This type of scheme is potentially getting people on that right track.”Following sponsorship from Aberdeen-based companies, the Dons will be able to reach more deserving families and local community groups via the scheme. The companies are Swire Oilfield Services, Burness \u0026amp Paull, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Simmons \u0026amp Co International.The initiative is also supported by Stewart Milne Group and the Cormack Foundations.Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT) already work with many charities and organisations throughout the city to provide support and opportunities.Considine believes there is a social responsibility for the Reds above and beyond what they do on the pitch.Asked if this expanded as far as donating to food banks he said: “There is one out at Banchory my wife and I have donated at a couple of times. I am sure there are plenty of others who have as well at Aberdeen.“People should be supporting these things.”Aberdeen For All is aimed at individuals in the local community who are in need due to a number of reasons such as social exclusion, financial hardship or other disadvantages.Ally Prockter, chief executive of AFC Community Trust said: “AFCCT is delighted to be working closely with Aberdeen FC in relation to their Aberdeen For All initiative.“Social inclusion is a serious challenge which can be overcome in many ways, and for many people it is important they feel as if they are part of something bigger.“Providing AFC match tickets to those who otherwise cannot attend home games is an important step towards making people feel included in our local community.“We work closely with the club and its sponsors to identify individuals and organisations who can benefit from becoming part of the Aberdeen FC family.’Barry Douglas, Seaton Community Church pastor, is delighted to see a scheme supporting those most in need in the local community.Douglas said: “The people this scheme is helping out are from under-privileged backgrounds and who would not normally have access to football.“You really get to see the joy being brought out in them when they receive their tickets.“The tickets I have distributed so far have gone to families who will get a huge uplift from them.“There are more out there who could benefit from this scheme, so I hope it’s a great success.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"action over terrifying speed of motorists near to school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew measures are to be introduced outside a north-east school after residents complained about motorists driving at “terrifying” speeds.Kintore and District Community Council raised the issue of speeding on the 20mph School Road next to Kintore School at its recent meeting.Now, Aberdeenshire Council says it has taken notice of the community council’s concerns and will take action in the coming weeks.Community council chairwoman Fiona Cooper said: “Some of the drivers on that road are going at a terrifying speed.“Often, it is parents who are going at these speeds, which is a huge concern for us. It’s something that we are absolutely looking into and taking very seriously.“Although the schools are out for summer, we will be picking up this issue when they are back.”Fellow community council member Ken McEwan said: “The community is very disappointed that this is an issue we are facing. By speeding, you are putting the lives of children in danger.”Residents are looking at a number of ways in which the issue of speeding can be addressed.Mr McEwan said: “Various suggestions were mentioned as to how to deter speeding drivers. One is that the current zebra crossing on the road is not clear enough.“It still uses the old Belisha beacons, which are not particularly bright.”Local PC Steven Middleton said: “We work closely with people living in our local communities to make the areas they live in safer places to live and work, so when concerns are raised they are taken seriously.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “We have considered the issues raised by the community council and are planning a number of improvements as a result. We will install LED lights at the zebra crossing near Kintore School to make it more visible and hope to do this over the coming weeks.“We will also check the automatic speed limit sign and are also looking to carry out speed monitoring of the area.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b40a0329f41b-938x564.jpg ","title":"community joins together to say goodbye to popular city school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff have bid a fond farewell to a beloved city school as it closed its doors for the last time after more than 90 years.In an emotional address, Torry Academy head teacher Jenny Cranna brought the community together for the closure of the historic school.With some tears, cheers and a twist of the key, Jenny locked the doors for the final time.The school, which opened in 1927, closed to pupils on Wednesday, but was open to staff for the remainder of the week.After 30 years at Torry Academy, Jenny said: “It’s been a very emotional week especially for the build-up of when the doors would close for the final time.“I think today has proved that we’re just one Torry family and that we all support each other through the happy times and the sad times.“We just encourage and support the unity of Torry.“The numbers are fantastic of those who turned out and people of all ages.“There is something very special about Torry and the community that gets under your skin.“The school and community has been so much a part of my life, it holds a special place in my heart. Even once the school closes, the feelings that I have will continue for the rest of my days.”And former pupil Rhonda Scott was in the crowd.The 54-year-old alumni said: “I started Torry in 1976 and the first thing I remember about Torry is the music and the happiness.“It’s more than a school – it’s a family.“The staff and the way they are with the children and the support that they get.“I’m a teacher and I’ve taught at lots of schools and I also taught here.“This is the best school I have ever taught at – never mind being a pupil.“There’s nothing like that and you don’t understand until you come here.”The school commissioned a commemorative tree sculpture to recognise its role in the Torry community over the last 10 decades.The site will also retain its educational purpose with the construction of a new primary school which will include early learning and childcare facilities and a community hub.John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener, said: “I am delighted to see so many people turn up and it speaks volumes of the impact the school has had on the local community.“I hope that sense of community has a positive future in the new Lochside Academy and carries over.”Kincorth Academy, which closed on Wednesday, marked its closure with an open day for former pupils and staff.Pupils and staff from Torry and Kincorth will start at the new £47 million Lochside Academy on August 23.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crew deals with blaze at aberdeen golf course","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFour firefighters have dealt with a blaze at an Aberdeen golf course.The alarm was raised shortly before midnight last night at the Kings Links Golf Course near Aberdeen beach.One unit was sent from the central station to deal with the incident.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: \u0026#8220We received the call at 11.53pm about a small fire at the Kings Links Golf Course.\u0026#8220We had one appliance in attendance with four firefighters in total.\u0026#8220It was a small fire around 15 metres by 10 metres.\u0026#8220The stop message was received at 12.15am.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dean meets up with old friend prince harry and has a ball","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA record-breaking cyclist from the city has spoken of his pride after his pal Prince Harry attended a ball held in his honour.Former special forces soldier Dean Stott grabbed headlines around the world in May when he became the fastest man to cycle the length of the Americas – the equivalent of cycling from Aberdeen to Bangkok and back in just 99 days.Dean, 41, of Peterculter, was the guest of honour at the glitzy Wheels Down Ball at St James’s Place.Before the black-tie dinner, world record breaker Dean had raised more than £500,000 for eight mental health charities – and the success of the ball has taken the total past the £700,000 mark.The showpiece of the ball was a round table chat hosted by TV presenter Martin Bayfield, in which Dean and the Duke of Sussex – pals from when they were in the Armed Forces – chatted about their friendship and Dean’s achievement.\u0026mdash Alison Baum OBE (@AlisonBaum) July 4, 2018Dean said: “It was a very proud moment for me, to have the support of so many people.“I’ve known Harry for 11 years and we speak often – the last time I’d seen him was his wedding and he had other things to be preoccupied with on that day.”Father-of-two Dean said the Duke of Sussex had commented on the amount of weight he had lost during the 13,670-mile cycle ride along the Pan American Highway from Argentina to Alaska.He added: “It was a fun night and all the better because the setting was so intimate. It was also a pleasure to have Martin there.“It’s important that we keep the conversations about mental health going, and I am pleased with how the evening went.”Among the guests were representatives of NXg Drilling Services and asset management firm Infinity Partners, both of which are based in Aberdeen.Dean, who met Prince Harry when they were partnered during military training, had to leave the military when a parachuting injury left him unable to run.Afterwards, Dean took up cycling and it was a chat with Harry that inspired him to take on the Pan American Highway challenge.The quest began in February at the southern tip of South America, in Ushuaia, Argentina, and took in 13 countries. Along the way, Dean battled harsh winds, multiple collisions, bouts of food poisoning and even a run-in with a polar bear.Dean’s wife, Alana, said: “It was a fitting night at the Wheels Down Ball in many ways because the challenge was two years in the making and we’ve been in it as a family.“Our youngest child, Tommy, is now two and when we began planning the challenge he was still in my belly, and he got the chance to go up on the stage on the night.“We are both pleased that people are feeling more comfortable having conversations about mental health and the superb work the eight charities do in supporting that is to be commended.”The eight charities, which come under the Heads Together umbrella, are: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, Best Beginnings, Calm, Contact, Mind, Place2Be, the Mix and Young Minds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"joy and relief as six mile part of bypass gets ready to open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe imminent opening of a six-mile stretch of the Aberdeen bypass has been greeted with joy and relief.A new temporary road order has been published which will allow for the Balmedie to Tipperty section of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) to open in the coming weeks.The order allows contractor Aberdeen Roads Limited (ARL) to apply for a reduced speed on slip roads at nearby junctions and allow for final preparation works.Six miles of dual carriageway will be opened between Balmedie and Bridgend, as well as improvements made to the existing route between Balmedie and Blackdog.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland project manager, said: “We said we would work with ARL to open new sections of road to bring the benefits of the project to people as soon as possible and practicable.“The publication of the road order is a significant step towards opening the upgraded section of A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty.“While we will only know the exact date when final works and safety inspections are fully complete, this milestone allows the contractor to start the necessary finishing works and certainly signals we’re in the home stretch.“We expect to announce more details in due course.“As always, we thank local communities, road users and businesses from across the north-east for their patience during these works.”The opening has been welcomed by local politicians.Richard Thomson, who represents Ellon and District at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “This is very good news and a real step forward for the project.

Instead, she was taken by medical taxi last Saturday to Stavanger Airport and boarded a private medical aircraft – staffed by a doctor and nurse.She was then taken from Aberdeen International Airport to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary before being allowed to return to her Sheddocksley home on Tuesday after undergoing surgery to correct a problem in a device that regulates her heartbeat.Mrs Kirkton said: “I’m chuffed to be home and that the doctors have done such a good job in Aberdeen.“It was quite an adventure to have my own private plane to get home – that’s another thing ticked off the bucket list.”She added: “I’m grateful to the Evening Express for getting involved and helping to sort it all out.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":null,"title":"win-300-in-our-pet-idol-2018-competition","story":"Calling all animal lovers...\nEntries are now open for this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition \u0026ndash and your chance to win \u0026pound300!\nAll you have to do is send us a photo of your pet - feathered, furry or finned.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver! and Les Miserables.\nGareth told us: \u0026ldquoPerforming with Kerry Ellis was a great experience as she is such an accomplished performance and has a huge following.\n\"After the show, she spent time chatting with us and said she was really impressed with how we sounded and how professional we all were which was great to hear.\nGareth decided to apply for a place The MGA Academy of Performing Arts two years ago as he wanted to stay in Scotland while studying at a level equivalent to prestigious London performing arts colleges.\nThe former Earlston High School pupil told us: \u0026ldquoI have been doing musical theatre since I was a child and grew up performing in school productions of shows such as Miss Saigon, Hairspray and 42nd Street.\n\"I always knew it was what I wanted to do and decided to apply for a place at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts as I\u0026rsquod heard great things about the training there.\n\"My audition actually took place on the day my nephew was born which I think was a good sign.

campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

welcome to this auspicious occasion, the opening of our new clubhouse.\u0026#8216We hope you agree with us that it’s a vast improvement on our previous clubhouse, built in the 1950s.\u0026#8216I would particularly like to welcome our special guest, Ailsa Stewart.\u0026#8216Mrs Stewart was asked to take over the running of the club 70 years ago in her present role as trustee.\u0026#8216Some have

contractors for their amazing work in transforming our club into one fit for the 21st century.\u0026#8216I would like to single out our main contractor, Gerry Nugent. Nothing was ever a problem. He was very reassuring even when we discovered the old clubhouse had no solid foundations.\u0026#8216I first became involved in the club as a 12-year-old looking to escape the house and meet up with friends.\u0026#8216My friends and I spent many hours at the courts, sometimes playing tennis, often not.\u0026#8216Mrs Dickson or Gertie, as we used to call her, was in charge in those days.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

Mrs May insisted that the UK would regain control of its borders, but refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential treatment under the future immigration policy.  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos inner circle is trying to secure support for the proposals to\u0026nbspcreate a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook.  Cabinet Brexiteers have already been persuaded to support the plans after the marathon session of talks at Chequers on Friday, but backbench Eurosceptics have expressed grave doubts.  The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.  Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week commencing July 16.  The Prime Minister told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore leaving the European Union. I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement \u0026ndash free movement will end.  \u0026ldquoThey wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK \u0026ndash that will end.  \u0026ldquoThey wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos exactly what we will do.  \u0026ldquoBut we\u0026rsquoll do it in a way that protects drops and enhances our economy for the future.  Repeatedly pressed on whether the new immigration system would offer preferential access to EU citizens, Mrs May said: \u0026ldquoWe need to look at that in the context of the wider rules we have for immigration from outside of the European Union and we will decide the rules that are right for the UK.

We were dying to get into our chosen profession and start work.  \"But also, it was an exciting and enthusiastic time generally because we all realised what the importance of this great medical and social experiment.  \"But most of us in my year group were enthusiastically approving of the National Health Service.

However, since all junior doctors at that time lived together in a residency at the hospital - a practice phased out from the 1970s - half his salary was automatically deducted to pay for laundry, meals and lodgings.    Nonetheless, Dr Boyd, now 91, said he \"very much regrets\" the loss of this practice. He said: \"It was a great thing. Camaraderie is the word. We stayed there and we all met for meals, we all were in the common room in the evening, and we learned from each other.  \"Weekends usually started at lunchtime on the Saturday. We didn\u0027t think about \u0027contractual hours\u0027 - I don\u0027t remember ever signing a contract. We just did what needed to be done.\"  Speaking at his home in Morningside, Edinburgh, the retired physician said the NHS he joined in 1949 was a very different place to the NHS of 2018.  \"The spectrum of disease then was entirely different to what it is now,\" he said. \"When I was a student, tuberculosis was rife and for example if a child came in with a diagnosis of meningitis-tuberculosis, it was a death sentence.  \"Then at the beginning of being a house officer, streptomycin came in - and it was a miracle. They survived.\"  Read more NHS 70: The transformation of maternity care - and the return of home births?\u0026nbsp  Dr Boyd said the levels of poverty he encountered as a young medic in Edinburgh are also long gone. As a student, he spent a period assisting at home births in the Leith area with midwives.  \"That was an occasion where I was first confronted with real poverty. Some of the worst slums in Scotland were in Leith. Often there would be nowhere to put the baby except in an empty drawer, and sometimes there wasn\u0027t very much food.  \"I remember one occasion where the delivery was quite prolonged. The men vanished, of course - off to the pub or wherever - and it was either a neighbour or a female relative who was around. They\u0027d be offered a cup of tea and that was it.  \"Anyway, it was going on and on and the student midwife said \u0027I\u0027m getting really hungry\u0027. So we pooled our resources - the midwife and myself - and I went out and got fish suppers.  \"And we all - the poor mother-to-be, the attendants, myself - we all ate fish suppers. It was probably the best meal she had had in a long time.  \"I didn\u0027t come from a posh family, but I\u0027d never encountered poverty like that.  \"I shared with a very good friend of mine, another medical student, and when we came back from these places the drill was that we went straight back to our bedroom, put a newspaper down, stripped and started to look for the \u0027wildlife\u0027. There was everything: fleas, lice, bedbugs. That\u0027s something not seen nowadays.\"  Read more NHS 70: Has psychiatry gone from overcrowded asylums to a shortage of beds?\u0026nbsp  However, Dr Boyd laments the rise of a \"culture of blame\" in the NHS over the decades.  He said: \"There were difficulties then when I was younger, but there is a difference in attitude. Things went wrong in those days as well, of course, but they didn\u0027t have the climate of blame and fear of doing something wrong and being blamed and sued for it. That didn\u0027t exist.  \"Another disease you don\u0027t see now is polio myelitis. Now I can remember as a house physician admitting a young male psychiatrist from the local psychiatric hospital at Larbert, with acute polio myelitis. He progressed very rapidly to the extent that his respiratory muscles were affected.  \"Now in the 1930s Lord Nuffield - the \u0027Morris\u0027 of the Morris cars, and at that time a millionaire - he had gone round the hospitals in the UK presenting what was known as an \u0027iron lung\u0027. These were the old negative pressure respirators. It was like getting into a coffin - you were enclosed in there with a seal round the neck, and just your head exposed.  \"Well, Falkirk Royal had an iron lung. I had never had training in using it and I don\u0027t think any of the other staff had either. It was just there, ready for use, but it never had been used.  \"I remember that being a very traumatic experience, and the poor chap died afterwards. I had never seen a team of nurses cry before but we were all very distressed. That\u0027s one of the bad things I remember.  \"But nobody said \u0027why did this man die?\u0027. The attitude was from relatives \u0027thank you doctor for doing all you did\u0027. It was different.\"  Following his National Service in Nigeria, Dr Boyd worked at various hospitals including the Eastern General Hospital in Edinburgh, where he was based in the department of respiratory disease alongside Sir John Crofton, the famous pioneer of the \u0027Edinburgh Method\u0027 which helped eradicate tuberculosis.  \"He was a fantastic man,\" said Dr Boyd. \"He was not only a brilliant physician and researcher, but he was a very humane man.\"  Later, seeking a consultant post, Dr Boyd became the first ever consultant physician employed by the NHS in Caithness and Sutherland when he took up a post at Caithness Central Hospital in 1964.  He was tasked with setting up the region\u0027s first acute medical unit, which served a population of around 35,000-40,000 people. Besides Dr Boyd and his senior house officer, the staff consisted of one consultant surgeon, a consultant obstetrician, an anaesthetist and a GP.  Dr Boyd said: \"It was fine, but I found the isolation as a consultant hospital doctor something which worried me. I\u0027d always been in the situation where if there was problems you always had somebody to spark off - but there was nobody.  \"I began to think \u0027I\u0027m going to develop a God Almighty syndrome here\u0027, that everything I say is correct. I missed that contact, so I came back to Edinburgh in 1970.\"  The remainder of his career, until he retired from clinical work in 1988, was spent in the capital.  More recently, he has experienced the NHS as a patient - having coronary stents and a pacemaker fitted - but also through his granddaughter, who is a GP.  \"Her stories of pressure on beds - I don\u0027t remember that quite so much,\" said Dr Boyd. \"We were certainly busy and we worked long hours, but we enjoyed them. We didn\u0027t have the problem of the elderly so much though. Being 75 back then - you were really old. Being 91, as I am, that was unheard of.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-reconsider-rejection-of-glasgow-safe-injection-room","story":"  Council leader Susan Aitken and city convener for health and social care, Mhairi Hunter, responded to the Home Office following its refusal of the policy.  It only just preceded the announcement that Scotland has the highest drug-related death rates in Europe \u0026ndash around 30 per cent are in Glasgow.  A safer drugs consumption facility (SDCF) would help tackle the problem that killed more than 200 in the city last year, its proponents believe.  The letter to Victoria Atkins MP, Under Secretary of State for Crime, stated: \u0026ldquoWe note that other countries have successfully introduced DCRs within strict legislative frameworks similar to those that operate in the UK.  The UK Government had referred to addicts travelling from Sweden to Jutland, Denmark, to use a similar clinic.  But the councillors told how the chance of people travelling to Glasgow for the facility was unlikely due to the low income and homeless demographic that would use it.  No change to the current laws concerning supply of heroin is being sought by the council.  Special training and strict protocols will be in place for staff working in the centre.  Given the rise in drug deaths, all parties in the council are supportive of the plan.  In 2017, 934 drug-related deaths were recorded in Scotland, an eight per cent increase on 2016.  The figure is going up and up every year on average since 1997, when just 200 deaths were recorded.  The overwhelming majority are related to heroin, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Ms Hunter and Ms Aitken\u0026rsquos letter added: \u0026ldquoIn terms of day to day ethical dilemmas, clinicians employed in such a service will have considerable experience of working with drug users and will operate within their existing codes of professional practice.  \u0026ldquoWe have around 30 years of experience within Glasgow of running needle exchanges, opiate replacement therapy and outreach services to drug users, and therefore a significant body of existing knowledge, experience and transferrable skills.  At a recent council meeting, Ms Hunter said: \u0026ldquo[The letter] from the Home Office was actually a lot more positive than it might have first appeared... I think the first time we\u0026rsquove seen the Home Office acknowledge the benefits of the facility."},{"url":null,"title":"chequers-talks-cabinet-agrees-to-uk-european-union-free-trade-area-for-goods","story":"  Plans have been thrashed out by ministers and Theresa May after meeting for the day at Chequers.  The Prime Minister had summoned senior ministers to decide on the UK\u0027s future relationship with Brussels.  The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.  In a three-page document released this evening, the agreed plans state that the ministers had \"agreed to a more developed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcomprehensive proposal for\u0026nbspthe \u0026nbspeconomic partnership. \u0026nbsp  At \u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcore of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspproposal is\u0026nbspthe establishment \u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspUK\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfree\u0026nbsptrade\u0026nbsparea\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspgoods,\" it read.  Under the Government\u0027s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.  Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a \"no deal\" Brexit.  Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.  Going into Chequers the Prime Minister was under pressure as the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.  But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.  The \"common rulebook\" for goods could reduce the UK\u0027s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.  It would also involve the UK paying \"due regard\" to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister\u0027s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.  But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a \"collective position\" on the future of the negotiations with the EU.  \"Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,\" she said.  \"This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \"As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  \"We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. \"  Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.  They include:  - The UK committing to \"ongoing harmonisation\" with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland  - A \"joint institutional framework\" would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes  - A new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\"  - The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would \"control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world\"  - Free movement of people will end, but a \"mobility framework\" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other\u0027s territories and apply to study or work  Mrs May said: \"Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.\"  Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May\u0027s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.  Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis\u0027s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May\u0027s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.  Describing the plan as \"not very good at all\", Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today that it would deliver \"something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members\".  Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK \"one foot in, one foot out\" of the EU.  \"I am not a hypocrite,\" the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC\u0027s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.  \"I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.\"  And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that \"Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-defies-odds-and-secures-cabinet-deal-on-brexit-strategy","story":"  Amid talk of mass resignations, the Prime Minister performed a political high-wire act to finally agree a deal to align Britain\u0026rsquos rules with the rest of Europe on goods, including agricultural produce a move set to confound her critics and infuriate hard Brexiteers, who claimed this would make the UK a \u0026ldquovassal state of the EU.  After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible. He emerged \u0026ldquocontent with her plan.  Key now will be how Brussels reacts. Earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, said that he was ready to adapt the EU27\u0027s stance in response to any changes to the UK\u0027s \"red lines\".

They shared the secrets of their success, as well as views on the development of the news industry, with 100 young reporters from 50 countries.  Organised by the British Council in partnership with several leading media companies, Future News Worldwide aims to identify, connect and train the next generation of journalists by giving them rare access to respected international editors, broadcasters and reporters.    Last month, the BBC issued a public apology to Ms Gracie after admitting she had been told she would be paid in line with North America editor Jon Sopel, whose salary is in the \u0026pound200,000-\u0026pound250,000 range.  When she took up the job of China editor she was paid \u0026pound135,000.  Mark Wood, former editor-in-chief of Reuters and chairman of the Future News Advisory Board, said it was a privilege to have journalists of Ms Gracie\u0026rsquos calibre at the three-day conference, which ended yesterday.  \u0026ldquoFuture News Worldwide 2018 is a unique event that gives young journalists from around the world the opportunity to meet and learn from some of the most outstanding media figures of our time, he added.  \u0026ldquoAs well as focussing on high-quality, reliable journalism, they will take part in workshops that equip them to deal with all forms of digital communication.  \u0026ldquoAt a time when the demand for trustworthy news has never been greater, this conference will help plant the roots of dependable, quality journalism in countries around the world.

The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  Meanwhile a new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\".  Ms Sturgeon, who has been vocal in calling for the UK to remain part of both the European customs union and single market, said the plan had \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\" - although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  But she raised concerns about its \"sheer complexities\", and said there could still be \"massive unresolved questions about acceptability to EU\", adding that the plan \"still reads like cherry picking\".  However, she stressed: \"Perhaps key point is this - if this becomes the UK starting point in negotiations, it is surely game on for those who would prefer to see a full single market/customs union outcome.\"  The First Minister made the points in a series of tweets, also noting that it \"still remains to be seen if PM can hold her dysfunctional party together on it\".  Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs: An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\"  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas.  She said: \"The proposals agreed at Chequers are welcome and provide clarity as the UK government moves to the next round of negotiations with the EU.  \"For Scotland, they deliver in three key areas - providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  Ms Davidson added: \"There are further commitments to upholding shared high standards in goods, agriculture and the environment, which are to be welcomed.\"  The Tory hit out at Ms Sturgeon\u0027s SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Ms Davidson insisted: \"Now is the time to put differences aside. The UK is leaving the EU. On the table is a pragmatic set of proposals that go a long way to addressing the concerns of those worried about the economic impacts of a \u0027hard\u0027 Brexit.  \"An admission from the SNP that such fears have been largely addressed would help reassure Scotland\u0027s business, agri-foods and fishing communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn-pm-must-get-agreement-on-brexit-plan-or-call-general-election","story":"  The Labour leader\u0026rsquos comments came after his shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the party was not ruling out a second referendum on the terms of the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 9:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is likely that a further consultation will take place once specific options have been drawn up, giving all stakeholders a further opportunity to provide us with their views.“This means that final decisions will be made next year, rather than in September as first envisaged.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 9:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765629.1530965023!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon it s game on for keeping uk in single market","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon has declared it is \u0026#8220game on\u0026#8221 for campaigners hoping to keep the UK in the single market and the customs union after Brexit, after the Cabinet signed up to plans which could keep the UK closely tied to Brussels.                READ MORE - Cabinet agrees plans for ‘UK-EU free trade area’ at Chequers talkswindow.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            After a day of intensive discussions at Chequers, Theresa May managed to secure the agreement of her top ministerial team to proposals setting out the country’s future relationship with the European Union.            The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a “common rulebook”.Meanwhile a new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”.Ms Sturgeon, who has been vocal in calling for the UK to remain part of both the European customs union and single market, said the plan had “more realism in it than we’ve seen before from UK government” - although she added “that’s not saying much”.But she raised concerns about its “sheer complexities”, and said there could still be “massive unresolved questions about acceptability to EU”, adding that the plan “still reads like cherry picking”.However, she stressed: “Perhaps key point is this - if this becomes the UK starting point in negotiations, it is surely game on for those who would prefer to see a full single market/customs union outcome.”            The First Minister made the points in a series of tweets, also noting that it “still remains to be seen if PM can hold her dysfunctional party together on it”.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see “have the red lines been turned pink”, as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: “As with eggs: An egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas.            She said: “The proposals agreed at Chequers are welcome and provide clarity as the UK government moves to the next round of negotiations with the EU.“For Scotland, they deliver in three key areas - providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland’s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.”Ms Davidson added: “There are further commitments to upholding shared high standards in goods, agriculture and the environment, which are to be welcomed.”The Tory hit out at Ms Sturgeon’s SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had “used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart”.Ms Davidson insisted: “Now is the time to put differences aside. The UK is leaving the EU. On the table is a pragmatic set of proposals that go a long way to addressing the concerns of those worried about the economic impacts of a ‘hard’ Brexit.            “An admission from the SNP that such fears have been largely addressed would help reassure Scotland’s business, agri-foods and fishing communities.”READ MORE - Nicola Sturgeon snubbed by Donald Trump in plans for UK trip"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?

I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”.

The Global Firepower ranking for 2018 puts the UK military in sixth place, behind the US, Russia, China, India and France. And some experts suggest this ranking actually underestimates the capabilities of technologically advanced countries with Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), suggesting in 2014 that even China would be “out-matched qualitatively in a ‘straight fight’ with the UK in an equidistant location”. The UK is also one of only eight Nato countries that spend more than two per cent of GDP on defence.            So, it would appear that the UK punches more than its weight when it comes to military matters.            READ MORE: Stewart McDonald: Get defence of the north right or risk losing ScotlandHowever, it has now emerged that the number of Ministry of Defence jobs in Scotland fell by more than 12 per cent to 13,930 between 2012 and this year, with the SNP’s Maree Todd describing the cuts as “devastating” and adding that there was “barely a community that isn’t being hammered as the Tories grind down our armed forces [and] hollow out Scotland’s proud military past”. This, however, begs the question of what Scotland’s military would be like if it became an independent country.The Sustainable Growth Commission report says Scotland’s armed forces would number “around 12,600” on a pro-rata population share of the UK’s current strength, with a further civilian defence staff of less than 700. So it would appear from these two sets of figures that, despite the reduction in numbers, Scotland still has a slightly higher number of armed forces’ jobs than it would have on a pro-rata basis.Of course, as the SNP rightly points out, Scotland has a long military history and could choose to increase the number of defence jobs if it became independent.            But the Growth Commission report also forecasts several years of tough public spending choices after independence – described as “austerity” by Labour – until Scotland could catch up with the better economic performance of small countries like Denmark, New Zealand, North and Ireland.So, in those circumstances, would the public be willing to maintain an military that enables Scotland to also punch significantly above its weight? It seems unlikely.READ MORE: Scottish Government raises alarm over military bases in Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765599.1530953540!/image/image.jpg","title":"almost 2 000 scottish mod jobs have gone","story":"        The SNP yesterday condemned UK government defence cuts after official figures revealed almost 2,000 Ministry of Defence (MoD) jobs have gone from Scotland in the past six years.                Figures disclosed in an answer to a SNP freedom of information request disclosed that there has been a 12.3 per cent reduction in the MOD headcount north of the Border.            According to the data ,there were 15,880 military and civilian MoD posts north of the border in April 2012.            That had fallen to 13,930 in April this year, a reduction of 1,950 – the equivalent of 12.3 per cent.The statistics, which were provided by the MoD and broken down by local authority area, showed that South Ayrshire had lost all 100 of its military posts and was left with just 20 civilian employees. Other areas to be hit hard were Edinburgh which lost 500 military jobs and Fife, which lost 520 MoD jobs in total.The SNP warned that the situation would get worse as a result of UK government plans to reduce the military footprint in Scotland. Two years ago the UK government announced that eight military sites in Scotland would close in the 16 years, cutting the defence estate by 20 per cent.The bases earmarked for closure included famous barracks such as Fort George in the Highlands, Glencorse Barracks, near Penicuik, and Redford Cavalry Barracks and Redford Infantry Barracks in Edinburgh. Others on the list were Stirling’s Meadowforth Barracks, Naval base MoD Caledonia in Rosyth, Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh and Forthside Barracks in Stirling.The closures, which will take place over the next few years, represent a 20 per cent cut to the Scottish defence estate. They are among 56 sites which were announced for closure across the UK.             Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said: “These are devastating figures, which reveal the extent of MoD cuts upon Scotland. There’s barely a community that isn’t being hammered, as the Tories grind down our armed forces, hollow out Scotland’s proud military past and spare little thought for local communities and the jobs that depend on the military.”Scottish Conservative MP Douglas Ross said the UK government had invested heavily in defence. He said: “The SNP have conveniently forgotten that the UK government has invested heavily in defence locations across Scotland.  “You only have to look at  RAF Lossiemouth in Moray to see that. Millions of pounds and hundreds more personnel. Hardly the bleak picture the SNP want to create. The fact is that the main threat to our military capability and the jobs that depend on it is the SNP policy of Scottish independence.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765681.1530983390!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may i won t let people down on brexit","story":"        Theresa May defended the Brexit deal struck at Chequers as Downing Street stepped up efforts to win Tory Eurosceptic support for the plan that will keep the UK closely tied to Brussels.                The Prime Minister said the plan thrashed out with the Cabinet was aimed at making sure “we deliver on Brexit for the people because I won’t let people down”.            Mrs May insisted that the UK would regain control of its borders, but refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential treatment under the future immigration policy.            The Prime Minister’s inner circle is trying to secure support for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a “common rulebook”.READ MORE: It’s ‘game on’ for keeping UK in single marketCabinet Brexiteers have already been persuaded to support the plans after the marathon session of talks at Chequers on Friday, but backbench Eurosceptics have expressed grave doubts.The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK’s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week commencing July 16.            The Prime Minister told the BBC: “We’re leaving the European Union. I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.“They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.“They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and that’s exactly what we will do.“But we’ll do it in a way that protects drops and enhances our economy for the future.”            Repeatedly pressed on whether the new immigration system would offer preferential access to EU citizens, Mrs May said: “We need to look at that in the context of the wider rules we have for immigration from outside of the European Union and we will decide the rules that are right for the UK.”The Prime Minister said that “collective responsibility has returned” to the Cabinet after the Chequers deal and it was now important to get on with negotiating with the EU.“Up till now what we’ve seen from Europe are the proposals that they’ve effectively put to us of being ones that we couldn’t accept,” she said.She said there was a “willingness to sit down and talk” about the plans.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he was looking forward to the publication of the white paper and the EU would consider whether the proposals are “workable and realistic”.            As well as potentially difficult talks ahead with Brussels,  Mrs May also faces the task of winning over Eurosceptic backbenchers.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, warned that a common rulebook could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming into the UK.He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit.“An egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was “awaiting the detail” of the plans before deciding whether to support calls for a leadership contest.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.James Cleverly, a deputy chairman of the party, said: “I went in there with some concerns as a Brexiteer and I come out with those concerns addressed.”He said the briefings “will massively calm the nerves of people who have been basing their views on the speculation that has been floating around in the media and social media”.Vicky Ford urged colleagues not to get “too hot under the collar” until they had seen the details.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling acknowledged the plans could cause “issues” in future trade talks.Asked what the common rulebook with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There may be individual issues to address in future trade talks.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to Mrs May about the plans on Saturday.He said he “welcomed proposals from British Government which can input into talks on the future relationship”.“Await detail in white paper late next week before agreeing an EU position,” he said."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765607.1530960066!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish airports among those to charge extortionate parking tariffs","story":"        More than two-thirds of airports have raised their parking fees for drivers picking up friends or relatives this summer, according to new analysis.                READ MORE - Leader comment: Edinburgh airport parking charges are a rip off            Thirteen out of 19 airports have hiked their prices for car parks close to terminals that drivers can use when picking up passengers, an RAC study revealed.            The most expensive is London Luton, where it costs £8 for up to 30 minutes’ parking, researchers found.This is compared with £7 for 40 minutes last year.London Stansted in Essex is the second most expensive, with motorists charged £5.50 to park for up to half an hour, followed by Birmingham airport where the fee is £5.10 for no more than one hour.The airports have raised their prices by 50p and 20p respectively this year.Out of four airports with an initial charge of £4, Edinburgh offers the worst value as the fee only gives drivers 15 minutes of parking.            London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester all allow twice as long for the same price.The largest percentage increase in charges has been inflicted on drivers using Southampton airport.Its fee doubled from £1 to £2, although the length of stay has been extended from 10 minutes to a quarter of an hour.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis predicted that many people will be in for a nasty surprise when collecting loved ones at airports this summer.            He said: “With thousands of motorists driving to airports to pick up and drop off friends and family members, many will unfortunately find themselves shocked by some of the extortionate parking tariffs operated by some airports.“Our advice is to check parking fees and time limits well before setting out for an airport this summer so as to avoid a nasty shock.“Drivers should also be aware of just how high some charges can be if they inadvertently stay longer picking up or dropping off than they originally meant to.”A spokesman for London Luton claimed the RAC had “chosen to misrepresent facts”, stating that it offers a “set down area” where drivers can pick up or drop off passengers for a charge of £3 for 10 minutes.Free parking for various lengths of time is offered at car parks further from the terminal building.            London Luton says its parking charges are set to “manage a limited number of spaces” as its short-term car park is currently closed for the construction of a light rail link to the nearest train station and a second multi-storey car park.Parking at airports has been a controversial issue in recent months, with some holidaymakers finding their cars vandalised after parking on nearby residential streets to avoid fees.Passengers using London Luton, Manchester and Liverpool airports are among those affected.Here are the initial fees for using a car park close to airport terminal buildings to pick up passengers, according to the RAC:1.

The proposals, agreed after Theresa May summoned senior ministers to decide on plans for the future relationship with Brussels, will see the UK agree to remain in line with the EU on rules for all goods.            But under the Government’s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.            Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Going into Chequers the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.The “common rulebook” for goods could reduce the UK’s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.            It would also involve the UK paying “due regard” to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister’s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a “collective position” on the future of the negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,” she said.“This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.            “As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.“We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. “Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.They include:- The UK committing to “ongoing harmonisation” with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland            - A “joint institutional framework” would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes- A new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”- The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would “control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world”- Free movement of people will end, but a “mobility framework” will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories and apply to study or workMrs May said: “Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.“Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.”Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May’s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.Describing the plan as “not very good at all”, Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4’s Today that it would deliver “something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members”.Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK “one foot in, one foot out” of the EU.“I am not a hypocrite,” the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC’s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.“I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.”And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that “Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines”.The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the Cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.“This looks like a sticking plaster rather than the Government’s final position.“With just a matter of months of the negotiations left, Theresa May’s ability to deliver Brexit continues to be in doubt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations.

During 2017/18, more than 3,700 Highland pupils benefited from a school clothing grant.\nThe additional funding will be allocated to top up the existing rate, taking the council\u0026rsquos grant amount to \u0026pound140 per pupil.\n\"This exceeds the \u0026pound100 minimum amount agreed with the Scottish Government by \u0026pound40 from academic year 2018/19,\" a council spokesperson said today (Monday June 18).\nCouncillor Alister MacKinnon, chair of the corporate resources committee, added: \"Passing on 100% the funding from the Scottish Government for school clothing grants is the right thing to do for our school pupils.\n\"The austerity cuts continue to place many families in financial hardship and low income families in Highland.

I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSaturday 7 Jul 2018 9:43
