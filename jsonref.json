The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":null,"title":"US marine Eriq Adame passes three times skydive","story":"Share this article \u0027Hi man, here we are, we\u0027re at 3,000 feet.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

As long as he cannot return to China, the UK represents the preferred place for his family to make their home.But he added: “I don’t know anything about Britain. It is unknown territory for me. All I know is I’m so tired of superpowers after growing up in a country aspiring to be one. And the US is so backward in many ways, I just want a safe home for my son where he can be educated in English.”He said he would watch with interest how the country dealt with its political quandary. “The parliament is a circus and Boris Johnson is one of quite a few clowns out there right now. This is clearly a moment of social change the old structure needs new possibilities ... I am an outsider so I will listen to the arguments. I do think you have to trust people to make mistakes, to learn from the consequences and make improvements – that’s how the history of human development goes.”The 61-year-old, who was granted refuge in Germany four years ago after three months of prison detention followed by a lengthy house arrest in China, distanced himself from reports that he was leaving the country because it had become intolerant towards the almost 1 million refugees who arrived in 2015. He and his family had decided to move to Britain for “more prosaic” reasons such as weather and schooling, he said.“The education system will put more demands on my son than the German one, and he’s told me he needs more pressure, and both my son and girlfriend are happy to not have to face another long Berlin winter,” he said.“Basically the centre of argument has moved from me, to being one about where it is best for my son, Ai Lao, to be,” he said. “We found him a school in Cambridge and we’re lucky they accepted him. The environment is peaceful and productive, like a garden, and my son is happy.”Ai said he looked forward to getting involved in the arguments Britons were having with each other over Brexit. “The more argument there is the better for me,” he said. “I like more argument as I’m basically like a boxer, and enjoy the stimulation. I’m not someone who greets the neighbours and pretends everything is fine if it’s not. We are in the midst of a lot of conflicts in the world right now … you cannot pretend it’s not happening.”He said he would always be grateful to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for enabling him to find a safe haven in Berlin. But he said during his time there he had felt frustrated at being excluded from political and social debate, and he would remain relevant only if he was able to participate in the conversation. He speaks no German so the language barrier was a problem.“Germans think I’m a hero because I stood up to communism in China they think I’m crazy and brave. I’m not brave I just respond to things I think are wrong – whether in Germany or China. But I’ve felt a lot of resistance when I’ve tried to talk with people – including high-level German friends of mine – about uncomfortable things here, like unfriendliness to foreigners. They have warned me that people don’t like you to talk about those controversial issues. They told me, ‘They expect you to concentrate on being an artist.’ But I can’t do that, I will not stay in a certain box – in China, in Germany or in the UK.”He has enjoyed an array of stellar shows of his works, most recently in Düsseldorf, his largest in Europe to date, since moving to Germany. But a number of controversies had added extra, unwanted frisson to his stay, he said. A legal dispute with Volkswagen, which used one of his refugee-themed artworks as a backdrop for an ad campaign, led to the carmaker having to pay him €230,000 (£205,000) in compensation.The films The Rest, his documentary on refugees in Europe, as well as Ai Weiwei: Yours Truly, Cheryl Haines’s account of his exhibition on the prison island of Alcatraz, and Beijing Spring, about a Chinese artist community to which he belonged, were not chosen for the festival, which prides itself on its political content. “Fine, I think to myself. Maybe they don’t like it. But it’s not just my films – others critical of China’s history and past were turned down too,” Ai said.The Berlinale denies the accusation, but Ai is convinced the reason is “none of them were going to receive China’s golden seal of approval. And no one wants to get on the wrong side of China.”That followed an earlier decision by the French director Emmanuel Benbihy to cut Ai and his son, now aged 10, out of Berlin, I Love You, the latest instalment of the Cities in Love series celebrating cities around the world, this one starring Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley and Jim Sturgess. Benbihy complained that Ai’s two-minute scene was “too political”, which the artist said this was further proof that he was now considered a “liability”.The artist was speaking in his subterranean studio in eastern Berlin, a 4,000 sq m catacomb, 10 metres below ground, before the opening of Roots, his latest exhibition in the city at the neugerriemschneider gallery, a version of which will be shown at Lisson Gallery in London from October.At its heart are seven large iron sculptures based on wax casts from trees native to the Brazilian rainforests, inspired by a poem by his father, Ai Qing, and visits the artist made to the forests.He said he could see the parallels between the destruction caused by rampant capitalism in Brazil and the attempts by Chinese authorities to crush the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which he was following closely via contacts on the ground, including his own team of film-makers, and social media. “Those campaigning against these destructive forces are courageous and clever, but I fear they are very fragile compared to what they are up against.”Ai has yet to have an official meeting with Merkel – only bumping into her by chance at a Chinese restaurant near her flat – but said he planned to write to thank her and explain his decision to leave. “I understand she couldn’t meet me, because she has to consider Germany’s dealings with China,” he said, noting she has travelled there 12 times during her chancellery.“But she’s the first person I want to show my gratitude towards, because she helped with my release. Even if she’s being practical and shoring up Germany’s future by keeping good relations with China, she has the integrity to put a public issue – like Hong Kong or the refugees – in front of the world, and for that we really are very grateful.”Despite his latest show being described as a “monumental final greeting” to Berlin by one art critic, Ai insisted he was not turning his back on the city. He will retain a strong presence in the form of his team and his studio – he has a 99-year lease on the building. “Berlin will always be one of my bases. I will keep coming back,” he said.He remains hopeful that one day he and his family will be able to travel back to China. “My son is so interested in it. He knows I am missing China, and went back once to my studio and held my cats for me for half an hour. He wanted to do that for me. I have often taken him with me, to Brazil or Mexico, often dangerous places, sometimes to parties. But he’s so tired of my art, my propaganda. He once said to me, ‘No more Ai Weiwei.’”Ten days in the UK led him to believe British food was “disastrous: there are so few fruits and vegetables, maybe because people start drinking in the morning”.

He felt a “deep sense of remorse” at helping bring the man who would become president gain wider attention. Andrew O’Hagan famously detailed the extraordinary details of ghosting Julian Assange’s memoir, including watching the WikiLeaks founder eat jam pudding with his hands, before the latter backed out of a £600,000 book deal. This week, the writer Natalie Beach joined the grand tradition of ghostwriters speaking out about their subjects, with a deeply intimate essay in the Cut laying out how she used to ghost everything for her former friend and controversial “influencer” Caroline Calloway: from Instagram captions to the aborted book that once attracted a $375,000 (£300,000) publishing deal, until their relationship broke down irretrievably.Beach’s account says that after the pair put the book proposal together, the influencer felt unable to write it. Beach says she “bought us time with the publishers by writing a quarter of the manuscript by myself”.With Calloway now obsessively responding on Instagram to Beach’s essay, and as the internet picks over the details of the story – you can find out if you’re more of a Caroline or a Natalie in the inevitable Buzzfeed quiz – the bestselling ghostwriter Andrew Crofts ponders if it had all been planned.“Is it a car crash, or have they achieved exactly what they want to achieve?” he asks. “It’s all very Tom RipleyDickie Greenleaf. That’s what’s intriguing.”As a ghostwriter himself, Crofts questions the ethics of speaking out about his subjects’ lives. “I do think Tony Schwartz shouldn’t have come out and said anything about Trump, because you’ve taken the money. It’s like a lawyer: if you find that the person you’re representing is a murderer you can’t then go around bewailing the fact you defended them – that was your job,” he said. “But I think he made Trump, I don’t think Trump would be president if he hadn’t written that book for him, because he’d never have got The Apprentice without the book, and the presidency without The Apprentice. So it must be weighing heavily on his conscience.”With more than 80 books behind him, a dozen of which were No 1 bestsellers, Crofts can only recall having to sever ties with one subject himself. “He was an elderly gentleman, and I remember him coming out of the shower naked,” he says. “He had all the photographs for the book spread out on the floor and they were sticking to his feet, and I thought: ‘It’s time to go.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

Accordingly, the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement.”In a letter to HKEX’s chairwoman, Laura Cha, and its chief executive, Charles Li, the LSEG chairman, Don Robert, also indicated that the company’s connections to the Hong Kong government meant any deal would face difficulties in gaining approval. Almost half of HKEX’S board is appointed by the Hong Kong government, which in recent weeks has been struggling in the face of a string of protests.Robert wrote: “There is no doubt that your unusual board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters. Accordingly, your assertion that implementation of a transaction would be ‘swift and certain’ is simply not credible.“On the contrary, we judge that the approval processes would be exhaustive and that support from relevant parties, vital for the transaction, is highly uncertain. This would pose serious risk for our shareholders.”Chinese companies have made 15 big acquisitions in the UK so far this year, spending £6.75bn – already more than the $6bn spent on 23 deals last year. Many analysts point to the decline in the pound since the EU referendum for making UK companies look more attractive to overseas buyers.Li said earlier this week that the Hong Kong exchange was not a Chinese company and pointed to the fact that seven years ago HKEX had bought the London Metal Exchange, the centre for global metals trading, in a deal that transformed the group into a global player.The approach also came weeks after the LSEG unveiled its own global expansion plan with a $27bn (£22bn) deal to take control of Refinitiv, a financial data business that supplies information screens used on bank trading floors worldwide.The LSE agreed that deal in an attempt to become a UK-headquartered global rival to the billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s financial news and data business. HKEX, whose largest shareholder is the Hong Kong government, is hoping to derail that deal and take control of the London Stock Exchange.Since 2000, the LSE has been the target of seven proposed takeovers or mergers and all have failed. The last was in 2017, when a £21bn merger with German rival Deutsche Börse was blocked by the European commission.HKEX declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b68c28e05952ad409fb47c18ffbbd072c9b4042/0_148_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb27c31d2c1c30cf8b8406554795b75","title":"tone deaf ads use slave ship images to promote uk sea trade","story":"Campaign accused of ignoring colonial abuses when setting out maritime industries’ futureHistorians and academics have labelled a new government campaign “tone deaf” and “historically illiterate” for using images of ships used for slavery and colonisation to promote Britain’s maritime sector.The advertisement by the Department for Transport features ships such as fluyts, the East Indiaman and the steamship, which were used between the 16th and 19th centuries to establish the British Empire, transport slaves and indentured labourers across the Atlantic and bring hauls of valuable goods to Britain.“This is what happens when the historical memory is limited to a narrative in which we simply abolished slavery – it is remarkably tone-deaf, never mind historically illiterate,” said Kim Wagner, historian and author.Britain’s commercial shipping enterprise in this period dismantled a thriving Indian ocean exchange of goods and services between the east and west and replaced it with a system in which trade was primarily beneficial to the western world, historian Vinita Damodaran said. “The trade significantly changed. The British ships were no longer carrying fine muslins and calico to Europe. The primary produce brought over was jute, cotton, the sorts of materials used in the emerging British industrial project.”Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches at the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said that Britain’s history of commercial shipping was “a deeply violent one, which included shipping millions of black and indentured bodies tightly packed in the holds of ships to be exploited on plantations.”“It is shameful to not acknowledge this in favour of a diffuse and dishonest pride,” Gopal said.“It is a reflection of the pervasive ignorance that goes hand in hand with Empire nostalgia” Wagner said.The Department for Transport did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948ad0a2ebe6d931d8827ea89ac184986af76c1b/0_22_1313_788/master/1313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306caf54e16c85fc1d3f595eb7213881","title":"reclaimed lakes and giant airports how mexico city might have looked","story":"The Mexican capital was founded by Aztecs on an island in a vast lake. No wonder water flows through so many of its unbuilt projectsEver since Mexico City was founded on an island in the lake of Texcoco its inhabitants have dreamed of water: containing it, draining it and now retaining it.Nezahualcoyotl, the illustrious lord of Texcoco, made his name constructing a dyke shielding Mexico City’s Aztec predecessor city of Tenochtitlan from flooding. The gravest threat to Mexico City’s existence came from a five-year flood starting in 1629, almost causing the city to be abandoned. Ironically now its surrounding lake system has been drained, the greatest threat to the city’s existence is probably the rapid decline of its overstressed aquifers.No wonder water flows through many of Mexico’s City’s unbuilt projects.The first plan to eliminate the city’s lakes while preserving canals and reservoirs for transport and irrigation was proposed by council member Francisco Gudiel in the 16th century. Gudiel’s vision was nixed by a city council unwilling to contribute the necessary funds. The lakes remained for a couple more centuries, disappearing just when the car came on the scene in the early 20th century. When they were finally drained no water was left for irrigation or transport and the city became a rapidly expanding maze of concrete, swamped with motor traffic.A ring road surrounding a grid of streets has been a central vision for Mexico City since the first modern urban development plan by Carlos Contreras in 1933. One proposal in this vein from Mexico’s ministry of works in 1967 would have heavily impacted the city’s urban landscape with a double ring road surrounding the city’s historic centre, one clockwise and one counterclockwise. Areas such as the Tepito and Merced neighbourhoods would have been filled with high-rise social housing for 80,000 people and high-value commerce. The plan disappeared silently when Mexico was engulfed by student protests in 1968.A 1970 project from the ministry of works, called Aztlan 2000, envisioned the construction of a social housing complex for 1.5 million inhabitants in the city’s northern periphery to accommodate the masses of new migrants coming to the booming megalopolis. The plan integrated housing, malls, a racetrack, hospitals, a zoo, a golf course, a stadium, a subway and a museum, among other amenities. None of these were built and the population of the city’s peripheries rocketed from 591,000 in 1960 to 7.3 million in 1990, largely driven by informal growth.A 2009 project that might have addressed the dearth of services in Mexico City’s periphery was a cross-shaped annex to the prestigious Rufino Tamayo museum for the Atizapan district by Mexican architect Michel Rojkind and Denmark’s Bjarke Ingels Group. The municipality never transferred the land required for the project.The most sweeping proposal to return Mexico City to its lake-based origins came from Futuro Desarrollo Urbano, a group of high-profile Mexican architects headed by Alberto Kalach. Their long-running Ciudad Futura proposal called for the construction of a new urban development in the area of the old lake of Texcoco. Treated wastewater was to be used to flood approximately 12,000 hectares of former lakebed. A new city would then be built on the banks of the lake with islands linked to the shore by causeways. The project was intended to kickstart the urban development of Mexico City’s impoverished eastern districts with the creation of 80km of lakefront.Kalach’s project hinged on financing generated by the construction of an airport but when different Mexican governments undertook to build airports in 2001 and 2015 Futuro Desarrollo Urbano’s participation was not considered. Both times the airport projects were cancelled, the first because of fierce resistance from local campesinos and the second because of a change in government, cost over-runs and environmental concerns.The grid of wide avenues called ejes has been an important source of urban blight, with traffic racing past depressed shops and disjointed housing. Another project from Romero proposed a partial solution by creatinga cultural corridor, commercial corridor and High Line-style park over Chapultepec Avenue. The 2015 proposal sparked accusations of gentrification and commercialisation, and the plans were cancelled after a referendum called by the city government.As well as the disappearance of Mexico City’s lakes, many rivers and creeks have gone too, culverted and concreted over to reduce flooding and create space for more roads. A 2016 project by Elias Cattán of architectural bureau Taller 13 aimed to reinstate the Rio de la Piedad, which currently lies under one of the city’s main inner ring roads, Viaducto. Cattan’s plan envisioned putting the freeway in a tunnel under the river, and building a linear park on the banks of the resurrected stream.While the Rio de la Piedad project has failed to find backing, the newly elected mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has recently announced her intention to start recovering some of the city’s waterways.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ffaa8132510dca1da6be46990384efa4878f79/0_76_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461d83089fec81e6f0282f8e6747728f","title":"integration racism assimilation britain heritage","story":"Assimilation is an invidious concept. No one in Britain should have to give up their heritage to fit inI will never forget the day I joined an English Defence League march in Chelmsford, Essex, in the run-up to the Brexit vote. I went as a journalist, and I wasn’t expecting it to be a comfortable experience. But the most shocking moment was not what I predicted. Instead of threatening me with directly racist slurs, a senior figure at the march told me he wasn’t fussed by my presence. “You’re OK,” he said. “You speak English properly. You know our ways. You’re like us. It’s the others we have a problem with.”By “others”, he meant Muslims – the EDL’s most frequent target – or any other visible minorities he deemed to have made insufficient effort to assimilate into British culture. It struck me as the most chilling and insidious form of racism of all: he was, in effect, saying, “People who come to England are acceptable to the extent they attempt to mimic us.” Underpinning that is a confidence in one culture’s inherent superiority over others. It’s for exactly this reason that it is becoming more widely recognised that assimilationist thinking – the idea that a particular culture is preferable, and that others should therefore adopt it – is a racist ideology. “Integration is not assimilation,” said the UK’s most senior counterterrorism officer, Neil Basu, this week. Basu was pointing out that the latest research on terrorism shows that people with extremist views are moved to violence not because they aren’t “assimilated” but because they feel excluded. “Create a sense of belonging, while not forcing people to give up things they may hold as sacred,” Basu rightly recommended. “If we fail … we risk social exclusion turning to violence.” But too many people who profess their support for integration are really talking about assimilation.The pressure to downplay your culture, your identity or your pride in your heritage to gain the approval of the majority around you risks further excluding people. Yet it is a pressure many of us recognise. Earlier this week I hosted a public conversation with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, where we talked of our common experience in embracing mispronunciations of our names to make lives easier. His “Sad-eeq” is really meant to be pronounced “Saad-iq”. My “Afua” is really meant to be pronounced “Ef-wa”. We have both embraced a version others in this society find less onerous to grasp.Khan himself is clear on the difference between assimilation and integration. He sees integration as about encouraging meaningful interactions not just between people of different ethnicities, but also different ages, social classes, sexual orientations and abilities.This is something all governments should take more seriously. But the question is, how much can be done against a backdrop of cuts to the kinds of cultural activities and community services that have naturally facilitated integration for decades?The 2016 London mayoral campaign was a case study in how deliberately promoting segregation and ision can still be a mainstream political tactic. Khan’s Conservative challenger, Zac Goldsmith, ran a campaign that even other Tories acknowledge was isive and racist in its attempts to spread distrust of Khan because of his Pakistani heritage. It was the idea of his strategist, Lynton Crosby. Yet at the very moment Khan was being inaugurated as mayor, Crosby was being knighted in David Cameron’s honours list.It may be naive to hope for a more sophisticated discourse on integration when we have a prime minister who is comfortable with using racist and degrading language. But the root causes that motivated some people to vote for Brexit – feelings of social exclusion, of not being at home in one’s community, of rising levels of inequality and of feeling left behind – are reminders that creating a cohesive society is not an optional luxury. And if we fall into the trap of old-fashioned assimilationist thinking, we will continue to create more problems than we solve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ea760134695ab6dd3166563bcf5d5157a57f516/0_131_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8143fa294aee552ae667f4ebeb4c7029","title":"tories duty free government no deal advertising booze","story":"Now wanted north of the border for a prorogation scam, prime minister Boris Johnson went on the run this week with a series of alarming public appearances. Tuesday found him in a primary school, as per the timeworn political practice of ministers using inappropriate venues as backdrops. You know the sort of thing: “It’s great to come to this wonderful early years centre and announce 10 new active nuclear warheads, each capable of snuffing out 300,000 human futures in an instant.”Wow. Look, I know Prime Ministers Say the Darnedest Things. But maybe the best way to stop no deal is to put a call in to Oxford and explain they need to retroactively award Johnson a first-class degree? Just claim there was a marking error or something. Having read the Yellowhammer documents forecasting shortages, pretty much any gambit is justifiable at this point in the interests of public safety. Giving the prime minister a belated first would just be the classics department version of a cop shouting at Raoul Moat: “It’s fine, mate! I know you didn’t mean to hurt her! Nobody’s going back to prison. Just put the gun down and we can talk.”And so to another week in getting everything you always wanted. Johnson began with a horror show in the House of Commons, where his election offer to Jeremy Corbyn amounts to “Give me another series, you shit.” At least by glowering on the front bench and shaking his jowls and shouting, “Oh yes!” at Corbyn, Boris Johnson finally resembled Churchill. Unfortunately, the insurance dog version.He ended the week even more clumsily, after some Downing Street genius let it be known that the DUP had shifted their red lines in a way that could lead to a deal. Have they? Not according to adorable DUP leader Arlene Foster, who denied it and declared ominously: “Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories”, which sounds like the sort of coded message you might rasp down a telephone with a hanky over the receiver. Fair warning’s fair warning. As for whoever briefed this story, it’s all very well being the third hardest spad in No 10, and I’m sure Arlene will take your Call of Duty score into account when discussing the leak. But babe: you’re not really in the same weight ision as the DUP guys, even if you did both wear combat trousers in the 1990s.Others suspect that what will really be on offer when parliament returns is Meaningful Vote 4 – set to displace Jaws IV: The Revenge as the worst fourth iteration of a franchise ever. The latter at least gave us one of the great Michael Caine quotes. “I have never seen it,” said its leading man. “By all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.”Keen to build something other than resentment himself, Johnson spent the rest of the week promising a hardware bonanza. As always when he runs out of road, he suggested a bridge, followed by a promise to “bring shipbuilding home” with five new frigates. Maybe he could send a frigate round to the courts to stop domestic violence survivors being cross-examined by their abusers? Because thanks to his rogue prorogue, the domestic abuse bill is now back to square one. The only upside to suspending parliament has been the social damage done to Jacob Rees-Mogg. Not two months ago, that appalling old Hyacinth Bucket swept into office issuing naff decrees on the minutiae of how to address envelopes. He has now committed the somewhat greater faux pas of bullshitting the Queen.That this is all set against a backdrop of an advertising blitz gives the UK the feel of a Paul Verhoeven satire set in the near dystopian future. There’s “GET READY FOR BREXIT”. There’s “BE ONE OF THE 20,000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS”. But my favourite is the Treasury campaign, where animated booze glasses trilled the news that: “Beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes will all be duty free for people travelling to the EU if we leave without a deal.” You might be reminded of those Conservative ads a few years back, which said the government was “cutting the bingo tax and beer duty, to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy”. Those ads had their critics, but I admire the consistency and the realism, as the Conservatives continue to promote the notion that alcoholism and gambling addiction represent the smart choices for anyone governed by them.In fact, these government-backed reminders to drink early and often fuel the same sense of deep optimism as that moment in the Chernobyl drama when the new recruit to the dogshooting unit turns up to the camp and sees endless stacked pallets of empty vodka bottles. When any government – Soviet or modern British – is pushing cheap booze on you, you’ve got to think you’ve landed on your feet. Haven’t you?The alternative view, I suppose, is that government-advised inebriation and respiratory disease feels the next logical step of the Brexit shambles. “Prorogation” and “justiciability” and “stymying” and “fiat” – no one’s really sure precisely what these words mean, other than they weren’t in the brochure for the sunlit uplands. Still, don’t put your hand up and ask questions.

It took courage, “and not just political courage – people in Texas have a lot of guns”.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang talked about his father, an immigrant who “grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor, and now his son is running for president” – a comment that prompted Colbert to launch a faux auction called the “humble background games”. “Can anyone here tonight beat no floor, peanut farm?” Colbert said. “The bidding starts at slept in a bucket behind a cockfight.”After three hours soundbites, carefully crafted background stories, Biden gaffes, Colbert had to ask: “What did we get? Ten candidates, four moderators, three hours, two languages and hopefully one person who can beat Donald Trump.”On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to many of the same moments from Thursday’s Democratic debate. “Bernie with a diminished voice is just not the same, man,” said Noah on Sanders’s uncleared throat. “It’s like Luke Skywalker but with a butter knife.”Most of the candidates seemed to be on the same page with gun reform. O’Rourke, whose home town faced a deadly mass shooting just a month ago, came out particularly strong with a promise to require assault weapon buy-backs. The promise was “a ballsy statement”, said Noah. “And he said it with such confidence as well – which is not the way I’d talk about taking away assault rifles from people who like to shoot.”On immigration, the candidates discussed how they plan to undo Trump’s policies – a platform Noah described as “no more kids in cages, increased legal immigration, give everyone free ladders to climb over the wall”.Biden was asked point-blank if he thought Obama’s immigration policies, under which 3 million people were deported, were a mistake. “The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,” Biden replied. When the moderator countered “What about you?” Biden shifted responsibility with: “I’m the vice-president of the United States.”“That was not a good look for Biden,” Noah commented, “because this always happens, right? When Obama’s being praised, Biden jumps into the picture with him, but then when Obama’s being criticized Biden’s like, look man, I was the vice-president – I didn’t do shit.”The Democratic debate featured 10 candidates, “all of whom tried to stand out and avoid being eliminated under extreme time pressure in a televised event that was in no way at all like a gameshow,” said Jimmy Kimmel, because, as he noted: “This is democracy – it’s very serious. Now let’s put 45 seconds on the clock and go.”For starters, “Bernie made a strong argument tonight for giving every American access to affordable throat lozenges,” joked Kimmel, who likened Sanders’s scratchy tirades against American healthcare spending to keeping “his turn signal on for an hour and a half”.Kimmel then turned to Yang, who promised to give his “freedom idend” of $1,000 a month for a year to 10 random families who signed up on his website. “That might be the most ridiculous proposal I’ve ever seen on this network, and I’ve watched every episode of The Bachelorette,” Kimmel said.All in all, Kimmel concluded, “I don’t know who ‘won’ the debate, but watching candidates discuss the issues using real facts – I’ve forgotten what it was like. It was like walking out of North Korea and into a Costco.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d7be25577f8da4dee563e385c4333bc8871bd9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62929d1c1fdfbdb9b9e2f886d5400bb0","title":"canvas of lies what dominic cummings dress sense tells us about brexit","story":"From his quilted gilet and tote bags to his crumpled shirts and hoodie, Cummings’ look is as chaotic and misguided as the no deal Brexit he is determined to realiseDominic Cummings might be best known for being found in contempt of parliament and masterminding its prorogation. But his most egregious act is possibly wearing – day-in, day-out – a gilet.French for vest, this item of clothing would seem to be the extremely Europhobic Cummings’ sartorial bread and butter. He is rarely seen not wearing one – or without the minutes for a covert plan to undermine democracy.Cummings’ style has caught the eye of politicos, which some dismiss as a trivial matter. But in the political arena, image matters. Margaret Thatcher’s 80s power suits were scrutinised David Cameron’s switching of his parting was national news (Cameron later nominated his barber for an MBE) and eyebrows were raised at Theresa May’s favourite and incongruous Frida Kahlo bracelet.With Cummings, analysis of his clothing also acts as a knowledge gap-filler, because the man seemingly running the country is an enigma. We must mine each aspect of his character for clues as to what’s next. Sure, Cummings has a blog (now dormant) – and I’m not going to say it doesn’t have some clever ideas – but it also reads as though he went to a lot of evening classes at Alain de Botton’s The School of Life.In the 19th century, a gilet was more frequently an embroidered waistcoat and closer to a jerkin (a close-fitting open vest popular in the 16th century). Nowadays, it is a versatile garment: a sporty, padded body-warmer made popular by snowboarders a reversible combination of suede and shearling for late-morning coffees or school runs or the rabbit fur that Sienna Miller teamed with Ugg boots and every single festival between 2002 and 2004, AKA the era of boho.Cummings reminds me of Brain from Steven Spielberg’s Pinky and the Brain. This isn’t based on the fact he is bald. Many people are bald. It is because of the lightbulb shape of his skull, his pointy ears and popping eyes, and the fact that his ambition is the same as Brain’s: taking over the world.Very occasionally, Brain wears a suit when plotting. In 2001, when he was campaign director at Business for Sterling, Cummings wore a suit. Floppy but thinning hair, hands jauntily in his pockets – and in another shot, a cigarette languidly between his fingers – the vibe is very “author photograph on the inside jacket of a self-published novel”.The shirt is open-necked. It has stayed open-necked since, but these days Cummings wears his shirts with more heavage (male cleavage) on show. His signature twist is to rock a collar with one side tucked and the other not, embracing the asymmetrical trend exemplified by the much talked about Ksenia Schnaider jeans. At least Cummings’ shirts are mostly white, which, I used to think, was a classic staple difficult to get wrong. Except it is unclear whether Cummings owns an iron (perhaps too much a signifier of rich remainers). Mostly, he wears his shirts spilling over his jeans, apart from when he once tucked it in with a brown belt, which did not do its job, revealing the evil genius’s black boxers in a look more commonly seen in a drill video than on the steps of No 10.When going casual, Cummings favours shapeless T-shirts in block colours with obscure logos. You might think nothing much can be gleaned from Cummings’ old tees, except one of these logos looks a little like a wigwam emitting a signal. Further research reveals that it is the logo of Sci Foo camp, described as an “unconference” for emerging technology and scientific ideas. Unconference. Classic Dom. (The camps are held annually at the Googleplex in California.) Take his shoes off and this could be a Steve Hilton look.Also: tote bags. Cummings loves a tote. He carries around a Vote Leave-branded one in the manner of someone who went to Daunt, once. It’s from 2016, of course, this canvas of lies, which means it could probably be sold as vintage for £30 in a Hackney pop-up. He has also been spotted with a tote-with-a-quote: “It was nine-thirty on Christmas Eve …” The opening line of Susan Hill’s Woman in Black a 1983 Gothic-inspired horror novel. Gothic-inspired horror doesn’t seem too far away from where we currently are.Other accessories include a pen behind the ear black square-framed glasses (think Colin Firth in Tom Ford’s A Single Man) and an ever-present lanyard, presumably holding the parliamentary pass he should never have been granted.Perhaps the gilet jokes have become a little too much for Cummings, however, who this week was spotted in a departure piece: a grey Levi’s hoodie. This is a 90s skateboarder staple or an ex-boyfriend’s garment that is frequently worn by women around the house or for casual Sunday roasts, drawstrings pulled tight. Of course, Cummings made it weird by shoulder-robing it.Is this new wardrobe addition a sign that the often implosive, sweary Cummings (spotted recently stalking the halls of the palace with a red wine) will take a more casual approach to his career? Almost certainly not, as the country struggles through an apparently endless constitutional crisis or heads to a general election. We await with baited breath the clues to come from further tote and tee logos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c58c52e1a7d5880597147c763111ec2ff5ea61/0_0_3779_4723/master/3779.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f67aefbaa266a11f52c0e2670c33909 1010w","title":"100 best films movies of the 21st century","story":"Gangsters, superheroes, schoolkids, lovers, slaves, peasants, techies, Tenenbaums and freefalling astronauts – they’re all here in our countdown of cinema’s best movies since 2000by  Peter Bradshaw,  Cath Clarke,  Andrew Pulver and  Catherine ShoardQuentin Tarantino’s latest jaw-dropper bumps Kill Bill: Vol 1 off the list in gloriously irreverent fashion.

The film’s climax is the massacre of Palestinian refugees by Christian Phalangists at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. CC Read the reviewA sprawling drama that functions both as an excoriating treatise on the nature of poverty in Lebanon, and an idiosyncratic drama in which a child takes his parents to court for their ill-treatment of him.

But no, there’s a mobile phone. OK, a flip-phone, but this is modern rural Italy. Well, the first half, anyway. After that, it’s complicated, with a flight into magic realism or perhaps even reincarnation.

A what-if feminist parable, this is a movie that thinks the unthinkable: what if a mother doesn’t like her child, or even love him? And the casting is killer, with Ezra Miller as Kevin and Tilda Swinton playing the mother. It’s a bruising watch, but Ramsay makes it’s impossible to turn away. CC Read the reviewMalian director Abderrahmane Sissako won a lot of admirers for this slow-burn study of life in a west African town. Returning to Mauritania, his country of birth, Sissako puts together a string of vignettes and encounters, linked together by a returning, westernised student who can barely remember the local language. AP Read the reviewJoanna Hogg’s belated international breakthrough is a story of extraordinary specificity – young Hogg has disastrous affair while living in Knightsbridge and studying as a film student in the early 1980s – with rare cut-through and relatability. Honor Swinton Byrne is astonishing in her first film Tom Burke inch-perfect as the charming but parasitic older man. CS Read the reviewSeth MacFarlane’s brief ascent to the Hollywood firmament was down to this scabrously funny talking-bear farce, which helped reinvent the grossout comedy. Mark Wahlberg is great as the straight man to the foul-mouthed toy of the title, with Mila Kunis as his censorious fiancee. MacFarlane’s creation was simultaneously endearing and outrageous. AP Read the reviewMammoth two-part Indian crime film that’s a long, long way from Bollywood. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, this is conceived on a giant scale, as generations of three gangster families fight for supremacy over the course of half a century. Stylish, visceral film-making, violent and hard-hitting, it’s got a valid claim to be India’s answer to The Godfather. AP Read the reviewAndrea Arnold tossed out the costume drama rulebook with her raw, passionate retelling of Emily Brontë’s novel. I’d argue the case for Wuthering Heights as one of the most criminally underrated movies of recent years – though it’s been influential, blazing a trail for stripped-back period movies such as Lady Macbeth. Arnold was an early adopter of inclusive casting, too, giving the role of Heathcliff to black actor James Howson. CC Read the reviewIt took Winter’s Bone’s Debra Granik eight years to get this off the ground, but was worth the wait: a brilliantly moving eco drama with Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie as a father and daughter living off grid in an Oregon forest, but whose relationship and priorities are changed as the child begins the transition to adulthood. AP Read the reviewRelegated to telly in the US, Steven Soderbergh’s wondrously funny and lavish Liberace biopic had a cinema release in the UK. Michael Douglas cast vanity aside and caution to the wind with virtuosic results as the promiscuous ivories-tickler Matt Damon was terrific against type as his lover, Rob Lowe pinched and uproarious as their much-employed cosmetic surgeon. CS Read the reviewGroundbreaking single-shot paean to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from Russian director Alexander Sokurov. Exploiting then newly developed video technology, Sokurov crafted an elaborately choreographed procession of tableaux and set pieces that explored three centuries of Russian history and culture, from the imperial era to the wartime siege of Leningrad. AP Read the reviewAfter the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the treachery and backstabbery in Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher’s Facebook origin tale looks positively quaint – the geeks and nerds fighting over who had the idea for Facebook first. Nevertheless, this is still an outrageously watchable hatchet job. Jesse Eisenberg is a knockout Mark Zuckerberg, the smartest guy in the room (though not sartorially, in flip-flops and a hoodie). CC Read the reviewA beautifully shot observational documentary about the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean: the lethally dangerous boats that carry refugees from Africa and end up on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Shot by director Gianfranco Rosi with an evocative lyricism that sits in counterpoint to the blazing anger at the film’s heart. AP Read the reviewA film that grabs you by the neck and shakes hard, this brutal crime drama announced the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu as a major new talent in 2000. (And lumbered him for the while with the label “Mexico’s Tarantino”.) A film of mayhem and fury, three stories intersect around a car crash in which one of the passengers is a champion fighting dog. CC Read the reviewWestern audiences unfamiliar with the wuxia martial arts genre had never seen anything like Ang Lee’s dazzling 18th-century-set epic in 2000 – fighters flying through the air with balletic grace.

CC Read the reviewIn Richard Linklater’s gorgeous, romantic Before Sunrise, a pair of twentysomethings (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) spent the day together in Vienna. Here in the second movie when they meet again in Paris for another brief encounter, they are in their 30s. So the questions are for grownups. Am I with the right person? Where did my life go? It also has the best line ever about being in a couple with small children: “I feel like I’m running a small nursery with someone I used to date.” CC Read the reviewMichael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan’s truth-tickling hit a high note with this joyful sorta-biopic of the record label boss and broadcaster Tony Wilson. Playful, ingenious and prodigiously informative, it’s a triumph of vision over verite. It’s also a total blast.

AP Read the reviewHere’s another dark American tale from Manchester by the Sea writer-director Kenneth Lonergan (Margaret was completed in 2007 but only released in 2011 after a wrangle with the studio). Set in post 911 New York, Anna Paquin is an overentitled teenager partly responsible for a tragic accident. As in Manchester by the Sea, the effect is shattering it is like watching actual lives fall apart. CC Read the reviewArguably Penélope Cruz’s finest performance, in one of Pedro Almodóvar’s key films: a heady stew of murder, family strife and supernatural shenanigans. Cruz plays a woman forced to kill and bury her ex-husband, while her dead mother appears to be haunting her hairdresser sister. All is resolved after various traumas are lanced. AP Read the reviewIntense, anger-driven documentary from Ava DuVernay on the racialisation of the US’s justice system, positing the idea that the massively disproportionate incarceration of African-American men is simply slavery by another name. With a title referring to the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery, DuVernay suggests that privatised prisons, cheap labour and light-touch capitalism are all in it together. Tough stuff. AP Read the reviewA knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don’t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It’s the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra Hüller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie. CC Read the reviewPossibly the most fun anyone’s had at the cinema so far this century, Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street ought to be a cautionary tale. It’s based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in 1999 for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the reviewThe film whose Palme d’Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema. A young woman, helped by her friend, arranges an illegal abortion in the late 80s the squalid events that follow parallel the decay and chaos of the country as the communist dictatorship began to collapse. Harrowing but clear-sighted. AP Read the reviewThe Handmaiden is one of cinema’s great literary adaptations: Park Chan-wook transposes Sarah Waters’s crime novel Fingersmith from Victorian London to Korea in the 1930s. In this most twisted of love stories, a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) poses as maid to a wealthy heiress (Kim Min-hee). But who is the double-crosser? Depending on your tastes, a candidate for sexiest film of the century. CC Read the reviewAt the age of 47, after a career directing TV soaps such as Casualty and EastEnders, Joanna Hogg reinvented herself as auteur of a new breed of cinema. In her feature debut, Unrelated, Kathryn Worth played a fortyish woman holidaying in Tuscany with two dysfunctional families and flirting outrageously with one of the lads (Tom Hiddleston in his first movie). A cinema of awkwardness, wielding a scalpel on the well-to-do middle classes, was born. CC Read the reviewKelly Reichardt is a master of slow cinema, the maker of films about American outsiders, living without a safety net. Meek’s Cutoff is a western set in 1840s Oregon, following three families on the wagon train west. Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt’s focus, as is customary for her, is on the women – a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the reviewHere’s a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan – the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It’s set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it’s a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the reviewLars von Trier’s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur’s masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier’s use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the reviewThe film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a orce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi’s desperately painful family drama. Farhadi’s superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences.

Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who’s to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” CC Read the reviewIf we are living through a golden age of space movies, here’s where it started, Alfonso Cuarón’s spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the reviewCharlie Kaufman’s existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same – except for Jennifer Jason Leigh’s scarred sales agent. “What is it to be human?” asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). “To ache?” Few films try to answer: this Fabergé egg of a film does. CS Read the reviewThe hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev’s anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of “reawakening the soul of the Russian people” as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the reviewBruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte. Alexander Payne’s black-and-white ode to small-town America is his best this century (Sideways has not aged like a fine wine). It also features June Squibb being completely filthy. CS Read the reviewTerrence Malick’s return to cinema six years after The New World has been vaguely tainted by the slew of woozy filmic xeroxes that have followed, but his first comeback – in which Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain stand in for his parents in 1950s Texas – is a choking knockout. CS Read the reviewJust nudging Gene Hackman’s Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson’s glorious 1930s confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core. Ralph Fiennes’s central turn as charming concierge M Gustave, all beneficent sex and abashed camp, remains the man’s finest hour. CS Read the reviewEdward Yang’s final film is a delicate domestic miracle: the story of one family seen through the perspectives of the father, the son and the daughter. A wedding begins proceedings, a funeral ends them. The stuff in the middle is the everyday, dissected with rare beauty and gravity.

AP Read the reviewHayao Miyazaki’s wondrous animation, the greatest success of a spectacular run from Japan’s Studio Ghibli. A gentle, mysterious fable about a 10-year-old girl whose family stumble upon a haunted bathhouse After her parents are turned into pigs, she works to lift the curse, encountering a variety of spirit-world beings along the way. AP Read the reviewMichael Haneke won his first Palme d’Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by – and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the reviewDespite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuarón returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the reviewSteven Spielberg’s portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who’d have thought? AP Read the reviewThe Coen brothers don’t really do personal, but this is as close as they’ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late 60s, A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt – triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the reviewThe Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome – “la grande bellezza” – in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino’s regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the reviewAn extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the mid-60s. Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them – with little need for encouragement – to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers’ glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the reviewJapanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or for this exquisitely turned drama that – like much of Kore-eda’s previous output – explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned how they hang together – or not – is the film’s key theme. AP Read the reviewOne of Isabelle Huppert’s finest performances, and that’s saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it’s all she can do to survive. AP Read the reviewFrom director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the reviewBrutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director László Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the reviewA magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch’s softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the reviewThe most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It’s totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors – especially actors – before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it’s scattergun satirically, it’s spot-on. Mostly, though, it’s just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the 2ft puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the reviewAn official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in 18th-century Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel’s fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it’s a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory – a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Giménez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man’s sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called “the Malick of Latin American cinema” but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the reviewThe triumph of Barry Jenkins’s coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway’s envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize – and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It’s simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the reviewAfter a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard’s own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue – this is all symbolic. AP Read the reviewHaving made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France’s deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous 1961 Paris massacre. Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the reviewHas there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai’s smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they’re a couple, technically. It’s 1962. Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair – with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It’s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality – a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the reviewJonathan Glazer’s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to “take home” – in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the reviewTwelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater’s story of a child’s life between six and 18 is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you – at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane – as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents – Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the reviewSteve McQueen’s real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 19th-century Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup’s 1853 memoir is to be astonished by the film’s fidelity. CS Read the reviewPaul Thomas Anderson’s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie’s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure.The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview’s deranged “milkshake” pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

In my last year of high school, with the adult world beckoning but largely unexplored, Sam Mendes and Alan Ball’s tart, neat diorama of suburban discord seemed excitingly grown-up, a lucid, witty articulation of all my most cynical teenage suppositions about my elders: that they were tortured and miserable and a bit pathetic, though with enough money and sex drive to make their ennui soapily intriguing.I certainly didn’t want to grow up into Lester Burnham, the film’s skeevily loosened white-collar hero: though the film was sympathetic to his midlife crisis, complete with a sports car, an indifferently lost job and an infatuation with his teenage daughter’s schoolmate, it wasn’t so tin-eared as to deem him cool. Nor could I admire any of the variously uptight adults in his orbit, from his prissy, materialistic realtor wife to his tersely closeted nextdoor neighbor.Still, I suppose I hoped to be a bit like American Beauty itself: quick and quippy and a bit poetic, nasty-smart and slickly good-looking. To that end, I watched the film several times that year, repeatedly read and practically memorised the screenplay that came as a free tie-in to an issue of Sight \u0026amp Sound, and used it as a primary reference in a precocious English essay about white male irrelevance that, come to think of it, may have been more 2019 than 1999. “Look closer,” the poster instructed. I’m not sure I did, though I certainly thought about a lot. It was, for better or worse, a formative film.I wasn’t alone, of course. Many people far older than me formed a similar attachment to the film’s glib, elegant, philosophically underscored comedy, not least the collective members of the Academy, who handed it five Oscars, including best picture, director and actor – the second for Kevin Spacey, and the one prize for the film that voters would probably soonest take back, given what we now know of his own lecherous middle-aged proclivities. It was a year, moreover, when the Academy was led by critics to their eventual choice. The film sailed on a current of breathless rave reviews from its debut at the Toronto film festival – a more unusual place to launch a major awards contender, back when major studio productions still dominated the race, though its success there set a new model for prestige autumn films with golden ambitions.It’s easy to forget that American Beauty was seen as such unusually fresh, fashionable Oscar victor by the end of the 90s. In a decade dominated by burnished period spectacle, it was the first contemporary-set best picture winner since The Silence of the Lambs eight years before its win was seen as a triumph for riskier, more sensuous American cinema. A year after Harvey Weinstein famously strategised a seven-Oscar sweep for the dainty comforts of Shakespeare in Love over DreamWorks’ robust frontrunner Saving Private Ryan, American Beauty marked the latter studio’s revenge: its relative edginess handily trounced its main opponent (and Weinstein’s favored contender), Lasse Hallström’s wet, weedy literary adaptation The Cider House Rules. It seemed, for a time, that the Academy had anointed a new American classic.Yet the pushback against American Beauty in the intervening two decades has been swift and merciless – taking root well before Spacey’s personal and professional downfall, though that certainly hasn’t helped. Ask film critics of various ages about it now and you will tend to meet with a uniform sneer, along with a blanket dismissal of its cheap-shot picket-fence satire, its broad characterisation, its purportedly misogynistic view of career women, or its awestruck command of metaphor as flimsy and floaty as, well, a plastic bag dancing in the breeze.You might hear grudging acknowledgement of its formal artistry, including the satin tactility of the late Conrad L Hall’s cinematography, or the eerie, echo-y, endlessly imitated percussion of Thomas Newman’s once-ubiquitous score. But that, too, is tempered with dismissiveness toward its makers. Theatre maestro Mendes never had quite the directorial career expected of him after American Beauty, as every one of his subsequent dramatic films (from Road to Perdition to the indie misfire Away We Go) registered as something of a handsome, impersonal disappointment, until he found his groove as part of the James Bond machine in Skyfall. Ball, meanwhile, somewhat undermined his breakout script by returning to its dysfunctional family themes to far richer, more exploratory, more tonally complex effect in Six Feet Under for cable TV – the place, some have argued, where American Beauty’s warped sitcom premise belonged to begin with.Not helping its case was that 1999 came to be canonised by critics as a modern landmark year in American cinema, yielding a bounty of innovative, influential milestone works both in the multiplex and indie spheres: from The Matrix to Magnolia, The Sixth Sense to Being John Malkovich, Eyes Wide Shut to Election, Fight Club to The Talented Mr Ripley. (The latter, of course, was the jewel in Weinstein’s crown that year of course he set it aside for The Cider House Rules when it came to awards campaigning.) Critical consensus now has Michael Mann’s controlled, sinewy, morally shaded media study The Insider (seven nominations, zero wins) as the film most wronged by American Beauty’s Oscar haul.And yet, with all this revisionist perspective in my head, I popped in American Beauty recently to find it oddly, sinuously bewitching still. Dated, yes, but that’s a double-edged sword: it turns out to be an exquisitely presented time capsule, a snapshot of middle-class, notionally liberal white society entering a spasm of panic at the turn of both the century and the Clinton era. Its satire isn’t sophisticated, but it’s pointed, identifiable, and still often cuttingly funny, emblematic of a tone of withering pre-millennial snark that has since been earnestly outmoded, and not for the wittier.It was never intended as straightforward drama, but as garish suburban burlesque: a distorted funhouse mirror reflection of America already at its ugliest, with its performances and petal-strewn visuals expertly heightened to match. By that token, it works a charm: view Spacey’s brilliantly icky-droll performance not as an exercise in misplaced heroism, but as a grim, complicit prophet of an even more dishonest, self-serving era of American patriarchy to come. Spacey’s uncovered private life makes the joke a bit sicker, admittedly, but damn if he isn’t pitch perfect in this.There are, of course, false notes aplenty, ones more critics ought to have spotted even then: Annette Bening’s unhinged virtuosity only goes so far towards concealing what an ungenerous, ill-thought con the character of Carolyn Burnham is, not so much an empty woman as an empty construct. The teenage characters are all emo and no real emotion, vessels for the film’s sweetest but thinnest stabs at profundity. (American Beauty is a film that feels most authentic when it’s least sincere.) And that script I loved so much, for all its smart, savoury dialogue, is built on diagrammatic ironies – the homophobic military man’s a closet case, the self-styled slutty girl’s a virgin – that all ring a bit screenwriting 101, whatever truths are embedded within.And yet, and yet. I remain deeply, melancholically affected by American Beauty – partly, of course, because it reflects gently back to me the unformed, uncertain child I was when I first saw it. But it also moves me on its own terms and merits, its own sly critique of a fragile milieu, its own pristinely art-directed yin-yang of sadness and sarcasm, its own vulnerable but defensively lacquered performances. Hell, I still think all the rose petal business is woozily beautiful. Twenty years on, American Beauty isn’t as clever as we thought it was, though it’s inadvertently aged into a kind of wounded, embattled wisdom. Perhaps it’s worth looking closer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f19e553f25d9ae52666c6a4731a936caabc722f/158_476_3182_1910/master/3182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c12975a0eb5f45ef57d07112848ce6f","title":"arsenals alexandre lacazette ruled out until october with ankle injury","story":"• Arsenal depleted in attack for busy spell of matches• Gabriel Martinelli and Tyreece John-Jules could get chancesAlexandre Lacazette will be out until October as he recovers from an injury to his left ankle, leaving Arsenal short of attacking options during a spell that brings seven matches in three weeks.Arsenal confirmed that Lacazette had been playing through an “ongoing ankle issue” for weeks and would return next month.

Sure, they have scored only once there across their two league matches this season and, yes, both of their opponents ended depleted by a second-half dismissal. But, when a team have won only 39 of 116 home games as they embark on a seventh successive season in the top flight, even the merest hint of a positive is to be grasped.Yet, for all that there is promise in the relative recent upturn on home territory, it is Palace’s forte on their travels which will leave Tottenham Hotspur wary on Saturday. Some more raw statistics: only Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Manchester United and Chelsea boast more than the 50 points accrued by Roy Hodgson’s Palace on their travels in the two years since his appointment. Sam Allardyce’s Palace were the last away side to win at Anfield but it is the current manager who has masterminded the most recent victories by league visitors to the Etihad, the Emirates and Old Trafford.This team were built to flourish on the counter, blessed with pace up front and industrious players who occupy deeper positions. Those managers who have excelled with Palace since promotion in 2013 have tended to boast a certain pragmatism. This team have ended a season having mustered a half-century of league goals only twice over the past six campaigns and, aside from Christian Benteke’s first year at the club, have lacked a prolific front-man. “But I’d include the forwards in that band of players who work very hard to protect the goalkeeper,” said Hodgson when charting diligence. “Right from the front we have worked to defend, seal off spaces and make it hard for teams to get behind us.“It has been a real team effort. When the opposition have the ball we work prodigiously to get and keep in shape, and keep them in front of us because, if the game becomes very open, we might not always come out on top. We have players who, given time and space, can use it to their advantage, and we have to make sure we don’t relent on that side of our game.”A lack of guile has been an issue in unlocking what Hodgson cited as “circumspect” opponents in south London. Away from Selhurst Park, when hosts sense Palace are a side they should beat, they are capable of rare ruthlessness.Yet if the defence are currently the stingiest in the ision – with Gary Cahill excelling since his summer arrival, and Mamadou Sakho and James Tomkins restored to fitness – they will need Wilfried Zaha to spark across the capital if they are to secure another notable scalp. The Ivorian, attempting to split from his long-term agent at Unique Sports Management, has been striving for rhythm after an unsettling summer. Palace know he would rather be elsewhere but, unless a suitor matches an asking price unlikely to dip below £80m in January or the summer, the 26-year-old’s future remains at the club through whose academy he graduated.Zaha, legitimately enough for a player of his talent, pines for an opportunity to play in the Champions League. Palace spent the international window in the rarefied air of fourth place, though, with the season still in its infancy, aspirations remain realistic. Their October looks daunting. As for this weekend, it is 22 years since they won a league game at Spurs.Hodgson had reminded the throng at a Palace for Life Foundation event in midweek it is “not going to be rainbows and blue skies all the way through”. Yet the manager will go into his planning meeting with the chairman, Steve Parish, next week with the hierarchy acutely aware of how reassuring his presence remains. The 72-year-old has entered the final 12 months of his contract. “But it’s not a meeting about my contract,” Hodgson said. “It’s a meeting about the future of the club. If my role in that future comes up, we’ll discuss it.” He has no great desire to bid farewell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db94e37ab4f48265e8063dcf8622fe2a37deac2/8_0_2544_1526/master/2544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f0df1aea8f49f9a5c04143816e95dd0","title":"cristiano ronaldo superstar era international record","story":"Famously, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il only ever played one game of golf. In 1994 state media reported Kim had picked up a club for the first time at the country’s only golf course. Happily he took to the sport instantly, completing his debut round in a world-record 38 under par with 11 holes in one. At which point he announced he was retiring from golf and would never play again.It is of course a terrible blow for golf to lose such a talent, and tantalising to imagine just how good the Supreme Commander Of The People’s Army could have become. Worse, there is no recording of the round, just the sworn testimony of his 17 bodyguards that it definitely, like, happened. Plus of course Kim had a wide brief of other interests to cram in, among these composing six full opera scores, all of which are, according to state records, “better than any other in history”.Perhaps it’s just me, but as time has passed there has been something of the dictator-propaganda machine about the endless slew of Ronaldo-Messi facts and stats and milestones. You know the kind of thing. Six hundred goals. Fifty hat-tricks. Threw an apple over a petrol station. Only man to score simultaneously on a single day against every single team in the league.Gorging on this, cramming in great dripping handfuls of left-footed assists in a calendar year, or the fact that more people follow Cristiano Ronaldo on Instagram than have ever died in the whole of human history, you can grow a little dizzy. Why not a thousand goals? Why not a million goals? Worse, the thought occurs that these Ronaldo-Messi numbers are not robust, that they’re products of a moment in football history when money, talent-hoarding and changes in the rules have made it possible to dominate completely, ushering in this stream of super-numbers, all of them better than all the other numbers from times when such numbers were impossible.Except, of course, this isn’t quite right. Every now and then a stat crops up that really does take the breath away, a reminder that there is a cold hard edge of genius at work here. This week brought one of those. On Tuesday night Ronaldo scored four goals for Portugal in Vilnius to break Robbie Keane’s Euro qualifier goals record. More exciting still, Ronaldo is now on 93 international goals, 16 behind Ali Daei’s all-time international mark for Iran.Watching him against Lithuania he still looks like the same old Ronaldo, the same old snake-hipped robot-replicant physique, the sense of a man-sized wedding cake figurine miraculously come to life. The actual goals were pretty ragged: a penalty a triple-layered fluke (slip, bobble, deflection) a tap-in from a lovely pass by Bernardo Silva and a classy late sidefoot.Clearly Portugal will waltz through qualifying. Next up are Luxembourg twice, Ukraine and Lithuania at home. At this rate Ronaldo could end up passing the 100 goal mark before the end of the year, and then hauling in the all-time record at next year’s Euros. It is a startling prospect, if only because it is such a funny record for Ronaldo to break, a brilliantly literal-minded notion of greatness. “I’m going to score more goals than anyone else ever! This will mean that I’m the best!” And oddly enough, perhaps it might, if only because this is such an unusual, out-there feat in modern football.Just look at the top 10: Ali Daei, Kunishige Kamamoto, Godfrey Chitalu, Hussein Saeed, Bashar Abdullah, Sunil Chhetri. Add in Pelé, Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis. And now you know who. This not the kind of list anyone ever really talks about topping. No serious modern elite-level footballer actually scores 100 international goals. Daei’s record is an outlier, a much-loved folksy detail,: like Mull of Kintyre being No 1 for six months or the world’s tallest man always being mild-mannered Robert Wadlow in his waistcoat and sad specs. You don’t “chase down” or crowingly overhaul dear old Ali Daei.Except, of course, it turns out you do. At least if you have the capacity to reduce and refine your powers to the status of a kind of mobile goal-hammer, and in the process carry your team with you. Ronaldo scored his first Portugal goal for a nation that had never reached a major final. Fifteen years later, the Ronaldo , they’ve been in three and won two of them. Fifty-five of those 93 goals have come in tournament qualification. Nineteen have come in finals. As astonishing 56 have come in his past 60 caps.Yes: stat-blah, numberwang, glazed eyes. But no one else is doing this. And if he does get to 110 we may just have to accept that yes, goals are an incredibly simple metric but then yes, they’re also the metric that matters most. Part of Ronaldo’s strange brilliance has been to turn himself into a high-end product, human Coca-Cola, a substance that never changes, never ages, never exists as anything but pure, uncut, unvarying Ronaldo. More goals, more insistent, relentless influence. What more is he supposed to do?It won’t become clear how violently Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have distorted modern football until they are finally gone until it becomes clear this wasn’t just an evolutionary shift where genius-level attacking players would from now on dominate the sky. In fact they are simply stand-alone superstars, a brilliant fluke of all-time talent in the same time and space.Football has slightly choked on this in recent years. The absurdity of Neymar, the pointless urge to style a brilliant team player such as Raheem Sterling as the next GOAT-style inidualist: these are the aftershocks of the star culture we have naturally ingested as a side product. That era is entering its dog days. The passing of Daei’s goal record would be another significant endnote, perhaps even a suitable full-stop.

Grander than you might think, Lancaster, if you think about it at all. Only intrepid tour coaches make it this far, leaving this slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildings largely for the Lancastrians. Its severe castle, high on the hill, looks ripped enough to withstand a meteorite, while the streets and squares below, curling round the foot of Castle Hill and spreading up to Dalton Square and the Town Hall, are thick with columned porticoes, churches and stone Georgian townhouses. This grandeur came at a cost, of course, one mostly paid by slaves. Lancaster was once the fourth largest slave trade port in England after London, Liverpool and Bristol, a fact it finally acknowledged in 2005 with a memorial to the millions amid the warehouses and wharves on St George’s Quay. Far more searing, though, is a tiny 18th-century grave to a slave who died soon after arriving, lonely amid salt marshes by the seashore just outside the city, at Sunderland Point. Residents and schoolchildren tend it still, with flowers and painted stones.The case against… More could be made of the city’s riverfront and recent developments and buildings don’t live up to the city’s heritage.Well connected?

Read our countdown of passionate pop, electrifying rock and anthemic rap – and see if you agreeby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas (1-50)  Laura Snapes and April Curtin (51-100)Seven years after her previous album, Apple’s return sidelined her orchestral trademarks for an austere, homespun sound that exposed her insular lyrics even more starkly. Listen to the album.The first album album from an artist whose records had previously propped up killer singles with passable fillers turned her disaffection and disappointment into generational anthems. Listen to the album.The Malian guitarist set a new career benchmark with this intimate set, adding classical western harp and African ngoni to her subtle, bluesy electric guitar. Listen to the album.Trip-hop duo Moloko was dead, and Murphy teamed up with Matthew Herbert for this eclectic, saucy – and still underrated – pop record that anticipated the arrival of Lady Gaga by three years. Listen to the album.Drawing from house, psychedelia and even Bollywood soundtracks, Missy’s third – the one responsible for Get Ur Freak On – forced pop to catch up with her yet again. Listen to the album.XCX stopped waiting around for mainstream acceptance and showed the normies what they were missing with this bracingly eclectic, guest-laden mixtape. Listen to the album.Merrill Nisker grafted sweaty, human filth on to the clean machine shock of electroclash on her hilarious, titillating debut as Peaches. Listen to the album.Filled with crushing, funereal dirges and a song about wanting to encase a newborn baby in metal to prevent its growth, the Duluth group’s fifth album was nonetheless inexplicably beautiful. Listen to the album.Part state-of-the-nation opus, part eye-opening trawl through the unexplored depths of Badu’s brain. Listen to the album.Two Malian greats met for this soothing, spontaneous record of guitar and kora that is as subtly textured as it is generous. Listen to the album.No disposable vocalist or featured artist, the charismatic, club-savvy south Londoner gave dubstep its first real star. Listen to the album.Swift’s first “officially documented pop album” saw her shake off any remaining country trappings to become a gleaming synthpop behemoth. Listen to the album.The Seattle group’s debut heralded a generation’s post-recession retreat into rural comforts, conjuring a pastoral idyll from the best of west coast folk and British traditionalism. Listen to the album.The finest boyband breakout since Robbie Williams’s Life Thru a Lens, and that’s not damning with faint praise: Timberlake’s NeptunesTimbaland-helmed debut was slick, sexy and most importantly, convincing. Listen to the album.Smith’s final album followed his brief adoption by Hollywood, and added a cinematic grandeur to his work – but, thankfully, it didn’t swamp his haunted songwriting. Listen to the album.The album that ushered in the moody, neon-lit synthpop that would define the rest of the decade, Ruth Radelet playing Nico to Johnny Jewel’s Velvet Underground-worthy cool. Listen to the album.Twenty-five years after forming, the Congolese group made their name with this rhythmic explosion of likembes (thumb pianos) put through junkyard amplification. Listen to the album.Written before the death of one of Cave’s teenage sons – not after it, as was often assumed – Skeleton Tree nonetheless cast Cave’s recurring themes in unsettlingly anaesthetised new light. Listen to the album.The album that every hushed, autumnal indie record aspires to be, a cocoon of disaffection. Listen to the album.Madlib and MF Doom combined for an album that rattled with enough innovation and enough bars to prop up 10 records. Listen to the album.The provocative pop debut that made pastiche into an art form and revelled in the artifice and ambition of fame. Listen to the album.West justified his arrogance by setting it alongside sharp political commentary (at a time when few of his peers were speaking up) and fiercely arresting production. Listen to the album.Despite an outstanding lineup of guests and producers, all eyes were on Drake’s journey into and out of heartbreak, variously bitter, angry and doe-eyed. Listen to the album.Kevin Martin’s discordant and seductive second, voicing his discontent via an array of guest MCs. Listen to the album.Wild Beasts were a sad casualty of the last decade, but Two Dancers found the Cumbrian lads at their prime, bringing Chaucerian ribaldry to football terrace hooks. Listen to the album.A multicultural celebration, a political statement and a middle finger up to misogynists. Listen to the album.The Malian artist made his best album at the age of 53, his playing and duets with female singers conveying a sense of spontaneity that belied his deep craft. Listen to the album.A biting subversion of the era’s cocaine rap, evident in the despairing lyrics and magnetically ruined textures. Listen to the album.The voice of a generation: pissed, pissed off and funny, Allen’s debut brought a welcome reality check to a sheeny era of pop. Listen to the album.Midlake backed the former Czars frontman on this remarkable return to form following a period of heartbreak, addiction and depression. Listen to the album.Thought shaky at the time, her controversial debut – the one responsible for Video Games – has since acquired cult status. Listen to the album.Single A-Punk masked a hugely erse album: a strange yet winning mix of flutes, strings and Afrobeat. Listen to the album.The moment they made the transition from white-collar worriers to rarefied indie giants: the elegiac Boxer is as much of a New York totem as Is This It or Interpol’s debut. Listen to the album.Eminem’s third album has dated horribly with its homophobia and gleeful suggestion of violence against women, but in other parts of the album the incisiveness with which he unspools his misanthropic take on life remains transgressively vital. Listen to the album.Pristine neo-soul played by an old soul in a 19-year-old’s body. On her debut, Keys was a traditionalist steeped in pedigree, but not so schooled that it stifled her vulnerability. Listen to the album.Loaded, but only in the sense that XTRMNTR suggested heavy artillery locked and ready to fire: few good times here. Listen to the album.Lascivious, soulful and compellingly weird, Kelis was ahead of her time – though it’s still thrilling to remember that the extremely unsubtle Milkshake was a No 2 hit. Listen to the album.Gothic and abrasive in equal parts, the Swedish brother-sister duo’s third album offered ceaseless electronic invention at a time when their synth-minded peers were content to till their way through music history’s trash. Listen to the album.Infectious ego, unknockable confidence and hysterical commentary: a relic from lighter days that did not foresee West’s extraordinary evolution. Listen to the album.Matching Jonathan Richman for wry, detail-heavy storytelling and Sufjan Stevens for orchestral whimsy, Lekman elevated romantic mishaps in his Gothenburg home town to cinematic proportions. Listen to the album.A bracing introduction to an uncontainable ambition: Monáe’s intergalactic debut proper straddled James Brown funk, pastoral whimsy and indie quirk, and later albums proved this was barely a fraction of her talents. Listen to the album.This masterpiece in turning samples and meticulous tinkering into an era-defining production statement was released the week of the rapper’s death. Listen to the album.Winehouse at her most innocent – if you could ever call her that, given the cheekiness of songs like Fuck Me Pumps. Listen to the album.Mixing chilling realism with devastating metaphor, Vordul Mega and Vast Aire painted a grim, dystopian vision of their native New York City. Listen to the album.Sex, sedition and Marilyn Monroe reveries fuelled Annie Clark’s third album, which slipped serrated blades through the barbiturate wooze. Listen to the album.The Springsteen comparisons were fair: not since the Boss had music sounded so good driving along an empty highway. Listen to the album.Whether shaking your ass to Digital Witness or drifting off with Prince Johnny, you did so under a constant cloudburst of ideas. Listen to the album.Pharrell at his horniest ever – Truth or Dare hints at an orgy before Tape You records the sounds of one – but Bobby James is one of his loveliest ballads. Listen to the album.Overlapping acoustic guitars blend like plumes of smoke, and inspired snatches of melody flit by – but bursts of noise and distortion herald danger deep in the woods. Listen to the album.Theirs was the New York of Taxi Driver or Midnight Cowboy: fraught with rain and danger, energy crackling like the wires of a vandalised phone box. Like their peers the Strokes, the quartet made rhythm guitar the lead and foregrounded the bass, but cast them in sombre black suits rather than artfully distressed denim. Their ballad NYC became an unofficial civic anthem, synthesising the mix of sorrow and tenacity that defined the city in the wake of 911. Listen to the album.After D’Angelo’s years in the wilderness, struggling with addiction and indirection, many thought he was finished. He not only came back, but did so with one of the most incendiary soul records in decades. The funk deepened – the way Prayer smears its on-beat is astonishing – along with his social conscience on The Charade, though the bedroom door still beckoned constantly. Listen to the album.It’s now impossible to imagine a world without Seven Nation Army, chanted from football terraces to political rallies. The band’s biggest hit set the template for Elephant: brooding moods, measured out in eighths by Meg White, would tip over into cathartic squalls of blues rock. Jack White’s much-lampooned fetish for analogue production is legitimate – you can almost feel the breeze from the amps on your face as the riffs strut out – and he squeezed more tone out of the electric guitar than almost anyone else that decade. Listen to the album.The trio had always sounded – appealingly – like a band rehearsing in a garage, but here they threatened to blow its door open and its walls apart. Like a superhero who doesn’t realise their own strength, everything hits too hard, burning the edges of the guitars and drums with fuzz. Their most ferocious album, then, though the wry and bitter ballad Modern Girl uses the distortion to prettier ends. Listen to the album.A massive leap in ambition as the synthpop of Visions was pulled into HD, driven up a gear and transformed into pop-punk as thrillingly fast and trashy as a Nascar race. Tracks such as Kill V Maim were made for the balls of your feet, full of the chillingly cutesy pep of east Asian pop, but the best tracks were the robo-funky World Princess Part II and the demo version of Realiti: the sound of speeding through a city, its sounds muffled inside a luxury sedan. Listen to the album.Released more than 10 years since their pair of trip-hop-defining albums, Third proved the west country trio still had it – it being their particular mood of bruised, bloodied tenacity in a world that wasn’t just uncaring, but actively violent. While they tease out the Morricone influence all the more, the highs are all their own – krautrock nightmare We Carry On cyberpunk masterwork Machine Gun – on a record that has become one of the most influential of its era. Listen to the album.A relatively bummer record as the polo-shirted princes of prep entered an early midlife crisis: “Wisdom’s a gift but you’d trade it for youth,” Ezra Koenig sings at one point. But that wisdom, an upgrade from the mere cleverness of their earlier work, led to their most rounded songwriting yet, still gassed up with the fizz of old. Listen to the album.More accessible but no less skilful or hard-hitting than its predecessors, Damn rightly became the first non jazz or classical album to win the Pulitzer prize for music. Kendrick’s brilliance is to swoop between scales – nations, communities and iniduals – to create a truly rounded portrait of contemporary love and politics, and the sheer lip-smacking perfection of his flow on Humble made it his biggest track yet. Listen to the album.A band working in perfect equilibrium, where wild prog and bug-eyed Burroughs-esque visions were tethered by earthy punk. The cracked poetry (“Jigsaw pattern dominoes left a trail  The whites of their eyes  Polaroids of the tale”) was chewed up and then spat out for moshpit soundbites (“Cut away!”, “Is it heavier than air?”), between see-sawing riffs and bursts of pure noise. Listen to the album.That Frank Ocean appears three times in this list is testament to his universal appeal – this mixtape debut opened with a Coldplay cover, and Radiohead, the Eagles and even a sample of Nicole Kidman crop up, too. Released by the Odd Future collective, he and they have done so much in the last decade to break rap and R\u0026ampB out of tired, restrictive genre considerations. Listen to the album.With its profile raised by a Mercury prize win, this album was the first time many people had encountered Anohni’s voice, which didn’t so much apply vibrato as become it: a beautifully wobbling, wavering thing that instantly entranced. Rooted in the cabaret songcraft of queer New York, she would go on to embrace electronic pop. Listen to the album.Made amid her most troubled phase, Blackout defied the odds to become a diamond pressed from trash. The production is all sleazy, buzzing electro, and Britney’s melodies have the twisted naivety of nursery rhymes. The two big singles are genius: Piece of Me bats back tabloid gossip with a sonic golf club, and Gimme More is her best-ever song, an erotic psychodrama where the purring come-ons of the title also sound like a woman drowning under her ambition. Listen to the album.For all the hype, the Brooklyn scene of the early 00s didn’t produce many genuine rock stars, but Karen O was its finest. On the group’s debut, she could electrify her withering bluesy scorn with a single yelp, and suddenly she’d be a banshee screaming round the rafters meanwhile the song Maps was pure vulnerability. Yeah Yeah Yeahs is not just O’s show: like Jack White, the other great guitarist of those years, Nick Zinner could make his axe into bass and lead at all once, and drummer Brian Chase pits tub-thumping toms against seething hi-hats. Listen to the album.After bulging baroque creations The Age of Adz and The BQE, Stevens pared everything back to soft electronics and fingerpicking for this moving rumination on his stepfather and late mother. He stumbles, numb, through his own poetry, pondering suicide, gaining existential clarity and – crucially – finding beauty: “The breakers in the bar  The neighbour’s greeting.” Listen to the album.Tiny, lisping and with a high-pitched voice, Grimes weathered plenty of sexism with her breakthrough – but converted even indie snobs with her take on rave, Italo and industrial synthpop. The electro bass lines are the album’s signature, lurching from the deep, but it is her vocals that make it: a shapeshifting chorus of chattering gothic cheerleaders, solemn choristers and trance as. Listen to the album.After keeping their heads down for their brilliant 1997 debut, letting Spike Jonze videos do the talking, Daft Punk revealed themselves – sort of. The duo were obscured behind robot heads, and their music got equally playful: cock-rock guitars, vocoders and brilliantly manipulated slivers of records by ELO, Tavares and Eddie Johns condensed into tinny yet heavy filter-house. Listen to the album.It has the air of a piece of obsessional outsider art: 3,500 samples stitched together into a dense tapestry of goofy hip-hop and lounge pop. Miraculously, it makes a virtue of its maximalism: the title track thick with jasmine and tropical heat, Electricity jumping out of the speakers like a jack in the box. Listen to the album.The backstory is almost a parody of a certain kind of earnest dude: retreating to the woods with just a guitar to get over a breakup and sort out his crappy life. But after listening to the songs he came back down the hill with, the story becomes gilded and mythic: lightly fleshed out with vocal harmonies and drums, they are sensationally beautiful. Listen to the album.MIA frequently showed just how conservative the US is by doing ordinary things – rapping while pregnant, sticking her middle finger up – that nevertheless had people reaching for the smelling salts. It all began with her debut collection of blown-out rap and dancehall, stitched together with samples from a trolley dash down the unregulated internet – a harbinger of our cosmopolitan post-genre age. Listen to the album.The ghosts of London raves gone by are conjured by this ouija board of a record, where garage vocals flit upward past dust-covered breakbeats. The influence of this and his 2006 debut cannot be overstated, feeding into the dub songcraft of the xx and James Blake, as well as an entire generation of ambient producers. It also anticipated the way London’s clubland – and indeed communities – would be hollowed out by gentrification. Listen to the album.By blending the frat-boy energy of nu-metal with the goth moods of Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins, the northern Californians united rival factions of brooding teenagers with these strangely sexy studies in tension and release. Chino Moreno’s voice is magnificently plastic – rapping, bellowing, crooning, and deploying his secret weapon: vocal fry that creaks like a door to a haunted house. Listen to the album.This album is lauded for the three masterpieces Aaliyah made with Timbaland – Try Again, More Than a Woman and We Need a Resolution – that lend a serpentine malevolence to her voice, but there are also strong old-school jams and languorous ballads. Lesser R\u0026ampB stars match their voice to the beat – Aaliyah’s genius, tragically cut short when she was killed in a plane crash, was to slink through it with an almost Latin sense of rhythm. Album not on streaming services.The gentle glitches and serene pulses on this intimate, sensual, clean record could sound naive, even simplistic, when put next to the complexity of her recent work with the producer Arca, but Vespertine remains one of Björk’s defining records thanks to the strength of its songwriting. Unison rivals Massive Attack’s Unfinished Sympathy as the great ballad of trip-hop It’s Not Up to You is almost Disney-esque in its sweeping beauty. Listen to the album.Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim made the most compelling duets of the period: rather than singing to each other, it was as if two people were going through the same thing without the other knowing it – the perfect mood music for the disconnected interconnection of dating apps and social media. Listen to the album.We’d seen Beyoncé angry before, whether defiant on Survivor or chillingly, wittily calm on Irreplaceable, but never like this. Made after notable incidents of police brutality, Lemonade was charged with real political fervour, while there were numerous sharp jabs at Jay-Z for doing whatever predicated that elevator fight with her sister Solange. As a result, the final call for her ladies to get in formation felt genuinely martial. Listen to the album.Released two days before he died, Blackstar saw Bowie pour everything left of him into his best album since his 70s hot streak. He spliced the itchy drum’n’bass and industrial moods that fascinated him in the 90s with terrifically freaky jazz, symphonic balladry and – on Girl Loves Me – authentically heavy rap. “I’m dying to push their backs against the grain  and fool them all again,” he sang. And he did. Listen to the album.Although less than the sum of their parts as they were on Stankonia, and with neither editing out the other’s longueurs, the ided members of OutKast nevertheless delivered a vivacious pair of solo turns. Big Boi embraced saucy brass licks and propulsive flow while André 3000 tapdanced through funk, though each arrived at solid gold pop: The Way You Move and Hey Ya! are both deserved wedding disco staples. Listen to the album.Harvey won her first Mercury prize for Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea on 911. She won her second for her other masterpiece, released 10 years later, in the shadow of the wars that dragged on between them. There is such anger as she reaches back to the first world war to show how every generation destroys its young in the same way – summed up by the pompous fanfare in The Glorious Land, crushed by a tank of blues-rock. Listen to the album.The deaths of relatives of band members Regine Chassaigne, Richard Reed Parry, and Win and Will Butler underpinned the (mostly) Canadian band’s debut. The songs here are full of the horrible electricity of grief, Win Butler sometimes hollering at the pain, sometimes burned out by it. But the massed choruses suggest relief can be found in family, be it blood or otherwise, marking the arrival of one of the period’s few great arena bands. Listen to the album.More city than sea, PJ Harvey’s most accessible and open-hearted record conjures that feeling of being on a rooftop, wanting to hear every story in the streets below you. It is full of energy, Harvey stalking the gutters and subways it is full of sex, most of it new and dangerously in flux. But then there are moments on songs such as Beautiful Feeling or Horses in My Dreams, where the mass of bricks and steel dissipates and you’re adrift on the ocean. Listen to the album.Kanye ed into a hell of racism, commerce, relationship strife and his own ego, with beats made alongside a brains trust of experimental producers. It seethes with trauma both personal and social, and the strongest moments consider how black America is sticking its head in the sand – even Kanye himself, fretting about Kim while a sample of lynching lament Strange Fruit plays. But there are flickers of his old cheeky humour, especially in the immortal line: “Hurry up with my damn croissants!” Listen to the album.The first rap masterpiece of the century was an epic that covered all of hip-hop’s bases – horndog G-funk on We Luv Deez Hoez and I’ll Call B4 I Cum, raunchy boom-bap on Xplosion, rap-rock on Gasoline Dreams, pop on Ms Jackson – but added endless new flavours: drum’n’bass, acid, psychedelic soul. Listen to the album.From the spine-tingling four-note downward melody that opens Everything in Its Right Place, it was clear that Radiohead had taken a huge leap into colder, stranger territory. The electronic influences that had filtered into OK Computer reached maturity – most spectacularly on techno anthem Idioteque – though there are way more guitars than its reputation suggests. Listen to the album.By blending the earnestness of ballad singing with cascading waves of electropop, Robyn became the master of heartbreak on the dancefloor. There is another side here, too: chatty, puckish and getting over it all. The anchor of the album – initially released in a trailblazing three parts across 2010 – was Dancing on My Own, a breakup song with a wildly transgressive edge: is there a secret erotic thrill behind the pain of going to the club to watch her partner with their new girlfriend? Listen to the album.The breakthrough moment for rap’s greatest ever talent. Loosely based around an LA street narrative, the storytelling was gripping the bangers banged hard and it has Lamar’s most gorgeous melodies, on Money Trees, Swimming Pools (Drank) and Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe. The blithe stoicism of his flow, seemingly resigned to a violent death at any moment, fills the record with poignancy, and transmutes his words into wisdom. Listen to the album.The sun-soaked indolence of being young in LA is etched in aquamarine, purple and, yes, orange on this psychedelic-pop landmark. The melody writing on Forrest Gump, Sweet Life, Thinkin Bout You, Lost and others is joyously accomplished and sturdy, leaving room for 10-minute electro suites, jazz-funk flexing, stoner rap and smoky neo-soul. A generation’s Stevie Wonder had arrived. Listen to the album.Initially grabbing headlines for its pay-what-you-want release online, it quickly became clear that this was one of Radiohead’s greatest albums. Undoing some of the knotted tension of the post-Bends era, it has rollicking rockers (Bodysnatchers, Jigsaw Falling into Place) and restless jitters (15 Step, Weird FishesArpeggi), but the core songs are deep, considered trip-hop ballads such as Reckoner, House of Cards and All I Need. Listen to the album.Less immediately catchy than its predecessor, Channel Orange, Blonde is the more ambitious and visionary record. Resistant to being boxed in any one genre, the percussion retreats, the voice warps, the focus wanders and the emotion deepens as Ocean slips and stumbles through a series of poetic romances. A magical, impossible-to-imitate record. Listen to the album.Love and self have always been Beyoncé’s two grand themes, but they were each invested with more passion and nuance than ever before on her fifth solo album. Appearing from nowhere with videos for every track, it announced her as the era’s defining megastar – marketing campaigns, it implied, were for the little people. But the album has endured past its grand entrance thanks to its detailed, impassioned considerations of femininity and marital sexuality. Listen to the album.He may now sing in an ironic mid-Atlantic croon, but Alex Turner started off with the most tangibly south Yorkshire voice in pop since Jarvis Cocker. Over street-fighting indie rock, he told of dirty dancefloors and scummy men, an observer sitting with his faced pressed up against a taxi window on a Saturday night watching humans bounce off one another. Listen to the album.You can almost touch the gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads in Mike Skinner’s debut, a love letter to living for the weekend written in UK garage that heralded the arrival of a brilliant British storyteller – Weak Become Heroes remains the single greatest evocation of being on ecstasy in a club. Listen to the album.If Wiley’s “eski beats” acknowledged grime’s froideur, then Dizzee Rascal turned the temperature down further: his debut is a chillblained study in urban harshness that remains grime’s masterpiece album. Amid videogame clatter, Rascal’s voice is full of scorn and bafflement as he considers girls, rivals and his place in the world. Listen to the album.James Murphy’s group were the smart, snippy toast of Brooklyn after the hyper-literate breakthrough tracks Losing My Edge and Yeah. On their second album, they broke through the snark, pondering their identities as New Yorkers, Americans and thirtysomethings – and with a range of potential dance moves, from pogoing to sleek disco shapes. Listen to the album.Folding in influences from LA’s beat scene – including Kamasi Washington and Flying Lotus – Lamar exploded the possibilities for rap in the 2010s, bouncing like a car down Crenshaw on to neo-soul, jazz and squelchy funk. The police-baiting Alright became a civil-rights anthem for the post-Ferguson era – indeed, as a celebration of the richness of black artistry, the whole album was a riposte to bigotry. Listen to the album.He would later lose the thread in a very public fashion, but Kanye West pulled every strand of his genius and torment together on his masterpiece: anthemic choruses, psychodrama lyrics and an all-star cast, from Bon Iver to that Nicki Minaj verse.

So it may come as disconcerting news that the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way appears to be growing hungrier.Astronomers monitoring the colossal object, called Sagittarius A*, found that in the past year it appears to have consumed nearby matter at an unprecedented rate.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea Ghez, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”In the latest study, the team analysed more than 13,000 observations of the black hole from 133 nights since 2003, gathered by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The black hole itself cannot be seen because it acts as a one-way trapdoor even for light. But it is possible to detect radiation blazing from gas and dust just outside the “event horizon” as they are accelerated towards their final fate.The team found that on 13 May the area just outside the black hole’s point of no return was twice as bright as the next brightest observation. They also observed large changes on two other nights this year, with all three of those changes being unprecedented, according to Ghez.The team also used a technique called speckle holography to reanalyse older, fainter observations dating back 24 years, from which they concluded that the level of brightness seen this year was unprecedented in the last quarter of a century.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase … and the rate of gas falling down the black hole drain has increased for an extended period, or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, a professor of physics and astronomy at UCLA and the paper’s co-senior author.One hypothesis is that the feeding frenzy is linked to the closest approach to the black hole of a star called S0-2 during the summer of 2018, and that a large quantity of gas from the star could have reached Sagittarius A* this year.Another possibility involves a bizarre object known as G2, which is most likely a pair of binary stars, which made its closest approach to the black hole in 2014. It is possible the black hole could have stripped off the outer layer of G2, Ghez said, which could help explain the increased brightness just outside the black hole. A third suggestion is that several large asteroids have been drawn into the cosmic sinkhole.The black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth and poses no danger to our planet. The findings appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a024e8c7d4c483034c9073be4447fae54496aa74/0_0_3500_1257/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e8199be9b68ed26f860645bba8d240a 960w","title":"women better than men at disguising autism symptoms","story":"GPs would miss fewer diagnoses if ‘camouflaging’ was better understood, say researchersWomen may not be diagnosed with autism as frequently as men because they are better at hiding the common signs of the condition, according to new research.Some autistic people use strategies to hide traits associated with the condition during social interactions, a phenomenon called social camouflaging. Scientists involved in the study say raising awareness of camouflaging among doctors could help reduce the number of missed autism diagnoses.Scientists studied the results of an online survey designed to measure gender differences in camouflaging in autistic and non-autistic adults. They found autistic women exhibited more camouflaging behaviours than men, which supported previous observations from self-reported studies. No gender camouflaging differences were reported in non-autistic groups.“The effect wasn’t as big as we were expecting,” said Dr Will Mandy, from University College London, one of the authors of the study, published in the journal Autism and presented at the British Science Festival at the University of Warwick.“What I’m finding interesting is how ubiquitous camouflaging is. When you start to dig into why, it’s quite alarming for starters it’s experienced as an obligation rather than a choice. It’s very often about self-preservation, avoiding bullying or attack.”Common camouflaging behaviours include learning how to make eye contact, or suppressing urges to move in physical ways which some autistic people would find comforting, called stimming, for example rocking of the body or flapping of hands.Data from non-binary people and other genders was also studied and no behavioural differences were found, although the sample sizes of these groups were small.“Anyone who is alert to autism won’t be surprised by these findings,” said Hannah Hayward, a researcher on autism in women at King’s College London. “We find that for a lot of females, their autistic traits are not being picked up or recognised in the same way that males have been at school. This is because we’re trying to fit their diagnosis through the same moulds as males, but often they don’t fit that criteria because their presentation is slightly different.Laura Hull, from University College London and also an author on the study, hopes the work will lead to positive change. “If we can get awareness of social camouflaging into the NHS or Nice guidelines, and get it known how common it is in both men and women, that would be so important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b2fa2b7a8aed897c42d3c17952acc7af34d691/0_216_4166_2499/master/4166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff870dfdf7365bec4582883c4101d14","title":"anthony joshua concussion andy ruiz jr boxing","story":"Anthony Joshua has admitted he knew he was concussed but was ready to “fight through” it against Andy Ruiz Jr, fuelling the debate over boxers’ safety that has been reignited this week.The British heavyweight told the  he felt he was concussed from the moment Ruiz Jr got off the canvas to knock him down in the third round in their bout in New York six months ago. After witnessing three further knockdowns, the referee, Michael Griffin, stopped the fight.Robert McCracken, Joshua’s trainer, said this week he was aware Joshua was “concussed” for the last four rounds of the fight against the heavy-handed Mexican before clarifying his use of the word following criticism from outside the boxing community.Joshua, the former three-belt world heavyweight champion who fights Ruiz in a rematch in December, said however that he was prepared to fight on. He was standing upright and seemingly sound in his own corner, his arms draped across the ropes.“I knew where I was,” Joshua told the  in an interview in New York shortly before McCracken’s comments. “But definitely they call it concussion … That’s what they call it. But I think concussion is a weak term. You’ve got to be stronger than it. You’ve got to fight through the concussion if you can.Returning to the end of the fight, when he was standing in his corner, Joshua added: “I just remember, my hands on the ropes. It’s a practice when I’m training and stuff.Following McCracken’s interview with the BBC’s boxing podcast, Luke Griggs, the deputy chief executive of the brain charity Headway, said: “Trainers have a duty of care to their boxers and it seems clear that Anthony Joshua’s trainer’s sole priority was winning that fight, not protecting the fighter from a potentially fatal injury.”The criticism prompted McCracken – a leading light-middleweight in the 1990s whose only losses came by stoppage in his last two contests – to release a statement and he was subsequently backed by the British Boxing Board of Control.“I am not a doctor and it may be that concussed is not the right term to have used,” McCracken said in the statement. “The health of all the boxers I work with is of paramount importance to me and I have always used my judgment and experience to do what is right for them.“There is no formal concussion protocol where the doctor steps in to assess the boxer, so you have to use your experience as a coach and your knowledge of the person to make a decision on whether you think they can recover.“I have had this a number of times in my career in professional boxing where boxers have recovered from a difficult round to go on and win the fight. I have also pulled boxers out of fights because I knew it was not in their interests to continue.”Griffin, a Canadian who has refereed 366 bouts since 1997, including many at world level, was right to stop the fight. He judged Joshua was not fit to continue.Joshua had taken intermittent punishment, in short bursts, without Ruiz landing a punch that definitively would keep him on the canvas. They were messy exchanges, but their effect was cumulative. That is what Griffin saw in Joshua’s eyes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f89dd60af1f9e9a5bc38e2f14f9e36aa9ae7ab/813_221_2897_1738/master/2897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ae261249ef1db906350baf05d16781","title":"england australia ashes final test day two match report","story":"• Final Test, day two: England 294 \u0026amp 9-0 Australia 225• Archer takes 6-62 Smith again top-scores for tourists with 80This was a day of few surprises but much activity. Jofra Archer took some wickets, six of them, to confirm his brilliant ascent as a Test cricketer. Steve Smith scored yet more runs his innings of 80 was vital for Australia but it also constituted his lowest score of the series. In the summer of 2019 Smith has been as impeccably prominent on our Test grounds (with the exception of Headingley) as Katya Adler has been on our TV screens.The destination of the Ashes has, of course, been decided and that may explain the nature of some of the cricket in this Test so far. Both sides are straining every sinew in the knowledge that the series can still be won or drawn and there are points to be gleaned for the Test Championship. They are all doing their utmost to win. But they cannot always hide their fatigue after this long – and wonderful – summer of cricket.That does not mean that a dull game is in store. Far from it. In fact the Test is racing along so fast that all those ticket-holders for the last day are in dismay at the moment England are ahead but a first-innings lead has guaranteed very little in this series. At the close they led by 78 runs with all their second innings wickets intact.And yet it is plain that the players of both sides are flagging. Of course there are exceptions. Smith retains his insatiable desire to bat, which is hardly a source of astonishment. Perhaps more striking were the performances of Archer and Sam Curran (three for 46), England’s most potent bowlers on an idyllic, autumnal day.England were bowled out for 294 in the morning and, well though Jos Buttler batted on Thursday, there was some exasperation that he played such a loose shot against Pat Cummins, Australia’s best bowler, when his beloved partner, Jack Leach, was looking so secure at the other end. Even so, his 70 was timely and a welcome reminder of what he can offer.Then the Australian openers came and went according to their usual timetable. In the second over David Warner was caught behind off Archer after an England review and there were the accustomed celebrations although Stuart Broad might be forgiven for thinking that he had just been deprived of another Test wicket. This was the eighth time in nine innings that Warner has failed to reach double figures in the series, a record that he may not wish to recall too frequently. Soon afterwards Marcus Harris’s wretched run continued when he was well caught at second slip by Ben Stokes off Archer.Then, as ever, Marnus Labuschagne and Smith restored the situation, adding 69 together without too much bother. Labuschagne scored more freely and more elegantly but, soon after being struck just below his right elbow, he was lbw to Archer for 48 when playing round a full, fast delivery.Now Curran, who had already prompted a few false shots from Smith, intervened. He dismissed Matthew Wade, lbw, and yet again Smith began to wonder who was going to keep him company out there. Mitchell Marsh did so for a dozen overs until he pulled a short ball from Archer to long-leg where Leach completed a well-judged catch.By now Curran had switched to the Vauxhall End and from there he looked more dangerous. He even induced Smith, on 66, to edge a cut shot the ball flew above the head of England’s number 66 at first slip but Joe Root could not quite grasp the ball. But Curran is not easily deterred and like Australia’s unlikely main wicket-taker in England’s innings, Marsh, he is fresh. Soon he found himself on a hat-trick.Tim Paine edged a straightforward catch to Bairstow. The next ball was perfectly pitched for a new batsman, full with a hint of inswing, and Pat Cummins was palpably lbw despite his decision to review. So Australia were labouring at 166 for seven and the England youngsters had been responsible for every wicket.Now something truly surprising happened. Smith was out. Chris Woakes, until this moment anonymous, was called up to replace Curran. His first ball was straight and Smith, to the consternation of everyone at the Oval including the bowler, missed it and was unreviewably lbw. For the record Smith has so far scored 751 runs in the series, despite missing one match, at an average of 125.16.England seemed so stunned by this turn of events that they offered a few easy pickings and there was a dropped catch by Leach on the boundary. But then Archer polished off the innings via a cunning, knuckle-ball yorker to Lyon and a breathtaking catch by Rory Burns in the gully, which accounted for Peter Siddle. Burns and Joe Denly, upon his return from welcoming his new daughter, just managed to survive until the close. Denly’s happy day was confirmed when he was dropped before scoring by Harris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcde387c6be9b8a9694840ce16f154fb8ac0f18/671_2_1923_1153/master/1923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ab2fae98a8d9c0dbd64e859ff043701","title":"fiji rugby world cup pacific islands fairer deal ben ryan","story":"Fiji, Samoa and Tonga export masses of rugby talent but need more resource sharing and better domestic managementThe average difference in scoreline of Tier 2 teams v Tier 1 teams, as well as the margin of their biggest defeats, has been coming down every World Cup since 2003. That trend may well come to a grinding halt in Japan.Steve Hansen, the All Blacks head coach, threw a few grenades at World Rugby after his side demolished Tonga 92-7 last weekend. He hit them twice – first about the lack of Tier 1 games for Pacific Island teams and then about the lack of financial support by World Rugby for those same nations.Rugby’s governing body was quick to respond to Hansen, saying a record £60m support package for Tier 2 teams had been provided for the World Cup and its preparation and that 120 of the 150 coaches and support staff involved in those teams have been identified and funded by World Rugby.Nothing was mentioned about Hansen’s first point because it didn’t have a defence. That punch landed and it is critical to finally getting a few more seats on that mahogany Tier 1 top table. Not only do the Tier 2 teams need more big games to get used to the intensity and learn from those encounters, but those top‑tier nations also need to agree to a share of the gate from those games to help significantly supplement what World Rugby provides.Do that and the beginnings of real change on the islands will be seen. Even a fraction of those profits will make a far bigger difference than World Rugby’s aid ever can. It has worked hard to finance these countries but it does not provide all the solutions. Those unions are still generally underfunded and money is not always spent in the right areas.Tonga Union is based in a two‑room shack with a whiteboard, fan and a laptop. Yes it has coaches and staff paid for by World Rugby. They will have had their preparation camps paid for too. However, the targeted funding by which World Rugby operates has led to the majority of funds in the Pacific being channelled to Fiji over the past four years – this has left Samoa and Tonga to survive on even less. This has affected their coaches’ visits to Europe and monitoring, with the knock-on effect of less communications with clubs and less access to players. Some World Rugby appointments to these unions are fantastic but some are because they could not get a job elsewhere. There is a reason for that and often local appointments are needed (on a fraction of those costs) – as much as an aspirational signpost for those local coaches and support staff.Don’t get me wrong, Tonga suffers from a serious lack of governance while internal politics in Samoa has led to a high turnover of coaches and players, both of which have caused big problems for those teams, but it is now about permanent positive change, not papering over the cracks. That means the competitions and the top unions actually helping and for World Rugby to take a harder line to make that happen and to enforce the right practices, procedure and governance in those Pacific unions.In Pool D in Japan Fiji have got a real chance of knocking over Australia or Wales and going through to the knockouts. They have an excellent coaching and management team that have largely been together since the 2015 campaign. They have world‑class players, will have a good culture, won’t worry about the schedules or have high demands and they will be incredibly resilient.World Rugby instigated a “scrum factory” in Fiji a few years ago to combat their front-row problems and it has worked well. Against them is preparation time compared to Australia and Wales. They have not had the intensity of matches compared to those two either. Finally, they have been formed from clubs all over the world in many leagues, not a small handful from one league in the way their major opponents have been. Cohesion is massive in team sport and, until Super Rugby gives a Pacific Island team a spot in their competition, then it is always going to be an issue.It is unfair to just point at World Rugby and say it is wholly the governing body’s fault that the islands are not maximising their potential. The major unions need to front up as do the major leagues and those island unions also need to improve.Super Rugby’s contractual demands mean there are more than 40 players in New Zealand and Australia franchises who could be available for Fiji, Samoa or Tonga making themselves unavailable because, if they are suddenly ineligible for NZ or Australia, their contracts could be in danger. That is just one example of countless changes required but they are all possible.Maybe as a result of going backwards in the World Cup on the field, it might all mean a move forwards in the future.“Vei Lomani”, or translated into English “love each otherwork together”, was the Fiji sevens motto at the Rio Olympics in 2016. For that same success in the XVs game, that is exactly what is needed across the game now.Ben Ryan coached Fiji’s sevens team to Olympic gold in 2016"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02ab6b0adde9100f6a0f25aec64b1a2ae7edcd6/285_360_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa45aef172b2d6e5a8648beb8dd5ae43","title":"talking horses crystal ocean was the best runner up a star could want","story":"Straarius has now won all five of the British Champions Series races in the long distance category this year and is odds-on to win the Long Distance Cup at Champions DayA hastily arranged trip to Town Moor added £56,710 to John Gosden’s prize money total for the season here -yesterday as his outstanding stayer Straarius, sent off favourite at 1-9 in the absence of serious opposition, took the Doncaster Cup for the first time.

He is not qualified for the sixth race in the series, Saturday’s St Leger, but his stable companion Logician will start an even-money chance for the final Classic of the season, despite concerns – for his trainer, at least – that an extended 14-furlongs takes him into unknown territory.“I think the big question always with the Leger is whether he will get the trip,” Gosden said. “He’s by -Frankel, who never went beyond a mile-and-a-quarter, out of a Daylami mare. Daylami was a good miler though he did go up to a mile-and-a-half.“From our point of view, it’s that last 185 yards that often catches them out, so I’d be confident up to the mile and six and after that, you’re in no man’s land.”Crystal Ocean, whose career has been ended by a leg injury, will not be remembered as one of the greats but anyone who cares about horse racing should pray every night for more horses like him, excellent, top-class animals who are not quite the best around. If you’re not persuaded, let’s consider how much less interesting recent Flat racing in Britain would have been without him.We’d have lost a thrilling duel for this year’s King George and would instead have watched Enable come home two lengths ahead of Waldgeist, possibly the most “meh” result of all time. We’d also have lost a thrilling duel in last year’s King George, for which the 1-2-3 would become: Poet’s Word, Coronet, Salouen.Thanks to Crystal Ocean, last month’s Juddmonte International was also a hugely exciting battle to the wire. He lent a veteran’s grandeur to proceedings and helped prove that his conqueror, Japan, is as good as many of us hoped.He sent Cracksman off into retirement on a tremendous high simply by trailing six lengths after him in last year’s Champion Stakes. Every Red Rum looks better with a Crisp in the race and Crystal Ocean performed that vital function as well and as often as any horse I can think of. He played his part and, while he rarely got top billing, you always need a good Horatio, or else Hamlet spends far too much time talking to himself.

The ball swung more as the day went on, and I’ve been trying to swing it more consistently back into the right-handers – I’ve been working on my wrist position and a few things on the ball with my fingers. Trying to bowl more maidens is another way I’d like to improve.“It was really enjoyable bowling at the best batsman in the world. We’ve tried a lot of things but he’s been incredible. Hopefully he doesn’t get any in the second innings! I’ll be honest, the ball that got Matthew Wade was natural variation. If I don’t know, the batter’s not gonna know! I probably bowled a little too full for the hat-trick balls. But yeah, good fun.“I’d like to get a little bit quicker. Hopefully it comes naturally and with a bit of hard work. With the schedule it’s not easy to work on different things. At the moment I’m trying to be as consistent as I can – look at Jimmy, or Cummins and Hazlewood. I do get a bit excited now and again when I’m swinging the ball into the pads, but I’m slowly getting better.”That was another flawed and highly entertaining day’s cricket. Steve Smith made his lowest score of the series, 80, while Jofra Archer bowled masterfully to take his second six-for of the series. Sam Curran (3 for 46) and Marnus Labuschagne (48) also had good days.England will return tomorrow as clear favourites to win the match, although they’ll want plenty of insurance against a matchwinning epic from Smith. That’s the one thing he hasn’t achieved in the Ashes - his highest score in the fourth innings is 33, and he has never batted in a successful run-chase against England. Yet.Before he gets to bat, Australia’s champions, Cummins and Hazlewood, will go to the well one last time in an attempt to turn an Ashes retention into an Ashes victory. 4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 4, Denly 1) That was quite an eventful final over. Denly was dropped off the third delivery, an ostensibly simple chance to Harris in the gully. But he lost sight of the ball and it split the webbing on his hand. Funnily enough, Gary Naylor emailed 15 minutes ago to say it was becoming very difficult to sight the ball because of the low setting sun. Naylor knows.Burns is not out! It pitched miles outside leg, and that’s an unusually poor decision from Kumar Dharmasena. That’s stumps: England lead by 78.Burns is given out LBW to the last ball of the day - but he’s reviewed it! I think this pitched outside leg.3rd over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Burns does well to defend a full inswinger from Cummins, whose last ball of the day is another nasty bouncer. Burns ducks under it and then smiles, knowing he shouldn’t have to face any more deliveries today.2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Joe Denly, who drove back to the ground from Whitstable this afternoon following the birth of his second child, faces up to Hazlewood. The third ball zips past the edge, but the rest of the over is defended solidly. Two more overs for England to survive.1st over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Cummins ends a blistering first over by ripping one past Burns’ outside edge. Burns has surely earned the respect of the Aussie pace attack this series whatever the era, that must feel so good for an opening batsman.0.3 overs: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Pat Cummins, who looks justifiably radged off at having to bowl tonight, starts the innings with a ferocious assault on Rory Burns. His second ball hits the shoulder and flies for four leg-byes the next delivery hits the glove and deflects onto the grille, which means a break in play while Burns is assessed. He seems okay.Jofra Archer’s debut Test series: 4 Tests, 22 wickets at an average of 17.27. I’m pretty sure that no England bowler since the war has taken as many wickets against Australia in what was also their first Test series, although Frank Tyson had only played one Test before he obliterated Australia in 1954-55.England lead by 69, which is a decent bit of Steve Smith insurance for the fourth innings. They have around 20 minutes to bat tonight.Siddle steered Archer low to the right of gully, where Burns plunged to take a stunning one-handed catch. It was very similar to that legendary Stokes catch at Trent Bridge in 2015, although the ball wasn’t quite as far behind Burns. It was still a truly great catch – and it gives Jofra Archer the second six-for of his short Test career: 23.5-9-62-6. He is the gift that will keep on giving for the next decade. I have no idea what we’ve done to deserve him.What a catch from Rory Burns! This is right up there with Ben Stokes’ brab to dismiss Adam Voges four years ago.Five wickets for Jofra Archer! Lyon is cleaned up by a brilliant slower yorker that thuds into the base of off stump. That’s Archer’s second five-for in four Tests. He is a glorious cricketer.68th over: Australia 224-8 (Siddle 18, Lyon 25) Jack Leach comes into the attack, an interesting gamble given Lyon’s aggressive approach. His first over is pretty quiet - three singles, all swept. “Woakes should be given credit for the disguise he put on that ball to Smith,” says Ian Copestake. “He offered an innocuous-looking delivery that was in fact so innocuous it was nocuous.”67th over: Australia 221-8 (Siddle 17, Lyon 23) Lyon makes room to blast Archer over cover for four more - and then he’s dropped by Leach at fine leg! Oh dear, that was a pretty straightforward chance after Lyon top-edged a hook. In fact, Leach took a nice low catch but lost control of the ball when his arms hit the ground.66th over: Australia 215-8 (Siddle 16, Lyon 18) England lead by 89, which is plenty on a wearing pitch. But if Australia can reduce that to 40 or 50, a few England players might start to recall the unwelcome precedent of Melbourne 2013. Lyon adds four more, wafting Woakes breezily over mid-off, and then pings a short-arm pull for six! Haha, that was a sensational shot.“This is so, SO excellent, Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “I will fight anyone that says Test cricket is not the finest sport in all of humanity. And I have no idea who’ll win this Test match. Though it would be so England to be facing 340-9 at lunch tomorrow.”65th over: Australia 205-8 (Siddle 16, Lyon 8) Siddle, who is an excellent No9, waves Archer confidently through the covers for four more. This is Archer’s 22nd over of the day, although his pace is still good - the follow-up bouncer is clocked at 86.5mph.“So now we know Smith’s weak spot,” says Derek Walmsley. “Bowl over 1100 deliveries at him, and then watch his concentration go to pieces.” If only this was a 15-Test series. He’s shot to bits.64th over: Australia 201-8 (Siddle 12, Lyon 8) So, we could be heading for the first drawn Ashes since 1972. That’s such an unlikely statistic - no drawn series in almost 50 years. Yep, I can count.“Are these the worst batting stats, ever, for two teams in an Ashes series?” asks John Jones. “Woeful.”They aren’t even close. In the 19th century, 150 was usually a good score. In fact in the 1888 series, the average runs per wicket was 11.11. The average this year, 29.81, is the lowest in an Ashes series since 1998-99. 63rd over: Australia 198-8 (Siddle 9, Lyon 8) Jofra Archer returns, hunting the second five-for of his short Test career. Siddle thumps a full delivery through extra cover for three, and that’s your lot.62nd over: Australia 195-8 (Siddle 6, Lyon 8) Woakes, you could argue, is the only England bowler who has got Smith out in this series - once at Edgbaston and once today. The other dismissals were all when Smith was hitting out in pursuit of quick runs.The new batsman Lyon gets some quick runs of his own, twice thick-edging Woakes for four.“Rob, you said that Curran might not be in if Stokes was fully fit,” says Adam Roberts. “But what was the thinking for the 4th Test? As I asked during the OT Test, ‘What does Overton bring to this team that others such as Curran (or Woakes) don’t?’ OK, Overton did well as a batsman but Curran is a proven performer with bat and ball.”I assume they thought that pitch would offer more bounce, as Old Trafford often does. If so, they misread it, but I understand the logic. Breaking news: Steve Smith is out. Where’s Walter Cronkite when you need him? Smith walked across his stumps to the new bowler Woakes, missed the usual flick to leg and was plumb LBW. He didn’t even bother to review. It’s often said that you can’t bowl straight to Smith, but he does get out LBW a fair bit. He also flicks millions of deliveries for four, so there’s that.61st over: Australia 187-7 (Smith 80, Siddle 6) Leach continues with a maiden to Siddle.60th over: Australia 187-7 (Smith 80, Siddle 6) Curran moves around the wicket to Siddle, immediately slipping one past the outside edge, and them moves back over to beat Smith with a short ball. That’s drinks.Meantime, I love this stat. Steve Smith’s lowest score of the series is 80 not out. Only three players - Stokes, Burns and Wade - have a highest score in excess of 80. I’ve been wondering about this all series. If the regulations are adhered to, both sides should end the series with 0 points. Am I wrong?59th over: Australia 185-7 (Smith 79, Siddle 5) Jack Leach replaces Jofra Archer, who has figures of 20-9-48-4. Smith shows all three stumps and takes a delivery right off middle stump, like the bohemian genius he is. He has moved stealthily to within 21 of another hundred. 58th over: Australia 182-7 (Smith 76, Siddle 5) If England do rip it up and start again, Curran and Pope are the kind of young players they should invest in. Curran’s big-match temperament is so impressive, and he almost picks up a fourth wicket when Siddle survives a couple of LBW appeals after playing around the inswinger. Both were missing leg.“Sages were writing Curran off as being destined to be a batsman who bowls last season, but I saw that the hat-trick ball was up at 88mph and he seems to have increased his pace compared to last year,” says Tom Bowtell. “If he can get up regularly to 85 and keep the swing, he could be quite the player.”I suspect the length of his Test career will be determined by his ability to Chamindavaas wickets when the ball isn’t swinging. When it does swing, he’s a big threat, but when you pick an XI you can’t be sure whether the ball will swing.57th over: Australia 182-7 (Smith 76, Siddle 5) Smith is beaten by Archer, swishing outside off stump with fast hands. The next ball is short, forcing Smith to bend his back to get out of the way. This is a terrific contest - not quite as good at Lord’s, but still a fascinating struggle between a supernatural genius and a future all-time great.56th over: Australia 179-7 (Smith 75, Siddle 4) “Wonder if perhaps it was a huge mistake to not pick Curran for the first four Tests,” says Abdul Basit. “Could have added vital runs that might have saved the last Test, could have maybe taken much needed wickets. It was always a bizarre decision to drop him, and maybe Root missed a trick.”I don’t think they know his role, and he might not have played here had Ben Stokes been fit to bowl. I suspect they were burned by those Tests in the West Indies as well. He’s such an exciting player, though with the possible exception of Jack Crawford, no England allrounder has had as big an impact at such a young age.55th over: Australia 179-7 (Smith 75, Siddle 4) Smith cuts Archer for four, another emphatic stroke, before slicing a less deliberate boundary between second and fourth slip. Archer has bowled beautifully at Smith today - but he still hasn’t dismissed him in this series. Their battle has been a bit like Anderson v Kohli last summer.54th over: Australia 170-7 (Smith 66, Siddle 4) Siddle edges the hat-trick ball - an attempted yorker that turned into a low full toss - all along the ground for four. We talk a lot, probably too much, about what Sam Curran can’t do we should focus more on his priceless ability to make decisive contributions with bat and ball.That was a classic left-armer’s dismissal, a big inswinger that trapped Cummins in front as he pushed around his front pad. It was actually Steve Smith who encouraged Cummins to review, thinking it was missing leg. In fact it was hitting middle and leg, so Australia lose a review. More importantly, Sam Curran is on a hat-trick!What an awful review. I assumed he must have inside-edged it, because it was absolutely plumb. Cummins goes first ball - but he’s reviewed it!Well bowled Sam Curran! Paine tries to drive a tempting, full-length delivery that moves away a fraction to take the edge, and Bairstow does the rest. Curran has quietly had an excellent day.53rd over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) Smith gets a leading edge off Archer that lands safely on the off side. He’s had a fair bit of luck today, at least by his standards. The next ball whistles just past both the outside edge and the off stump Smith nods in appreciation. A maiden. Both players look like they are building towards another mighty head-to-head contest.52nd over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) A fine maiden from Curran to Paine. He has an LBW shout turned down - missing leg - and then slips one past the outside edge.“A ‘renaissance in fast bowling’,” sniffs Mark Dawson. “Really? The Aussies have a couple, which doesn’t help much when it comes to assessing Smith’s status. India now have one, who’s probably the best quick Indian bowler ever but hardly Holdingesque. England have Anderson and Broad, both excellent but I’d suggest also not in the McGrathMarshall class. Archer might be, and quite soon. Time always lends lustre, but I’m with Neil Thapa: today’s bowlers aren’t on the same level as those faced by Border, Ponting and Waugh. Which is not to disparage Smith: you can only beat, dispirit, and humiliate what’s in front of you.”India have a lot more than one, I would say, and South Africa had a very good attack when Smith faced them. He also averages around 100 against 90+mph deliveries. I was referring as much to the moving ball, which was previously his weakness. 51st over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) A bouncer from Archer to Smith beats everyone and goes for four wides. I missed much of that over as I was getting my hands dirty on Statsguru. Steve Smith’s current series average is 147.40, the highest in Ashes history (min: three innings). He’s fourth on the list as well.50th over: Australia 160-5 (Smith 66, Paine 0) You couldn’t make it up department: Steve Smith has been dropped by Joe Root! He flapped at a wide bouncer from Curran - it might have been a slower one - and edged it towards the slip. Root and Stokes both leapt towards the ball, and it hit Root’s right palm before falling to the ground.49th over: Australia 160-5 (Smith 66, Paine 0) Tim Paine survives a huge LBW shout first ball. It was sliding down, I think, and there might have been an inside edge as well. Still, it’s a wicket maiden from Archer, who now has 20 wickets at 17.45 in his debut Test series. “I should have got Brian Bolus as he was a Notts man at one time,” says John Starbuck of Robert Smithson’s list. “Nice to see Slasher Mackay in the list though his reputation disguised how dogged he must have been.”Slasher Mackay and Trevor Bailey is the great lost T20 partnership.

The latest moves come after dozens of US states launched privacy and antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a418a879bcc0ff139a65ce462c120443a1b3f393/0_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=728c0b02f4aef5dd4198c4f249629332","title":"youtube vanlifer jennelle eliana blazes trail solo female travellers","story":"Lo-fi videos about life on the road also fill blindspot travel industry has in catering for women of colourThe YouTube channel of a 21-year-old woman who lives in a van with her pet snake Alfredo is at the centre of a debate about race, travel and gender in the online world.Jennelle Eliana’s channel, which documents her day-to-day existence as a “vanlifer”, has become an internet phenomenon after gaining 1.9 million subscribers since June.“It really can happen overnight,” said Emily Hall, the campaign director at the Goat Agency, a marketing firm centred on social media influencers. “The interest in her is fuelled by the lifestyle that she’s putting out. If someone makes an alternative lifestyle look attainable and stands out on socials they can take off massively.”Eliana’s videos are simple and edited on her smartphone, with the 21-year-old showing subscribers around her converted 1995 GMC Vandura van and talking through the practicalities of life on the road, from taking a shower to dealing with break-ins.Her sudden rise led to conspiracy theories about how she became so popular so quickly. Chris Stokel-Walker, a journalist and author of YouTubers: How YouTube Shook Up TV and Created a New Generation of Stars, said although her rise has been meteoric, it is a lack of understanding around how the platform works that is fuelling the sceptics.“There is a dearth of information about how recommendations work on YouTube, so people assume it’s a manufactured success when it’s not,” he said. “She has that intangible mix of being cool and outdoorsy with a sense of adventure, coupled with an engaging and quirky personality. It’s that Beach Boys aesthetic meets Jack Kerouac but for 2019.”“Since 2016, uploads with ‘solo travel’ in the title have steadily increased year over year with 2019 proving to be the largest year yet,” said a YouTube spokesperson. “This year, out of the top 100 most viewed videos with ‘solo travel’ in the title, over 70 were uploaded by women.”The appeal to her Generation Z peers has been attributed to her lo-fi production values and focus on the more unglamorous sides of travel, according to the tech journalist Taylor Lorenz, who has written about Eliana. Her videos also chime with a move toward less manufactured, “authentic” online content favoured by younger viewers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.“It’s representative of an entire generation sticking their middle finger up to what women ‘should’ be doing,” said Eve Young, co-host of the Social Minds podcast. “The popularity of solo female travel is a real sign of the times: it connotes freedom, choice, financial independence and confidence.”Eliana’s sudden rise fits another emerging trend in the number of black women creating solo travel videos on YouTube. The platform says there are a “notable number of videos” from black female creators sharing their experiences of travelling among the most viewed in the solo travel category.The journalist Georgina Lawton says Eliana’s vlog and others like it fill a blindspot that the travel industry has traditionally had around catering for women of colour.“We’ve consistently been seen as a monolith by the UK travel industry,” said Lawton, , who is writing a guide to solo travel for women of colour. “Now when someone does something like Jennelle Eliana with her vanlife videos, it breaks the mould and it appeals to so many more people who think they can do it.”Lawton says she was inspired by Oneika Raymond, who started out as a vlogger before becoming a host on the Travel Channel. Part of the appeal for her of content made by black solo female travellers such as Oneika is that it helps bust myths about alternative forms of travel.“It’s nice when other people have made content because that alleviates my own fears,” said Lawton, who watched videos by other black solo female travellers before a trip to Russia. “I ask myself, what is the reception going to be like for a minority? These videos answer those questions.”“People are starting to recognise that YouTube is so massive that you can build a niche that people identify with,” said Stokel-Walker. “The thing is a niche interest on YouTube still means millions of views.”The interesting thing for him is what will happen next. He says Eliana and other successful YouTubers will quickly have to choose whether to accept commercial offers or reject them in order to retain their original appeal.“They build their audience on authenticity and then they get to a level when they become almost a traditional celebrity,” said Stokel-Walker, who expects brands to start throwing offers at Eliana. “And then the original appeal gets a lot harder to maintain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee6ea5e68ddd5999bccc2fd4ed3908e7317985db/1_0_5594_3357/master/5594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7ea7346066eec828a9c2b32c7929a5b","title":"turkish tv magnificent century dizi taking over world","story":"Shows such as Magnificent Century have come to rival US TV for international popularity, sweeping through the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. What explains their global success? By  Fatima Bhutto‘The first agreement we should make is: don’t call them soap operas,” Dr Arzu Ozturkmen, who teaches oral history at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, scolds me. “We are very much against this.” What Turkey produces for television are not soap operas, or telenovelas, or period dramas: they are dizi. They are a “genre in progress”, declares Ozturkmen, with unique narratives, use of space and musical scores. And they are very, very popular.Thanks to international sales and global viewership, Turkey is second only to the US in worldwide TV distribution – finding huge audiences in Russia, China, Korea and Latin America. At present, Chile is the largest consumer of dizi in terms of number of shows sold, while Mexico, then Argentina, pay the most to buy them.Dizi are sweeping epics, with each episode usually running to two hours or longer. Advertising time is cheap in Turkey and the state broadcasting watchdog mandates that every 20 minutes of content be broken up by seven minutes of commercials. Every dizi has its own original soundtrack, and can have up to 50 major characters. They tend to be filmed on location in the heart of historic Istanbul, using studios only when they must.Dizi storylines, which have covered everything from gang rape to scheming Ottoman queens, are “Dickens and the Brontë sisters”, I am told by Eset, a young Istanbul screenwriter and film-maker. “We tell at least two versions of the Cinderella story per year on Turkish TV. Sometimes Cinderella is a 35-year-old single woman with a child sometimes she’s a 22-year-old starving actress.” Eset, who worked on perhaps the most famous dizi, Magnificent Century, recounts the narrative themes that dizi are usually loyal to:Dizi are built, Eset insists, on the altar of “communal yearning”, both for the audience and the characters. “We want to see the good guy with the good girl, but, dammit, life is bad and there are bad characters around.”According to Izzet Pinto, the founder of the Istanbul-based Global Agency, which bills itself as the “world’s leading independent TV content distributor for global markets”, the upward course of dizi imperialism began with 2006’s Binbir Gece (1001 Nights). At the time, another Turkish show, Gümüs (Silver), was already a hit in the Middle East, but it was 1001 Nights that became a truly global success. Wherever 1001 Nights was sold – in almost 80 countries – it was a ratings smash.The show featured a blue-eyed Turkish dreamboat, Halit Ergenç, who would go on to star in the lead role of Magnificent Century. Based on the life of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 10th Ottoman Sultan, Magnificent Century told the story of the sultan’s love affair with a concubine named Hurrem, whom he married, in a major break with tradition. A largely unknown historical figure, Hurrem is believed to have been an Orthodox Christian from modern-day Ukraine.When it first aired in Turkey in 2011, Magnificent Century claimed one-third of the country’s TV audience. The foreign press called it an “Ottoman-era Sex and the City” and compared it to a real-life Game of Thrones. It had multiple historical consultants and a production team of 130, with 25 people working on costumes alone.Magnificent Century was so popular in the Middle East that Arab tourism to Istanbul skyrocketed. Turkey’s minister of culture and tourism even stopped charging certain Arab countries broadcasting fees. Global Agency estimates that, even without counting its most recent buyers in Latin America, Magnificent Century has been seen by more than 500 million people worldwide. It was the first dizi bought by Japan. Since 2002, about 150 Turkish dizi have been sold to more than 100 countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Bulgaria. It was Magnificent Century that blazed the way for others to follow.The international success of such dizi is just one sign of the way new forms of mass culture from the east – from Bollywood to K-pop – are challenging the dominance of American pop culture in the 21st century. Ergenç feels that the runaway success of the dizi is partly due to the fact that American TV is entertaining, but not moving. “They don’t touch the feelings that make us human,” he tells me, nursing a cold cup of coffee, when we meet in Istanbul. Turkey’s gaze was once keenly turned to the west, studying its films and television for clues about how to behave in a modern, fast-paced world, but today, American shows offer little guidance. “I was thinking of one American TV series – let’s not say its name. The philosophy of the series was being lonely. Being, um … ” – he searches for the polite word – “multi-partner at the same time, and searching for happiness. And all the people who were watching those series were very excited about it.” I can only guess he is referring to Sex and the City, but Ergenç doesn’t say. “That’s a tiring thing, isn’t it? Being alone, changing partners quickly and searching for happiness, and each time you search for it, it’s a failure. But it was in a very fancy world, so people were very interested. They’re spending and spending – spending their time, spending their love, spending everything.”The dizi that became global behemoths were powered by narratives that pitted traditional values and principles against the emotional and spiritual corruption of the modern world. Fatmagül’ün Suçu Ne? (What Is Fatmagül’s Fault?) centered on the gang rape of a young girl named Fatmagül and her battle for justice. It was a huge hit in Argentina, and in Spain its primetime slot drew close to a million viewers per episode. Fatmagül is soon to get a full Spanish telenovela remake, adapted to a daily, half-hour afternoon format.The show addresses a woman’s place in society, while subjecting her to myriad problems, from forced marriage to tense family relations to the suffocating power of the rich. But Fatmagül perseveres. She educates herself and defeats every hardship as she fights for, and receives, justice on all fronts: civil justice through the nation’s courts, ine justice through the punishment of her violators – and, of course, the justice of true love.Although dizi have dealt with abuse, rape and honour killings, by and large, Turkish men are portrayed as more romantic than Romeo. “They show people what they want to see,” Pinar Celikel, an Istanbul fashion editor tells me. “It’s not real.” Yet Eset argued that Fatmagül was groundbreaking in its approach to women’s issues. Previously, agents of change and the heroes of dizi stories were always men, but “Fatmagül didn’t accept women’s place as being subjugated, almost invisible”.It was such a persuasive vehicle for soft power that in 2012, Eset was hired by a “Republican American thinktank” to write a dizi telling the “good American story” of a woman in the Middle East out to enact positive change, “a woman who softens America’s image”. Eset declines to say which thinktank commissioned him, except to hint that a former Bush administration undersecretary was involved with the institute. “I wrote it,” Eset shrugs as he rolls a cigarette. “But they weren’t able to sell it.”I am standing in the drizzle in a bleak parking lot on the Asian side of Istanbul in front of a white van. A man named Ferhat hands me a Glock 19 pistol. It is the same model Turkish soldiers use, he says, as he swings open the van doors. Inside, there is a rocket-launcher lying on the floor and about 60 other weapons hanging on racks. Ferhat, who is ex-military, pulls out a “bad guy rifle” – an AK-47 – and a sniper rifle. Men in military uniform prowl across the parking lot. All around us there are street signs in Arabic and extras in cheap suits.We are on the set of Söz (The Oath), a new show made by Tims Productions, the company behind Magnificent Century. They are filming episode 38. A demolition expert saunters by, chatting to a man in a balaclava while an actor rehearses a scene, holding a rifle in each hand. Söz is a military dizi – a new sub-genre that is sweeping the nation. Although it is too early to have a sense of its global effect, Söz has already received remake offers from faraway markets including Mexico. Tims has always had an international outlook, I am told. They tried to cast Hollywood stars for Magnificent Century, and were reportedly close to signing Demi Moore to play a European princess until her orce from Ashton Kutcher got in the way.Of the five major channels in Turkey, each has one of these “soldier-glorifying” shows, Eset the screenwriter tells me later, and all the shows are “zeitgeist-relevant”. The baddies are either “internal enemies” or foreign villains. Söz takes place in a Turkey beset by violence and existential threats. Soldiers are everywhere, blazing through the wreckage of suicide bombings at shopping malls and hunting terrorists who are hard at work kidnapping pregnant women. In the first episode, after an attack on a mall, a soldier promises they will not rest until “we drain this swamp” – an eerily familiar refrain.Five minutes on the streets of Istanbul presents multiple encounters with women in headscarves, yet they are nowhere to be seen on screen. “They tried it,” Eset says, “but even the conservative folks don’t like to see conservative women on TV. You can’t get them to kiss, to stand up to their fathers, to run away, to do very much at all that would be considered drama.” Women in hijabs are almost never shown in television adverts, the journalist and novelist Ece Temelkuran tells me. Her diagnosis was clear: “This country is torn between these two pieces of cloth – flag and headscarf.”Back on the Söz set, as we move upstairs to a cold office building to watch a man pick up a phone for an hour while the demolition guys shoot glass windows in the corridor, I tell Selin Arat – director of international operations at Tims, and my guide for the day – that I watched an episode of Söz the previous night. Every time I looked down at my notebook, I explain, by the time I looked up again, everyone in the scene seemed to have been murdered. Who are the terrorists supposed to be? Arat, a delicate, strawberry-blond woman in a business suit, laughs. “It would be life-threatening if we knew who they were,” she jokes.Whoever the terrorists are, Söz is a hit. “It’s the first Turkish show that has surpassed one million subscribers on YouTube,” Arat notes proudly. Selling Söz outside Turkey may prove tougher, though. “We do want this show to be global,” says Timur Savcı, the founder of Tims Productions. “But right now not many countries are really interested in watching Turkish soldiers be glorified.” He pauses and smiles. “The US always makes shows and, at the end, they say: ‘God bless America.’ Well, God bless Turkey!”Savcı sits at his desk in the Levent district of Istanbul, as five TVs, all tuned to different channels, illuminate his spacious office. He sets the tone for the dizi industry at large and, today, he is preparing an English adaptation of Magnificent Century. He is not the least bit interested in taking American shows and remaking them in Turkish. “We are just making originals. It’s better!” he says with a big laugh.Dizi have yet to penetrate the English-speaking world. That could be because audiences in the US and UK don’t like to watch subtitled shows, Savcı muses, “or it could be the fact that this is about an Islamic state at the end of the day.” I ask if that is something Tims would tone down in the English version of Magnificent Century? Savcı, a jaunty, jovial man, shakes his head. “It’s important to remember that, at the time, the Ottoman Empire was the superpower of the world. What the US is now to the world is what the Ottoman was. If people look at it from this perspective, they would understand it more, but if they don’t know this, they would feel threatened.”Turks have been watching quality US TV since the 1970s. Turkish actors, such as Mert Fırat, told me they learned all their chops from the likes of Dallas and Dynasty. That was where they learned to emote, and to perform the melodrama that dizi require. But there was something lacking, something fundamental missing from those early guides to how to be rich and powerful in the modern world.Kivanç Tatlıtuğ, the star of the hit dizi Gümüs, among others, doesn’t feel it is necessarily a question of values or conservatism, but empathy. Over email, he told me why he thinks audiences around the world are turning to dizi over western productions. “Most of these audiences feel that their everyday stories are ‘underexplored’ by Hollywood and Europe,” Tatlıtuğ wrote. “This is ultimately a matter of ersity in storytelling. I understand the appeal of a story like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, these are both amazing TV shows. However, some people may also feel disenfranchised from these Hollywood themes, and may want to watch a story they can empathise with.”At the time of our meeting, Eset is working with a Turkish-American production house, Karga 7, which has global ambitions for their shows.“When I talk to people about Turkish TV series,” he tells me, “mainly they are taken by this romantic notion of family where everyone is trying to cherish one another. The dangers are external, and socio-economic class plays a great role in the love story of the poor boy loving a rich girl, or vice versa. Normally a story like this in the west would be treated through an inidual’s journey, where there is more sex, there is more violence, there are drugs.” Turkish TV has less of that. He points out that the couple in Fatmagül don’t kiss until about episode 58.In August 2017 in Beirut, I speak to Fadi Ismail, the general manager of the Middle East Broadcasting Center’s subsidiary O3 Productions, and the person responsible for bringing Turkish television to the Middle East. “To brag a bit,” Ismail corrects me with a laugh, “I’m the one who opened Turkish culture through TV to the whole world.” MBC is the biggest broadcaster in the Middle East and North Africa, home to almost 400 million people. MBC has a news channel, a children’s channel, a women’s channel, a Bollywood channel and a 24-hour drama channel on which it broadcasts Egyptian soaps, Korean dramas and Latin American telenovelas.In 2007, Ismail went to a buyer’s cinema festival in Turkey and chanced upon a tiny kiosk showing a local television series. “I stopped and watched it, not understanding anything,” he remembers. “But immediately I could visualise it as Arabic content. I replaced it in my mind with Arabic audio and everything else looked culturally, socially – even the food, the clothes, everything for me looked like us, and I thought: ‘Eureka!’”Ismail bought a Turkish series for his channel. He doesn’t remember the name of that first show, because they had already hit on the formula of giving everything – the title, the characters – new Arabic names. “Every one of these titles had ‘love’ in it, so I stopped differentiating. Love Something, Blue Love, Long Love, Short Love, Killing Love.” Gümüs – renamed Noor for the Middle East market – was the first big hit. Although the Egyptians had traditionally been known for their cinema, they also dominated TV across the region until Syria took over in the 1990s. Syrian actors were renowned for their dramatic and comedic skills. Their directors were artists. Talented scriptwriters produced shows of quality with substantial state help. The government poured money into the television industry, providing auteurs with cameras, equipment, state subsidies and permission to film in Syria’s historic sites. But then the war broke out and the country’s bright promise flickered. It was at this moment, Ismail says, that the Turks were ready to move in.As Syrian dramas had already become a “pan-Arab phenomenon”, MBC decided to dub all the Turkish dramas they bought into the Syrian Arabic dialect. “That is one of the reasons for their huge success,” Ismail concludes. “We dubbed the Turkish dramas with the most prevalent and established drama accent: Syrian.” Before Turkish dramas flooded Middle Eastern screens, people in Lebanon watched Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas. Though they were popular, they eventually ran out of steam for two reasons. The first was language. Telenovelas were dubbed into fusha, a standardised literary Arabic that is understood from Iraq to Sudan, and is used in newspapers, magazines and newscasts. Free from local accents and slang particular to each country, it is a formal, classical Arabic.The second was a question of values. “The Mexicans really did not resemble us at all,” says Imane Mezher, the format distribution and licensing coordinator of iMagic, a Beirut-based TV production company. iMagic makes Arabs Got Talent and the Middle East version of the X Factor, and experiments with new formats such as World Bellydance Championship, and an Islamically approved Extreme Makeover in which contestants don’t alter God’s design out of vanity, but have reconstructive surgery due to life-threatening issues.Mezher shakes her head at the memory of the telenovelas. “You have a daughter and you don’t know who her father is, you don’t know who the mother is. The stories were moral-free. At the end of the day, like it or not, we like things to be a little more conservative. The Turks are amazing at that. They are the real mix: the European freedom that everyone longs for and, at the same time, the problems are conservative, the same we face. The people have the same names as us, the same stories as us, and people love that.”Yet over the past 18 months, the international reach of Turkish TV has been significantly curtailed. At 1am, Saudi Arabian time on 2 March 2018, MBC took dizi off the air. Six dizi were pulled, at a cost to MBC of $25m. “There is a decision to remove all Turkish drama from several TV outlets in the region,” the channel’s spokesman said. “I can’t confirm who took the decision.”Since 2015, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been in negotiations to buy MBC, but found the $3bn asking price too high. In November 2017, MBS, as he is known, arrested most of MBC’s board and shareholders as part of what was billed as an anti-corruption sweep. After an 83-day stay in a luxury jail, MBC’s founder Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman whose sister was married to a former king, was released. His company now had a secret new majority owner, whose first order of business was to cancel all of MBC’s dizi programming.Before then, the Middle East and North Africa region accounted for the largest international consumption of dizi. Magnificent Century was advertised alongside Game of Thrones and Oprah in Dubai, while Ece Yörenç – Fatmagül’s scriptwriter – was asked by Saudi Arabia to write TV series for its local channels, and rumours circulated of princes and politicians inquiring after show plotlines during state visits to Turkey. It is possible that this kind of Turkish soft power irked MBS. And it is certain that he was infuriated by Turkey’s brazen flouting of his 2017 blockade of Qatar. Thus, in March 2018, MBS accused Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of trying to build a new “Ottoman caliphate”, included Turkey in what he bizarrely called a “triangle of evil”, and swiftly erased dizi from Middle Eastern TV.It is impossible to separate politics, both internal and geopolitical, from dizi’s upward momentum. Erdoğan himself was famously antagonistic to Magnificent Century, finding it too risque and not sufficiently versed in true Ottoman history. His government withdrew permission for its producers to film in historical sites such as Topkapı Palace, and Turkish Airlines pulled it from its in-flight entertainment systems in order to avoid government ire. A deputy from Erdoğan’s AKP party even went so far as to submit a parliamentary petition to legally ban the show.Although Magnificent Century has never been used by the state to project Turkish soft power to the world, other dizi have. Two more recent productions for TRT, Turkish state television, have the government’s wholehearted endorsement, if not their guidance. The first, Diriliş: Ertuğrul, or Resurrection: Ertuğrul, begins at the start of Ottoman glory, with Ertuğrul Ghazi, the father of Sultan Osman, the founder of the empire. The dizi’s tagline is “A nation’s awakening”, and for five seasons viewers have watched Ertuğrul battle crusaders, Mongols, Christian Byzantines and more. It has the honour of being the most popular show to air on state TV. “Until the lions start writing their own stories,” Erdoğan said of Ertuğrul, “their hunters will always be the heroes.”Another show, Payitaht Abdülhamid or The Last Emperor, bookends the Ottoman obsession: it is based on the last powerful Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II. It first aired in 2017, drawing in big numbers – every Friday, one in 10 television watchers tuned in as the sultan staved off rebellions by the Young Turks (who would eventually unseat him) and scheming European powers. Both supporters and detractors of the dizi pointed out that its portrayal of the sultan was modelled incredibly closely on Erdoğan. Followers of the Turkish president saw symbiosis between the two proud leaders who were unafraid to confront the west, and who dreamed of making Turkey central to pan-Muslim unity. Critics pointed out the two men’s paranoid reliance on intelligence services and an oppressive grip on power.By 2023, the Turkish government hopes dizi will pull in $1bn from exports. In his Istanbul glass office, İzzet Pinto, the founder of dizi distributor Global Agency, told me that $500m is a more realistic target given the loss of the Middle East market. But he foresees that remake rights, expansion in Latin America and the opening of western Europe – notably Italy and Spain – will help offset those losses.Over at Tims, Selin Arat predicts that Turkish series have reached a stable level of popularity. Demand might not grow much more, but there is a global hunger for what Turkish TV can offer. Arat concedes that the Saudi stance against dizi is a setback, but, he says: “It won’t be the end of the Turkish dizi invasion.”Adapted from New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop by Fatima Bhutto, published on 10 October by Columbia Global Reports, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02a43b05bc4428f1771a29f4a89bd2536884273/0_431_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ea105531de90d99a0850d67432ef658","title":"in god we trust display in kentucky schools marks effort to mix church and state","story":"The law now requires the words to appear in schools as conservative Christian groups seek to inject religion into public lifeWhen students returned to Kentucky public schools last month after summer vacation, they may have noticed something different: the words “In God We Trust” displayed in a prominent location in their school, as is now mandated by law.Kentucky’s law could seem innocuous enough after all, the words are the national motto and appear on American currency.But its critics say it is part of something bigger: a concerted, nationwide push by conservative Christian nationalist groups to inject religion into society and chisel away at the wall between church and state.The legislative effort Project Blitz is a coalition of three Christian nationalist groups, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which aims to “protect religious freedom, preserve America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and promote prayer”.In recent years, Project Blitz has pushed for state lawmakers to introduce bills like the “In God We Trust” one, as well as bills encouraging elective Bible classes in public schools. Over the last two years, six states have passed laws similar to Kentucky’s requiring the national motto to be displayed in schools.But the national motto and Bible class bills “are like the canaries in the coal mine”, said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.“They’re indicators of a larger effort, which has now been spelled out clearly in the Project Blitz strategy to ultimately reach these even more direct attacks on religious freedom,” she said.Project Blitz’s playbook, which is distributed to lawmakers, contains samples of cookie cutter legislation for lawmakers to introduce, as well as talking points for them to defend their positions. But in the playbook, the national motto and Bible class bills are only the first steps. Additional pieces of legislation include things like a proclamation of a Christian Heritage Week as well as legislation encouraging discrimination based on gender and sexual identity, such as a resolution “establishing public policy favoring adoption by intact, heterosexual, marriage-based families” and another “favoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples”.Americans United says there were 76 bills inspired by Project Blitz introduced in 26 state legislatures in 2018.Colin McNamara, an American Humanist Society staff attorney, calls Project Blitz “a conspiracy with receipts”.“It’s redefining religious liberty. It’s weaponizing religious liberty. It’s turning religious liberty into an unfettered right to discriminate,” he said. “The end goal of that is by doing that, you marginalize those groups that they don’t want to interact with and you entrench Christian nationalism and Christian privilege.”For Christian nationalists, Kentucky is an attractive beachhead, a place where powerful politicians are allies and where the population can be sympathetic. This is a state where it is not uncommon for prayers to be read at high school graduations. It is a state whose Republican governor, Matt Bevin, has encouraged “each and every” student in the state to participate in a “Bring Your Bible To School Day”. It is the same Kentucky where the county clerk Kim Davis became a cause celebre for the Christian right after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2015.In Kentucky, a Bible class bill and a national motto bill have been signed into law in recent years.Non-proselytising courses on the Bible were never forbidden in the country – and indeed, many schools in Kentucky and other states had Bible courses before any such law was passed. Kentucky’s law, like others, called for the creation of state regulations for schools that wanted to offer such a course. But when these bills get signed into law, they are often painted as the end of a prohibition.In endorsing Bible class bills this year, Trump seemed to amplify the sentiment that a prohibition was ending, tweeting: “Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!”McNamara says people like Trump and Bevin have made Christian nationalism – “the belief that this nation is and ought to be Christian”, as he puts it – mainstream at a time when white Christians are  a minority in America.“That used to be something that was a fringe rightwing belief,” he said. But “it has become a rallying cry for the rightwing in this country now. And it’s become this grand project.”In its playbook, Project Blitz acknowledges legislation like national motto bills are meant to pave the way for more ambitious goals.“Despite arguments that this type of legislation is not needed, measures such as the ‘In God We Trust’ bill can have enormous impact,” reads one section. “Even if it does not become law, it can still provide the basis to shore up later support for other governmental entities to support religious displays.”Bible class laws in Kentucky and other states require the courses not proselytize or endorse or disparage any one religion. But in practice, observers say, these courses are frequently unconstitutional.Analyzing documents obtained through open records requests in 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union found Bible classes at some Kentucky schools were tantamount to Sunday school, writing: “Many public schools that offer such courses purposefully use them as vehicles to proselytize students and involve them in religious activities.”The ACLU found that some classes were using lessons and worksheets taken from Sunday school websites while others used the Bible to impart life lessons and encouraged rote memorization of biblical text.The Barren county high school teacher Todd Steenbergen’s class was flagged by the ACLU for an assignment after a trip to a museum that asked students to write a letter encouraging a friend or family member to visit the museum, focusing their letter on describing an item from a religious exhibit and “why the reader needs to appreciate this”. The class was also flagged for a worksheet the ACLU said was only testing students’ knowledge of scripture without “probing any deeper into an academic or intellectual understanding of the Bible or its influences”.Writing to the , Steenbergen, who is also an adviser to the high school’s Fellowship of Christian Athletes group and includes a Bible quote in his email signature, said he removes his personal beliefs from the classroom. He compares how he handles the Bible class to how he handles speaking about different presidents as a history teacher.“I am quite confident that I teach in a way that abides by constitutional principles,” he said. “I do not consider my classroom as a different venue to preach a certain message. And, I am not a fan of certain groupspeople that want to make it so.”Teaching a Bible class that conforms with the constitution “is doable, but not easy”, says Mark Chancey, a professor of religious studies at Dallas, Texas’s Southern Methodist University and an expert on public school Bible classes.A lot of it comes down to training: a teacher may know the Bible, but if they have never studied it academically they could be prone to injecting their own biases and presenting parts as truth. Well-meaning teachers can also stumble upon curricula and course materials that were designed to evangelize.Concerns over the constitutionality of Bible classes can weigh heavily on teachers. At Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, the social studies teacher Corey Sayre pushed back against a scheduled Bible class he had volunteered to teach this year, eventually getting the school to replace it with a comparative religion class.Sayre, a religious Catholic who goes to church every week, told the  that while he believed he could teach the course within the confines of the constitution, it was something that would necessitate careful and constant attention. He also saw potential perils in teaching a non-devotional course.“I knew that teaching this within the confines of the first amendment was going to necessitate a critical examination that most parents would not love,” he said. “I knew that I was going to get killed from both sides.”When the Republican state representative Brandon Reed introduced legislation requiring “In God We Trust” be posted in Kentucky public schools last year, he made it clear that it was about getting God back in school.“In a time of rampant drug use, increased school violence, and mounting cases of suicide among our youth, we need God in our schools now more than ever,” he said.One year later and the words “In God We Trust” are now emblazoned in large, imposing letters over doorways and embossed on plaques in school lobbies.But in some school districts, there are signs of resistance.In Fayette county, Kentucky’s second-largest school district, administrators decided to comply with the law by displaying enlarged $1 bills, which include the national motto.At Jefferson county public schools, the state’s largest district with 169 schools in the Louisville area, administrators complied with the law by hanging up small posters offering more of a history lesson than a proclamation.“The phrase ‘In God We Trust’ first appeared on US coins in 1864, largely because of increased religious sentiment during the civil war,” small text reads on posters featuring the American flag and Statue of Liberty in the background. “The phrase later became the national motto and, in 1957, made it onto printed US bills.”Meanwhile, the superintendent of LaRue County public schools – Reed’s county and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln – told the  that its schools were hanging images of oversized pennies, which feature the words “In God We Trust” above Honest Abe’s head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f399b0f4acb7c17c83f660565bbaae3294d67e3f/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad307f4624da008445a04f8689e24c9","title":"ship of horrors deep sea fishing oyang 70 new zealand","story":"From bullying and sexual assault to squalid living conditions and forced labour, working at sea can be a grim business – and one deep-sea fishing fleet is particularly notorious. By  Ian UrbinaOn the night of 14 August 2010, the captain of a South Korean trawler, the Oyang 70, left Port Chalmers, New Zealand, for what would be his final journey. The ship was bound for fishing grounds about 400 miles east in the southern Pacific Ocean. When it arrived three days later, the captain, a 42-year-old man named Shin Hyeon-gi, ordered his crew to cast the net over the vessel’s rusty stern. As the men worked furiously on the illuminated deck, the ship soon began hoisting in thousands of pounds of a lithe, slender fish called southern blue whiting, which writhed and flapped across the deck. With each haul, the silvery mound of fish grew.A type of cod, blue whiting was sometimes ground up into fish sticks or imitation lobster. More often it was pelletised and sold as protein-rich food for farmed carnivorous fish such as salmon. At about 9¢ per pound, blue whiting was a low-price catch, which meant the Oyang 70 had to catch a lot to make a profit. As the crew pulled in the net, tonne after tonne of the fish slid to the deck – 39,000kg in all, a decent haul.The battered, 74 metre ship was long past its prime. The average age for distant-water fishing boats in the South Korean fleet was 29, and the Oyang 70 was 38 years old. Port captains called it “tender” – a euphemism for unstable. A month before it set sail, a New Zealand inspector ranked the ship as “high risk”, citing more than a dozen safety violations, including the fact that one of the ship’s main doors below deck was not watertight. The inspector later cleared the ship to sail after its operator claimed that all problems had been fixed.One of the Oyang’s unsolved problems was the man at the helm. Shin had replaced the previous captain, who fell overboard in a drunken stupor and drowned. When the ship cast its first net that day, Shin had been at the helm for nine months. Former crew members referred to him as an “angry man” – sullen, prone to screaming and almost always carrying around a bottle of clear liquid. Deckhands debated whether it was water or grain alcohol. None was reckless enough to ask.Shin drove his men hard. As the first net was pulled that night, they sorted the squirming, oily mound on the aft deck, quickly heaving the fish down a chute to the ship’s interior to make space for the next haul.One floor down, in the ship’s factory, more than a dozen men stood cramped before the “slime line”, a conveyor belt, wielding knives and operating circular saws. Their job was to remove heads, guts and bycatch, while the valuable part of the fish continued down the line for packing and freezing. The men needed roughly half a day to fully process the first catch. But before they made it through the load, Shin ordered the men on deck to put the net back in the water. Work continued almost nonstop over the next 24 hours.At about 3am on 18 August, the ship’s first mate frantically roused Shin from his sleep. The net was too full, the first mate told him. It was pulling the boat under. Water in the engine room was already several feet deep. The crew on deck was begging to cut the net.The captain jumped from his bunk and raced to the bridge. But instead of ordering the net cut, he demanded that the bosun, the man in charge of the deckhands, command them to keep hoisting. That order would be Shin’s last.For the Sajo Oyang Corporation, which operated the vessel, the poor treatment of workers and the dismal condition of its ship was nothing unusual. Time and again, Sajo Oyang abused its crew members, often treating them with the same disregard as the bycatch in its nets – as a distraction and annoyance. Sometimes, that disregard cost men their lives. The infamy of the Sajo Oyang fleet was well known in maritime circles.The vastness of the seas made it difficult to chase down bad actors – finding the criminals in the first place was often impossible. What stood out about the story of the Oyang ships was that safety risks and violations, and the persistent mistreatment of workers, were hiding in plain sight. But at every turn, inspectors and regulators largely shrugged off their responsibilities, often with a crass disdain for the lives at stake. Aside from the eight Korean officers, the crew of the Oyang 70 consisted of 36 Indonesians, six Filipinos and one Chinese. The officers derided the Muslims on board as “dogs” or “monkeys”. The drinking water was often brown and tasted of metal, workers would later tell investigators and lawyers. After a certain point, the only food on board for the crew was rice and the fish they caught. Men were docked pay if they ate too slowly. The crew described the ship as “a floating freezer” the heater on board barely worked. The shared toilet lacked running water. There were so many cockroaches that a crew member later said he could smell them cooking as they fell on to the hot engine block.The Oyang 70 was known as a stern trawler, towing a long, cylindrical net from behind. The ship’s most intense work happened in the dark, because blue whiting is a schooling fish that lives near the seabed, and is more easily caught at night, when it feeds on plankton, small shrimp and krill closer to the surface.As the crew struggled with the net on 18 August, everyone on board knew it was more fish than the boat could handle. No one knew by how much, though, because there were no batteries in the net’s weight sensors. The cost of replacing the ship’s trawl net was more than $150,000. The price of losing a net full of fish would be the captain’s job.As the net was winched up the stern ramp in the early morning darkness, it looked like a monstrous whale. At the chute, the net mouth opened and the whale regurgitated a flood of fish, so much that the hold soon clogged. The closed end, or “cod” end, of the net stretched down into the sea behind them. Trailing the ship, this mesh cylinder stretched nearly 30 metres. At the far end underwater, the net bulged to cover an area the size of six tennis courts. More than five tonnes of fish were on the ship’s slipway, while around another 100 tonnes remained underwater – easily worth more than $20,000.Other captains would later testify that this catch was more than double the size of a “bag” that they would have been willing to pull on to a ship of its size. Behind the ship, the bloated net began dragging the Oyang 70’s rudder deep underwater, jutting its bow awkwardly toward the inky sky.Most captains would have immediately identified how dangerous the situation had become. It takes a rare, almost instinctual calm and spatial acuity to steady a ship of this size while reading the tides, countering gusts and directing a dozen men scrambling on deck. This is especially true when hoisting a large, heavy net, which has to be carefully centered behind the ship.Shin lacked this instinct. He was not calm, nor was his ship stable in the best of circumstances, and certainly not when his net suddenly slipped to the port side, abruptly tipping the Oyang 70 to a 15-degree list. In the factory below deck, the men on the slime line continued working, even as the ship tilted and as the water rose to their knees. In a desperate attempt to right the ship, Shin ordered some of the men to move any heavy equipment they could budge to starboard and tether it there.But the list remained, and water began rushing in through the open “offal chute”, a port-side door for expelling fish guts and heads into the ocean. At the same time, dead fish and debris clogged the ship’s scuppers, trapping on board the water that should have drained off. The door to the engine room below, which also should have been sealed, was open. So, too, was the fish hold.Everything began flowing in the wrong direction. Water bubbled up through floor drains and sprayed in through portholes, and walls became waterfalls. The ability of a boat to flush its decks is as essential as humans’ ability to breathe. Water always needs to be leaving the vessel faster than it is entering. When it’s not, problems multiply quickly. The crew had stacked flattened cardboard boxes over the generator in a futile effort to protect it from the water coming in from above. Soon, the drainage pumps shut off. Even before the Oyang 70 began taking on water, the ship was off-kilter because the captain had ordered most of the boxed fish to be stacked in one hold, rather than spread across two. The ship’s fuel tanks had not been filled to maximum, adding to the Oyang’s instability because of internal sloshing.At about 4am, a heated argument erupted on the bridge. The chief engineer was in tears and screaming in Korean at the captain, pleading with him to cut the net. The captain finally gave in. The bosun put on a harness and shimmied on to a section of the mesh, knife in hand. Other crewmen followed, all slashing frantically at the net. Too little, too late – the ship continued to roll over.What had been obvious before was now unavoidable: the Oyang 70 was going down. Chaos overtook the ship. On the bridge, Shin made a distress call on the VHF radio. Men began leaping into the sea. Only the Korean officers wore life jackets. The Oyang’s rescue boat was in the water. But it, too, had been overturned by the waves.The water temperature before dawn that morning was about 6C. The ship had 68 survival suits, designed to insulate against the cold – more than enough for the 51 men on board. None of the crew put one on. It is unclear if any of them knew how.Greed, not water, sank the Oyang 70. The ship had tried to swallow too much fish the ocean swallowed the ship instead. The last men off the drowning ship said that they saw Shin in the wheelhouse, refusing to abandon his post or put on a life jacket. Hugging a pole and clutching his clear bottle, he was muttering in Korean and crying. The Amaltal Atlantis, a New Zealand-flagged fishing boat, heard the VHF call and headed to the scene, arriving an hour later. Much later and the 45 men it rescued would likely have frozen or drowned.Several of the survivors suffered acute hypothermia. Rescuers never recovered the captain’s body. Among the five other crew members who died, three were found frozen, floating in a lifeboat. On land, a preventable disaster like this might have spelled the end of a company. Not so on the open ocean.In the world of deep-sea fishing, the Sajo Group is a leviathan. Founded in 1971, the group oversees a huge fleet of more than 70 fishing ships. The company’s slogan is “Nature is delicious”. By 2010, the group had made more than $1bn in annual revenue, millions of dollars of which came from fish pulled from New Zealand waters.The Sajo Oyang’s corporate presence in New Zealand was structured like Russian dolls: larger companies enveloping subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of subsidiaries. The men who worked on the boats were recruited and contracted not by the Sajo Oyang company directly, but by agencies based in Indonesia, Myanmar, South Korea and elsewhere. By outsourcing the recruitment, logistics and payroll of foreign crews, the company centralised profits and decentralised liability.The sinking of the Oyang 70 made headline news in New Zealand. To handle damage control, the company tapped a pugnacious lobbyist and spokesman named Glenn Inwood, who was famous for representing several other controversial industries, such as whaling and tobacco.About eight months after the Oyang 70 sank, its replacement, the Oyang 75, arrived at Lyttelton Port in New Zealand. Shortly before it departed again for the fishing grounds, Inwood gave reporters a tour of the new vessel, which he hailed as a model of the highest labour and fishing standards. But even Sajo Oyang’s deft fixer couldn’t control the publicity surrounding what happened next. Early on the cold morning of 20 June 2011, a parishioner went to her church in Lyttelton, where she discovered 32 Indonesian men hiding in the nave. Shivering and distraught, the Indonesian men had fled the “model” Oyang 75 while the ship was being unloaded.Waking up at about 4am, the Indonesians had snuck off the ship while the captain was still asleep. Because they were Muslim, the men had wandered the streets looking for a mosque finding none, they took refuge in the church instead.One by one, the men described to church officials and later to government investigators their captivity on a ship of horrors. A chief engineer broke a deckhand’s nose for inadvertently bumping into him. Another officer punched a crew member in the head so often that he lost part of his vision. Insubordinate crew were sometimes locked in the refrigerator. Others were forced to eat rotten fish bait. On good days, shifts lasted 20 hours. Sometimes they worked for 48 hours straight. “I often thought about asking for help,” Andi Sukendar, one of the Indonesian deckhands, said in court papers. “But I didn’t know who to ask.”The worst part, the men said, was the sexual assaults, mostly at the hands of a sadistic bosun who would steal their clothing as they bathed so that he could chase them as they ran naked back to their bunks. In the galley, he approached the men from behind and jabbed them with his exposed erection. When they passed him in the halls, he grabbed their genitals. Other Korean officers made advances, the crewmen said, but none were as aggressive as the bosun. He assaulted deckhands while they showered. He climbed into their bunks at night when they were sleeping.“The bosun tried to teach me how to have sex with him but I refused,” one crew member recounted. Others were not able to stave him off.I wish I could say I was surprised by these reports. But what I read was sickeningly familiar. The expanse of the sea and the dictatorial power of officers over crews allow abusive behaviour that is often only uncovered when a ship sinks.As police interviewed the Oyang 75’s crew in Lyttelton, the ship’s owner refused to pay for their accommodation or food, claiming that they no longer worked for him. The bosun was fired and quickly sent back to Korea, avoiding prosecution in New Zealand. The people in Indonesia who had recruited the men to the ships repeatedly called the crew members’ families, pressuring them to be quiet and not talk to reporters or lawyers.Over the next year, a New Zealand journalist, Michael Field, and two University of Auckland researchers, Christina Stringer and Glenn Simmons, investigated further. Interviewing dozens of crewmen from several Sajo Oyang company vessels and hundreds of men from other foreign ships fishing in New Zealand waters, they revealed a broad pattern of abuse.Beyond the abhorrent working conditions on its ships, the Oyang fleet was putting entire ecosystems at risk with its fishing practices. One ship was impounded in Russia for illegal fishing and later fined in New Zealand for discharging thousands of gallons of used engine oil into the sea. Two other Sajo Oyang ships had been caught in New Zealand’s waters dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of fish overboard, a practice known as high-grading, used to circumvent catch quotas and make room for fresher or more valuable fish.Meanwhile, workers on Sajo Oyang ships described meals speckled with dead bugs and mattresses riddled with biting mites, men hiding in closets from violent officers, and rapes that occurred in nearby bunks that they felt powerless to stop. Crewmen recounted being issued torn hand-me-downs and ill-fitting boots, tattered jackets and gloves. Captains kept the sailors’ passports and certification papers to ensure they could not leave.On one of the company’s other ships in New Zealand’s waters, a deckhand accidentally crushed his finger under a heavy roll of rope. When it was later amputated, he was sent immediately back to work below deck, causing his wound to reopen. He woke up at night to find cockroaches crawling on it, drawn by the dried blood. An engineer told investigators that the crew was only allowed to wash garments with seawater in bags used for fish processing, leaving him little choice but to wear rancid-smelling work clothes every day. Another man who worked in the ship’s storage area described food flecked with bugs he ate it anyway, because he was so hungry.The story of the Oyang fleet was also a story about entrapment. Why did men take these jobs? Once they saw how bad the conditions were, why didn’t they flee immediately?Most of the crew members on the Sajo Oyang ships were from Tegal in central Java, Indonesia, and had been recruited by through an intricate system of debt bondage. They had signed contracts in English, a language they did not speak. Typically, their salary was about US$235 per month – a fraction of the minimum wage required under law, at least while they worked in New Zealand’s waters.Breaching the contracts would bring economic ruin to their families. One deckhand on another vessel, the Oyang 77, put up his elementary and junior high school graduation certificates. In his small village, such records are irreplaceable. If he failed to get the papers back, he would be unemployable. The documents were “the only things of value he had”, one affidavit said.News of the scams and abuse in this work rarely made it back to the small villages where new crew members were recruited, because those who had been tricked were too ashamed to talk about it or to warn others. Even those who knew the risks were willing to try their luck, because they were desperate for work.As the conditions on these ships came to light in New Zealand, the public was horrified and lawmakers began cracking down. The fishing industry went on the offensive. Inwood, the industry’s all-purpose fixer, led the charge, arguing that working long hours was a standard practice on all fishing ships. The failure to pay wages was the fault not of the Sajo Oyang company but of manning agents in Indonesia who were responsible for handling such matters. Koreans tend to be more physical and vocal than Indonesians, he argued. Some of the abuse allegations on the ships were supposedly misunderstandings stemming from these cultural differences.“During its entire period of operating in New Zealand, Sajo Oyang, its officers, crew and representatives have never been the subject of a prosecution,” Inwood wrote in a letter to the editor of a New Zealand newspaper in July 2012. “That is a rare accomplishment in an industry as highly regulated as the New Zealand fishing industry.”Other fishing companies argued that the problems in the Sajo Oyang fleet were isolated and should not be used to justify new regulations. Meanwhile, the Sajo Oyang company worked to protect its brand.While reporting in Auckland in the spring of 2017, I met with Christina Stringer, one of the two University of Auckland researchers who had brought to light many of the abuses in New Zealand’s waters. She recounted how, at one point during her investigation into foreign fishing fleets, she and her research partner, Glenn Simmons, were dining at a local Chinese restaurant with several Indonesian crew members from one of the Oyang ships. The men were living in safe houses at the time and, having no income, were dependent on the kindness of strangers to eat. The former boss of the crew happened to be dining at the same restaurant, and after he took pictures of the crew with his cell phone and made some calls, a group of men appeared outside the restaurant, glaring at the crew as they waited for them to leave. Simmons hustled the crew to a car out the back and managed to lose the group, though not without a chase.The company had good reason to fight the bad publicity. The New Zealand government had begun issuing fines: NZ$420,000 for the Oyang 75’s dumping of low-value catches to replace them with more valuable fish, NZ$10,500 for illegally dumping oil at sea, and NZ$120,000 for when the Oyang 77 tossed more than 50 tonnes of fish overboard.Pressure was also mounting from abroad. The US State Department released its annual Trafficking in Persons Report in June 2012, which explicitly faulted New Zealand for poor treatment of foreign fishing workers. In response, New Zealand took a drastic step. In August 2014, the parliament passed a law expelling all foreign fishing vessels from its national waters. Fishing companies had two years to comply, and were given the option of “reflagging” to New Zealand and operating under its full legal jurisdiction.The law was meant to better protect the roughly 1,500 foreign nationals working on foreign-chartered vessels in its waters by forcing these ships to comply with New Zealand’s labour standards. It was a bold move, because it would cost New Zealand hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment as fishing companies moved elsewhere rather than shoulder the added burden and cost of the new regulations. To fish in New Zealand’s waters, all crew had to be provided with access to personalised bank accounts in which to deposit wages, observers would be required on virtually all foreign-owned fishing vessels, and there would be independent audits of wages.The existence of forced labour on fishing ships was not a revelation. Stories of sea slavery had been reported for more than a decade on boats from Thailand, Taiwan and elsewhere. But no country had ever acted as aggressively as New Zealand did in response.Still, seafarer unions and lawyers for the fishing boat workers questioned whether the government had gone far enough. They argued that the effect of New Zealand’s law would be to push bad behaviour elsewhere as the worst scofflaws simply opted to leave New Zealand’s waters and set up shop in jurisdictions that exert even less control over foreign fishing fleets. The Oyang 75 subsequently travelled to east Africa, near Mauritius, while the Oyang 77 sailed to an area near the Falkland Islands. The horrors that repeatedly befell the hapless crews of Sajo Oyang ships were infuriating and tragic. More importantly, though, they illustrated the chaotic, desultory nature of maritime regulation. Forcing companies to follow labour laws, to observe fishing regulations and to abide by national boundaries requires robust enforcement regimens, constant vigilance and a dogged dedication to a higher legal – if not moral – code. But usually, it requires something else, too, an ingredient that is often missing: participation and cooperation of the men on the receiving end of abuse.Before one of the investigators left the Oyang 75, one of the workers on board, a 28-year-old Indonesian man named Purwanto, pulled him aside. Purwanto seemed genuinely puzzled why anyone would take an interest in the conditions of his work, whether he was satisfied and paid. “No one has ever asked about us before,” said Purwanto, who had been working on the ship for a year. “Why do you want to know about life on the ship?” he asked. The investigator and the union inspector responded that they were simply checking for labour violations. Purwanto said that even if there were violations, it didn’t matter – he needed the job, so he would not say anything more. There was nothing else for him back in Indonesia, he said. “This is the best we can get.”This is an edited extract from The Outlaw Ocean: Crime and Survival in the Last Untamed Frontier by Ian Urbina, published by The Bodley Head on 19 September and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7dac68f230759cc3de87c2561baca3c435ac0b9/0_177_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c21418b098ffa0a717ecee07efa7b59","title":"end of golden age amsterdam museum bans term from exhibits","story":"Debate over Netherlands’ colonial past resurfaces with switch to ‘17th century’ as alternativeOne of the Netherlands’ most prestigious museums has fuelled fresh debate over the the country’s colonial past by deciding it will no longer use the term Golden Age to describe the 17th century when it was at its pinnacle as a military and trading power.The Amsterdam Museum said that in an attempt to be “polyphonic and inclusive”, the common description of the century in which the Netherlands bestrode the world stage would be banned from its exhibits.The museum said the term Gouden Eeuw did not do justice to those who were exploited during the era in which the Netherlands was at the forefront of scientific discovery and artistic achievement.Tom van der Molen, the curator of the 17th century at the museum, said: “The Golden Age occupies an important place in Western historiography that is strongly linked to national pride. But positive associations with the term such as prosperity, peace, opulence and innocence do not cover the charge of historical reality in this period. The term ignores the many negative sides of the 17th century such as poverty, war, forced labour and human trafficking.”The museum said the term would not be used in future exhibitions and that the name of the museum’s permanent collection will be changed from Dutch in the Golden Age to Group Portraits of the 17th Century.The treatment of the Dutch colonial period in public spaces has become a matter for keenly contested debate in recent years with street names changed and questions raised about the relevance of statues celebrating military heroes of the past.When the Mauritshuis museum, which is home to a host of national treasures including Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring, removed a bust of its namesake from the museum’s foyer in 2018, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned against “judging the distant past through today’s eyes”.Count Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, a cousin of the Prince of Orange, was governor of the Dutch colony in Brazil in the 1630s.In response to the Amsterdam Museum’s decision, Zohair el Yassini, an MP for the governing centre-right VVD party, said the institution had “lost the plot completely”.He told De Telegraaf: “First we had to change the street signs, then the statues had to go and now the whole Golden Age is for the scrapheap? It’s a bit cowardly to want to rewrite history.”Michel Rog, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic Appeal party, said: “This name change is a hyper-correct idea of ​​the Amsterdam elite and actually too ridiculous for words. “Erasing the past is nonsense. Just explain that the Golden Age also had negative sides. There is nothing wrong with that. Just like a little national pride. Nothing wrong with that either.”As part of its move to broaden its coverage of history, the Amsterdam Museum is holding a symposium this month about untold stories from the 17th century. It will open with an exhibition entitled Dutch Masters Reviewed, about 13 Amsterdam residents and visitors of colour from the 17th and 18th centuries.Judikje Kiers, the museum’s director, told the daily newspaper Het Parool: “These are important steps in a long process, but we are not there yet. We will continue to work with people in the city to uncover underexposed stories and perspectives of our shared history.”The Rijksmuseum, another of the Netherlands’ most high-profile museums, said it would continue to use the term Golden Age. The institution’s director, Taco Dibbits, told the broadcaster NOS: “The name refers to a period in history of great prosperity. That does not alter the fact that we acknowledge the dark side of this. The Rijksmuseum approaches history from different perspectives. For example, we are opening an exhibition on slavery next year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c61f4e99a4b242b05d2a2188e23fa2eea04848/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f1b81d772134fc3eba4d2d72bdd7a6","title":"juan guaido faces questions over links to organised groups","story":"Opposition leader plays down images but analysts say they could prove highly damagingJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan politician fighting to topple Nicolás Maduro, is facing awkward questions about his relationship with organised crime after the publication of compromising photographs showing him with two Colombian paramilitaries.In an interview on Friday, Guaidó played down the significance of the pictures, in which he posed alongside two members of the Colombian criminal gang the Rastrojos identified as El Brother and El Menor.The photos appear to have been taken on 22 February as Guaidó used an illegal border crossing to sneak across Venezuela’s western border into Colombia to attend a Live Aid-style concert in the town of Cúcuta.“I took hundreds of photos that day,” Guaidó told the Colombian broadcaster Blu Radio. “It was hard to know who was asking for a photo. Misconstruing these photos means playing the Maduro regime’s game.”But analysts said the images had the potential to cause severe harm to Guaidó’s credibility and his nine-month quest to force Maduro from power.The Rastrojos are a drug-trafficking group with paramilitary origins who operate on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border. As well as the cocaine trade, they are engaged in illegal mining, kidnapping for ransom and extortion.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group, said: “I think it is extremely damaging. Regardless of whether this was as innocent as they claim – which is rather hard to believe – or whether there was something more to it, it looks so bad.”Gunson said the photos handed “a huge propaganda victory” to Maduro’s government, which is fending off accusations of ties to leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.Maduro sought to exploit the scandal on Thursday, claiming the images were definitive evidence of Guaidó’s ties to “paracos, murderers and narco-traffickers”.In a televised speech, Maduro declared: “The connection between Colombian narco-trafficking and the Venezuelan right is right there in the photo. No one can deny it.”Gunson said that whatever the truth, the photos showed “unbelievable naivety” and were an embarrassment to the international coalition backing Guaidó, which includes the US, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.“It could almost not have come at a worse time for Guaidó,” Gunson said, pointing to the Colombian government’s plans to denounce Maduro’s ties to leftist guerrillas at the UN general assembly later this month.The photos were published on Thursday by Wilfredo Cañizales, the director of a human rights group in Cúcuta, where February’s highly politicised concert was held.Speaking to the , Cañizales claimed the Rastrojos had imposed a curfew along the border before Guaidó’s crossing into Colombia “to make sure no locals would take photos of him crossing illegally through the hidden paths”.Cañizales declined to say how he had obtained the photos or why he had decided to publish them but said: “The Rastrojos are paramilitaries. They are the ones in this region who decide who lives and who dies.”Gunson said the photos also posed uncomfortable questions for Guaidó’s backers in the Colombian government and their possible links with paramilitary groups. “There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c84534d56d2e9bed9974674d7bb54e1c83f71a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b9a77395a452082df6ead360f242bf","title":"judge who convicted geoffrey boycott i stand by my verdict","story":"‘I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,’ says French judge The French judge who convicted Geoffrey Boycott of assaulting his girlfriend has criticised the former England cricketer after he was knighted and says she stands by her decision to find him guilty.The move to award Boycott the honour prompted outrage this week from a domestic violence charity. He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times.Boycott, who has always denied the offence, said he “couldn’t give a toss” about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice.But after being tracked down by the  in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott’s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been “arrogant” and “deplorable”.“I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,” she said. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. Now that I’m really shocked at. He doesn’t deserve it.“As far as French justice is concerned, he has been found guilty of having beaten his partner three times.”The retired judge said: “I remember this case very well and I remember the row about it even after 20 years. I saw all the photos, the evidence, the statements and if I didn’t think he was guilty I wouldn’t have convicted him.” Boycott was fined £5,300 and given a three-month suspended jail sentence, upheld by a second court on appeal. He was also ordered to pay a symbolic one franc in compensation to Moore.The 78-year-old former England captain, who has been commentating for Channel 5 and BBC Radio 5 Live during this summer’s Ashes series, has always denied the charges and claimed Moore was a “woman scorned” exacting her revenge.“Boycott was most definitely not a gentleman,” Haumant said. “He told one of the opposing lawyers to shut up during the hearing. That was extremely vulgar and not something you say during a hearing. I can’t imagine a judge in your country allowing that, and I wouldn’t allow it.”“He claimed it was an accident, but, as I say, if I convicted him it was because I thought he was guilty and I stand by that. He appealed and my judgment was upheld by the appeal court.“It is more than 20 years ago, but I still remember his behaviour in the courtroom. He was arrogant and he had a deplorable attitude throughout the trial.”After he was convicted in the court in Grasse, on the Côte d’Azur, Boycott took a swipe at the French judge, saying he was not entirely surprised to be found guilty “in view of the way the trial was conducted”. He claimed that unlike the UK, the legal system in France rested on the principle of “guilty until proven innocent”.He said he did not care about condemnation of his honour from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women’s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May’s resignation honours list as “extremely disappointing”, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: “I don’t give a toss about her, love.”The French legal system, like the British, is based on the principle that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. All but the most serious crimes and offences, those carrying a prison sentence of 10 years or more, are tried without a jury.People are not “charged” with a crime or offence in France, they are “put under investigation”. Before the case comes to trial, an investigating magistrate known as a juge d’instruction tells police to collect evidence and takes witness statements to produce a case file to determine whether an offence has been committed.If the magistrate decides there is no charge to answer, the case is classé, or dropped. If the magistrate decides there is a case to answer, the person is sent to trial and the file, available to the lawyers of all interested parties, is presented to the trial judge.There were three hearings in the Moore v Boycott case. He was first convicted of assault in January 1998 by judge Marc Juando at a court in Grasse. He was not present for the hearing and appealed successfully to have the verdict set aside. Haumant presided over a second trial in Grasse in November 1998 that confirmed the verdict of the first. Boycott appealed and a panel of three judges upheld the conviction in May 2000.The November 1998 trial was long and at times chaotic. Boycott was said to have flown 13 witnesses to the south of France at an estimated cost of more than £200,000, but many appeared to have nothing to say directly about the accusations. They included a psychiatrist who had never met Moore but gave his interpretation of her behaviour from television clips and conversations with her former husband.Haumant remembers sitting until the early hours of the morning hearing witnesses, many of them appearing for Boycott, all of whose testimony had to be translated. “It was a long trial, but then there were a lot of witnesses, most of them for the defendant,” she said.The verdict in January had been set aside because Boycott failed to turn up to the brief hearing, explaining he was on tour commentating on Test matches in South Africa.Boycott and Moore were staying at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes in October 1996 when they argued. Moore was reported to have become even more furious when she returned to their hotel room to find Boycott packing for an early flight back to the UK.He claimed she had slipped in the ensuing fracas while throwing his clothing and belongings out of the window.Moore said he had attacked her, holding her to the ground and staring at her with “wild, piercing and manic” eyes as he hit her.In her seven-page written explanation of her verdict, Haumant, who told British journalists covering the trial that her hero was the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, made it clear she was not impressed with Boycott’s behaviour in or out of court.“In the court, the accused didn’t hesitate to interrupt Mrs Moore’s lawyer rudely, tarnishing the image of the perfect gentleman which he brought his old friends and witnesses to testify to,” she wrote at the time. She said the evidence presented to the court “does not support the theory of an accidental fall” and ruled that Moore had been the victim of “purposeful blows”.Boycott accused Moore of blackmailing him to settle for a large sum of money, but she said it was never about cash. She asked for and was awarded the symbolic one franc damages. Boycott, labelled a woman-beater and criminal, found it difficult to shake off the stain on his reputation, even when Moore’s former solicitor Sue Sims-Steward said Moore saw Boycott as a way of solving financial problems and portrayed the victim as a difficult woman who could “turn on the tears at will”.“It’s no surprise to me that he’s been given an honour,” said Haumant. “I remember reading a profile of Theresa May in the French magazine l’Express when she said her great idol was not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but Geoffrey Boycott.“On the other hand it is surprising because of what he did,” she said.“I was heavily criticised for my judgment to the point I worried that I’d better not go to the UK because I wouldn’t be safe in the street. I remember an article that made fun of me for not knowing anything about cricket, but why would I?”A spokesman for Boycott did not comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fe4b365fa53b7c435cd14d882365c99c308cf8/0_211_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be2151eed25d0f92e227fb59f73d3a28","title":"science on safety of chlorinated chicken misunderstood","story":"Government’s assurances that there are no health problems are misleading, say food policy expertsThe government has misunderstood the science on the safety of chlorinated chicken, a group of senior food policy experts has said.It has also failed to give watertight commitments that it would not be sold here after a no-deal Brexit, they warn.The experts have written to all MPs to warn that the British public is being “softened up” to accept chlorinated chicken and other food produced under US safety standards, despite it posing a danger to health.In a briefing from the Centre for Food Policy, timed to reach MPs before party conferences, they argue that recent assurances by a government chief scientist were misleading, and a no-deal Brexit could open the door to unsafe food.Prof Sir Ian Boyd, the outgoing chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said in an interview two weeks ago there were “no health problems” with chlorinated chicken and its consumption should be a matter of “consumer choice” rather than government policy.But the academics point to research published last year which found washing food in bleach does not kill many of the pathogens that cause food poisoning. Instead, it sends them into a “viable but non-culturable state”, which means they are not picked up in standard tests, which take a sample of the food and try to culture any germs on it.The presence of the pathogens is thus masked by the bleach, but they are still dangerous to human health.He said a no-deal Brexit would increase the pressure for the UK to accept food from abroad produced to US standards, especially if shortages raised prices, and warned that current laws on labelling were inadequate.Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City Universityand also a co-author, said the government was “wriggling” over the definitions of safety. “For the chief scientist at Defra to say what he did is not accidental,” he said.Robert Wood Johnson, the US ambassador, responded to the : “Sir Ian Boyd is absolutely right: American food safety standards are second to none. The EU’s scientists have said antimicrobial washes are the most effective and economical way to deal with potentially lethal bacteria like salmonella and campylobacter. The World Health Organisation found North America has the lowest incidence of foodborne illness anywhere in the world. A comprehensive free-trade agreement that includes agriculture will create more opportunity, greater choices and wider prosperity for both British and American farmers and consumers.”His clear signal that agriculture should be part of a trade deal faces ministers with difficult choices. Farmers fear being undercut by lower-standard imports, while supermarkets are concerned that they will be blamed over any future food safety scares.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, told the : “Even if we leave the EU with a deal, there is a very real risk that we will have to compete with food imports that have been produced using methods and products that would be illegal on British farms. We need a clear commitment from government that it will set up a trade and standards commission to provide certainty for both farmers and the British public that our values of food production will be respected post-Brexit.”A spokesperson for Defra stopped short of an explicit commitment on chlorinated chicken, or that EU standards would be maintained: “We have been clear that any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies. Without exception, imports will meet our stringent food safety standards. After EU exit, the UK will decide how we set and maintain our own standards and regulations.”Gareth Morgan, head of farming and land use policy at the Soil Association, warned that consumers would face issues beyond food safety: “The notion that chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef are “safe” misses the point. These practices prop up inherently unsafe industrial farming systems with terrible welfare standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88af6382fecd2c62dc17c54d37c5a42f185ca207/0_184_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94312dd29d7a85ff21c2bc1f9078402b","title":"tunisia berlusconi wild card nation goes to polls nabil karoui","story":"Jailed Nabil Karoui hopes to appeal to voters disillusioned by lack of progress since Arab springCampaigning ends on Friday in Tunisia’s presidential election before Sunday’s first round of voting, pitting more than two dozen candidates against each other, including a media mogul running for office from jail.Tunisia is the last of the Arab spring countries still on a democratic track, after Egypt slipped back toward authoritarianism and Syria and Libya descended into conflict.The jailed Nabil Karoui, one of the leading candidates, started a hunger strike this week. He is owner of the unlicensed Nessma TV channel, which he has used to promote his political ambitions. He was detained in August on suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering, charges that his supporters say are politically motivated.His detention is a wild card in the long-running struggle for political supremacy in the young democracy, which has pitted the moderate Islamist Ennahda party against the increasingly splintered anti-Islamist opposition.Karoui’s appeal has been pitched against a sense of growing disillusionment with the country’s main political leaders, who have failed to improve the lives of ordinary citizens since the country launched the Arab spring in 2011 by toppling of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.Karoui is sometimes depicted as Tunisia’s equivalent of Silvio Berlusconi. In reality, however, he is more like the wealthy paterfamilias in a Middle Eastern soap opera, a man touched by both tragedy and success – an image he has skilfully communicated to a key impoverished section of Tunisian society that has until now been detached from the main political trends.He has used his TV channel to air images of himself delivering aid from a family charity to the poor, a slick and sometimes populist figure in comparison with his rivals.The wealthy secular political elite, which he once backed, now see him as a threat, while some on the Islamist side have still not forgiven him for screening Marjane Satrapi’s Franco-Iranian film Persepolis in 2011.Chief among Karoui’s rivals is Youssef Chahed, the current prime minister. Karoui’s supporters blame him for putting their man behind bars in an effort to hobble his campaign.In his campaign offices in Tunis, Karoui’s team believe the moves against him may have benefited their candidate, not least the constant attacks on him on social media which have kept his name in the public eye.“Before his arrest all the indications were that he was 10 points ahead, so we are confident,” said a spokesman, Abdelaziz Belkhodja, adding that they had managed the campaign without the presence of their candidate and with all of his accounts frozen.“He started his hunger strike for several reasons, above all because he wants the right to vote and his civil rights recognised.”The presidential vote was due to take place later in the autumn following parliamentary elections, but was abruptly brought forward after the death of the incumbent, Béji Caïd Essebsi, in August.Observers suggest the campaign is so close between the frontrunners that a fraction of a percentage point could decide who goes through to the runoff.Although the role of president is supposed to be less important than the parliament and prime minister, Essebsi tried to accrue more power and status, presenting himself as a modern incarnation of the country’s founding father, Habib Bourguiba, down to wearing the same style of glasses.Tunisia’s economy, not least its key tourism sector, has struggled since terrorist attacks in 2015 on two tourist sites, the resort of Sousse and the Bardo museum, in which 60 people were killed.Tunisia’s electoral body has declared that Karoui is entitled to run, but it is unclear is what would happen if he won the runoff for president, which would pose constitutional questions if he was still in jail.Commenting on the importance of the current round of elections, Djordje Todorovic, a spokesperson for a joint election observation mission by the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said that this time round Tunisians were more focused on day-to-day issues.“The elections in 2011 were to punish the old regime and celebrate freedom. In 2015 it was an issue of identity – who was Islamist and who was not. Now the question voters are asking of politicians is: ‘What are you going to do for me?’ with the economy a priority.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Byrne claims cannabis possession in Ireland derailed efforts to secure legal status in USMeeting seen as unlikely to produce substantive movement on BrexitTwo of Kerry\u0026rsquos top stars, Stephen O\u0026rsquoBrien and Se\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoShea, play with Kenmare ShamrocksOff-duty police officer spotted explosive device under car, court toldGalway TD claimed direct provision centre would \u0026lsquodestroy the fabric of Oughterard\u0026rsquoApplication opposed by Revenue Commissioners, which is a creditor of the companyWaiting lists up 53,000 since start of 2019, NTPF figures revealDog wounded, man (20s) hit in leg by ricocheting bullet during incident in LongfordProcessing plant in North approved to supply retailers with Republic reared meatSister of Olivia Dunlea criticises prison service for allowing killer Darren Murphy out on compassionate groundsTeenager followed concert-goer onto bus and took his phone , court heardNorthern Ireland cases cannot leapfrog straight to the supreme courtC\u0026ampD Pet Foods said it mainly uses pork and chicken but it has been \u0026lsquotactically targeted\u0026rsquoGarda accused of \u0026lsquocorruptly obtaining\u0026rsquo payment for revealing confidential informationBoy (16) had \u0026lsquoengaged in unpredictable aggressive and violent behaviour in the school\u0026rsquoNewly nominated EU trade commissioner raised possibility at event in Dublin\u0026rsquos RDSNigel Evans alleges that Ireland will also face shortages in the event of a no-deal BrexitFive-in-a-row, three-in-a-row, treble-double and double at stake in bumper GAA weekend"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017102.1568377088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar says gap between eu and uk on deal very wide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar pictured at the Fine Gael pre-Dáil parliamentary party think-in at Garryvoe in east Cork on Friday. Photograph:  ProvisionThe gap between Britain and the European Union over Brexit remains “very wide,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday.His comments come as British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to make a renewed push to reach an exit deal with the European Union. Mr Johnson will hold his first meeting with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday but signs of a breakthrough remained distant with the DUP pouring cold water on suggestions the contentious Irish border “backstop” could be reworked.An article in Friday’s Times newspaper said the DUP had agreed to shift its red lines on Brexit, saying it could accept Northern Ireland abiding by some EU rules post-Brexit as part of a new deal to replace the Irish backstop. The paper claimed the DUP had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, something it had previously said was unacceptable since it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the rest of the UK.Democratic Unionist Party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson rejected the report as nonsense. “We will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop... It won’t be a backstop by any other name either. We will not be accepting separate arrangements that cut us off from UK”. He suggested the Northern Ireland assembly would require an effective veto of any EU regulations, only approving measures “if we believe it is to the advantage of industry in Northern Ireland,” something the EU and Ireland have repeatedly rejected. DUP leader Arlene Foster also rejected the suggestion in a tweet, saying the “UK must leave as one nation”.“We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK,” Foster said. With Mr Johnson vowing to take Britain out of the EU on October 31st with or without a deal, the EU has focused in recent days on whether the main disagreement - over plans to guarantee the border in Ireland remains open - can be bridged. A deal reached last year with Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May would guarantee regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland to help keep goods flowing. But the British parliament rejected this three times. Mr Johnson says the border backstop must be replaced to reach any Withdrawal deal. The EU says any replacement must have the same effect as the backstop, and so far London has offered no proposals that are considered sufficient. “The gap is very wide,” he said. Mr Johnson’s office said he would hold talks with Mr Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday as he continued his efforts to reach an agreement to smooth Britain’s EU departure. Incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan on Friday said he saw “some cause for optimism” about a breakthrough in negotiations, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.But Northern Ireland’s largest political party, whose 10 members of parliament support Johnson’s minority government, suggested a deal was not close, saying it would not let the British region be forced to accept EU regulations after Brexit.Mr Johnson’s government lost its working majority in parliament last week after expulsions and defections from his Conservatives, which means the DUP no longer holds the balance of power in parliament. But its votes could still prove crucial as Johnson tries to convince Brussels that he can secure parliamentary approval for any deal. Also on Friday, incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said the EU would probably grant an extension to the UK, should one be requested. “I think that if they ask it in the context of an election, then the 27 other members will grant that extension, but of course we have a bit to go yet because there is a possibility yet that Mr Johnson may wish to engage with the European Union and come forward with proposals to break this impasse.” Mr Hogan also said “deadlines usually concentrate the mind and on all previous occasions there was always movement close to deadlines” and said he expected this to happen again. - Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

If there are shortages in the UK, there’ll be shortages in Ireland.”The remarks were condemned on social media as suggesting that Britain would punish Ireland by withholding medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.They were also compared to comment made by his fellow Tory MP and now home secretary Priti Patel back in December last year in response to suggestion that a no-deal Brexit could lead to food shortages in Ireland.“This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during negotiations?” she told the Times in reference to the report.Supply modelThe Department of Health has said Ireland has a different supply model for medicines to that which operates in the UK.The Department stressed it was confident there will be sufficient stocks to deal with all contingencies and that steps have been taken to ensure that there is not an immediate impact on the supply of medicines.The Department states that there are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the medicine supply chain.It added: “The pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided assurance that they are confident they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur.“There is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.”Even in the event of some pharmaceutical companies pulling out of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, supplies can be replaced.“Any products that may be affected would be unlikely to be critical to continuity of care as there are and will be alternative suppliers or therapeutic alternatives available,” the department maintains.“Medicine shortages are a feature of modern health systems, but Ireland has a multi-stakeholder system in place to prevent and manage shortages when they occur.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe .Galway West TD Noel Grealish has faced criticism from politicians and on social media for allegedly portraying African asylum seekers as economic migrants who “sponge off the system”. The comments were ascribed to him after a public meeting in Oughterard, Co Galway on Wednesday night. The meeting was called over speculation that a direct provision centre may be located in a disused hotel close to the town. The Independent TD reportedly told the meeting, attended by 800 people, that the only group in Africa in need of asylum were Christians being persecuted by Islamic State. He said most Africans arriving into Ireland were sponging off the system. He received a loud round of applause after concluding his speech. Some other people who spoke at the meeting referred to asylum seekers as “those people” and, according to a number of those who attended, other offensive remarks were made. Mr Grealish did not respond to numerous calls and texts from The . His fellow Galway West TD Catherine Connolly also spoke at the meeting and publicly told Mr Grealish she was unhappy at his remarks. “He was not the only person who said that. A phrase was used more than once, ‘those people’, which I was unhappy with. I was heckled once or twice. I asked them to consider my points and they did listen,” she said. Ms Connolly there was a lot of anger which she understood. She said the Department of Justice, by refusing to give any information about its plans, had allowed a vacuum of information to develop. “The vacuum is terrible. It allows for rumours and information that is not factual, that’s what I heard in Oughterard on Wednesday night, including from a politician,” she said. HeckledSeán Kyne, the Government chief whip who is from the area, was heckled and booed by some sections of the crowd. Mr Kyne told the meeting there was a tender process ongoing in the west to find locations for new asylum centres but that this was under the remit of the Department of Justice and neither he nor his colleagues were privy to information about any applications.Joe Loughnane, from the Galway Anti-racism Network, called on Mr Grealish to resign over the comments. “I have never heard a TD saying something like that in my life,” he said. He said that while there was an angry atmosphere at the meeting, nobody had made remarks like those of Mr Grealish.Local councillor Tom Welby, who chaired the meeting, said he could not comment on Mr Grealish’s comments. “I cannot say with certainty what he said word for word. There were minutes taken of the meeting but they are not ready yet. Until they are, I am not going to comment on what he might have said,” he said. The councillor said the meeting was called because of intensive construction work being done on the Connemara Gateway Hotel, which has been closed for more than a decade. He said locals had put two and two together and suspected a direct provision centre was to be located there. ‘No problem’Asked were there racist overtones to the meeting, he replied: “I reject the accusation. I have no problem with integrating. We have all nationalities in Oughterard as it is. Our problem is this is a flawed process.”It is understand the Department of Justice holds the view it can make no comment about any possible location for a centre on the grounds that tender evaluation process is underway. That includes not being in a position to confirm if the owners of a particular property has applied. Sources said that once contracts are awarded, then a full communications campaign is put in place, which informs local communities about the decision. However, all the local politicians said this approach created a vacuum and generated fears. “There is no dialogue with the community,” said Mr Welby. “By the time the contract is signed it will be a done deal. There’s will be no point at that stage in consultation.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe The United Kingdom may have a new prime minister in several weeks who may decide not to exit the European Union, newly nominated EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has said.Speaking to an audience at the RDS in Dublin, Mr Hogan said that the actions of some members of the Conservative Party to block a no-deal departure had improved the likelihood of a further extension to the Brexit deadline beyond October 31st and a general election in November.This has concentrated the mind of the British prime minister Boris Johnson and left him in a “vulnerable position” without a parliamentary majority, he said.He believed Mr Johnson would make “every possible effort to do a deal” between now and the resumption of the UK parliament on October 14th. He thought that the prime minister wanted a deal “but not everyone around him wants a deal,” said Mr Hogan in a thinly veiled reference to the prime minister’s aide Dominic Cummings. In response to a question about Remainers not voting for the proposed Brexit deal, Mr Hogan raised the possibility that the UK may not ultimately exit the EU given that the upcoming election could lead to a new government with a different mandate from the British people.“You are presupposing that the United Kingdom are going out of the European Union. They may not. Mr Johnson has a big responsibility in the next four weeks. It could fall to somebody else on the fifth week and you could have a second referendum and this will be dependent on the mandate that whatever new government the UK will get in November,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In one of the videos, posted by Gearóid Murphy, Mr Grealish can be heard addressing the crowd.He said: “Now I have worked with one or two Syrian families. These were genuine refugees who were persecuted in their homeland, because they were Christian, by Isis. They were housed around Galway, put in houses, they were accepted by communities.“If you watch the news, and even our Taoiseach said two weeks ago that he would take an extra 200 what-do-you-call migrants from Africa.“These are economic migrants.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too.

It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThough the exoplanet was first spotted in 2015, new research has finally allowed scientists to reveal the existence of water.\u0026nbspCurrent equipment is only able to determine basic factors such as distance, mass and temperature but sophisticated tools developed at University College London helped\u0026nbsptranslate existing data from the Hubble Space Telescope to make sense of the unique molecule signatures of water vapour.K2-18b is classed as a super-Earth because it is bigger than our Earth – twice as big, as well as eight times heavier.K2-18b super-Earth (M\u0026nbspKornmesserESAHubbleAFP)K2-18b\u0026nbspis too far away for astronomers to see, but they can look at how starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere as it passes around its own sun, called\u0026nbspK2-18.The planet is a lot closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, meaning it only takes around 33 days to transit.“It’s the only planet outside our solar system that we know has the correct temperature, an atmosphere and water,” said lead\u0026nbspauthor Dr\u0026nbspAngelos\u0026nbspTsiaras.“Of course,\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis not a second Earth, because it is a planet that is much bigger, has a different atmospheric composition. It’s orbiting a completely different star, so it doesn’t look like Earth.“The search for habitable planets, it’s very exciting, but it’s here to always remind us that this\u0026nbspis our only home and it’s probably out of the question if we will be able to travel to other planets.”Although the planet sits in the habitable zone, scientists say that instruments available at present are not able to determine any signs of life.Exoplanets will get real names rather than numbersMany more observations are needed\u0026nbspto be sure that it is\u0026nbsphabitable.Scientists, who have published their findings in the Nature Astronomy journal after more than a year of work, believe that the water content could be as low as 0.01 per cent\u0026nbspor as high as 50 per cent.“We don’t know how much water there is however, what these models clearly say is that there is an atmosphere and that there is water there,” said co-author Dr\u0026nbspIngo\u0026nbspWaldmann.Researchers do not think\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis the only potentially habitable\u0026nbspsuper-Earth\u0026nbspand expect to find others with similar characteristics among more than 4,000 exoplanets that have already been discovered.They hope that newer technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope due to launch in March 2021, will unlock more secrets beyond our solar system.“We are looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and going even further,” Dr\u0026nbspTsiaras\u0026nbspadded.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation.

However, the relationship between the men remains a mystery.The way in which the pair were buried represents “a voluntary expression of commitment between two iniduals” and was not a common burial practice, according to the research, which was published in the Scientific Reports journal.Created with Sketch.

So it’s not as straightforward as some people are suggesting,” Mr Coveney said.He added that the lack of worked out policy suggestions from the UK was a “a source of real frustration” on his side of the table.EU officials say the British government has still not presented “concrete proposals” for a replacement to the Irish backstop in the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within the country’s overlooked hinterland, conditions are desperate, with unemployment in some areas thought to be as high as 30 per cent.Despite a much vaunted war on corruption, spearheaded by presidential candidate and current prime minister Youssef Chahed, the perception across much of the country is one of an entrenched elite getting richer, while many are left to languish in poverty.Created with Sketch.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence. Across the country, the same anger that sparked the country’s 2011 revolution continues to fester and continues to fuel Nabil Karoui’s populist campaign.Karoui\u0026nbsphas remained in detention since his arrest on 23 August, and he lost the second of two appeals for conditional release on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But he fell out of favour with Mr Erdogan in recent years, and has been sharply critical of his rule in recent months, prompting the party’s disciplinary board to consider his expulsion.In a televised appearance, the 60-year-old scholar and diplomat said he was quitting the AKP rather than forcing the trauma of a schismatic confrontation. \u0026nbspFor several years, Mr Davutoglu’s criticisms had been muted and mostly tolerated by Mr Erdogan. But an allegation he made last month suggesting government complicity in a series of 2015 terrorist attacks apparently crossed the line. The violent attacks scuttled peace talks between the Turkish state and rebellious Kurds, and appeared to bolster Mr Erdogan’s popularity ahead of general elections.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

Another founder of the AKP, former president Abdullah Gul, has been rumoured to be behind the effort but has yet to formally announce any involvement.\u0026nbspMr Davutoglu was widely seen as more moderate than Mr Erdogan, and has voiced sympathy for opposition activists and journalists caught up in the government’s years-long dragnet. But he was also the architect of the country’s Syria policy, and is blamed by both Erdogan supporters and opponents for opening Turkey’s borders to allow millions of Syrian refugees to settle in the country.\u0026nbspDavutoglu\u0026nbspannounced his resignation in a televised appearance (Haber Turk)Analysts say Mr Babacan’s prospects are better. Many Turks see him as the man behind the country’s decade-long economic boom, and see his departure from the cabinet in 2015 as the beginning of Turkey’s fiscal troubles. In an interview with the daily paper Karar this week, Mr Babacan insisted his new party would stand up for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law.\u0026nbsp“This is what Turkey strongly needs right now,” he was quoted as saying. “Freedom of thought and freedom of faith. The state itself should be the guarantor of this.”Unless there is pressure for early elections, Mr Erdogan will remain firmly in charge as president until 2023. He\u0026nbsphas dismissed the defections, predicting Mr Babacan “will go nowhere” by forming a new party, and accusing him of iding the Muslim community.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Secular, nationalist, and leftist opposition parties broke open Turkey’s constricted political space this year with victories against Mr Erdogan’s allies in mayoral elections, and some have accused the AKP dissidents of opportunistically entering the fray while doing little to resist the party’s abuses when they were in government.\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdogan shows snippets from New Zealand terrorist videos at campaign rallies“We didn’t really know about any of the disputes they had until they left,” said Onur Yerim, president of Dragoman Strategies, an Istanbul risk consultancy. “Nothing has surfaced over the years that there were major disagreements over policy. If there was, why didn’t they do anything about it when they were part of parliament or the cabinet and had seats and roles?”But analysts say the defections\u0026nbspcould nonetheless hurt Mr Erdogan, and help the opposition, potentially ending the political dominance of the AKP which began in 2002.\u0026nbsp“We are not sure whether it will lead to a big split among party members, but Davutoglu is claiming that the AK Party has lost its soul, its founding principles,” said Ilhan Uzgel, a political scientist based in Ankara. “He may not garner a lot of votes, but it may harm the image of the party, which is going in the direction of authoritarianism and corruption.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But talk about vorsprung durch technik. They are quite a distraction.According to my notes, though, Motsi’s also: “Hoping to give them a bit more encouragement. It’s a tough journey and blah blah blah.”So, aside from being hopelessly compromised by the presence of her contestant sister, Oti, it was situation normal at Strictly’s pairing ceremony, which was a bit like the NFL draft for Z-list celebrities. Nothing happened and yet everything happened.An occasion that actually asks quite a lot of the contestants, who have to feign wild enthusiasm for the announcement of their partner, no matter who they get.Levels of sincerity ied on Saturday.Dear old Anton Du Beke looked genuinely delighted to be paired with the dance-trained Emma “Honey” Barton off EastEnders and avoid the Anneka Rice bullet.While BBC pundit Alex Scott resorted to the pat footballer’s response: “I’m over the moon,” to avoid saying anything too specic about how she really felt about Neil Jones, and Giovanni Pernice wasn’t fooling anyone with his fist pumps for landing Michelle Visage .Before we even got to that stage, though, viewers had the almost as tricky task of identying this year’s celebrities, who came with some pretty desperate pleadings.“You may know me from being a CBBC presenter.” No.“You may have seen me on BBC’s Animal Park.” No.“People may have seen me cooking on Saturday morning TV.” Yeah, and they may have seen aliens doing a conga down Falkirk High Street at closing time, Viscountess Emma Weymouth, but I haven’t and I’m supposed to be doing this stuff professionally.It’s the height of arrogance, of course, for the BBC to serve up such an anonymous line-up on its biggest show and, one day, it will bite them on the backside.At the moment, though, a certain level of complacency is probably justied, because I’m pretty sure I said the same thing about Seann Walsh last year, and he turned out to be one of the most talked-about bookings in Strictly history.As unimaginative as these new bookings are, there’s also the tantalising prospect of some serious dancing stfs among that line-up, particularly from the blokes.My expectations are especially high low for Mike Bushell, Chris Ramsey, the ping-pong bloke and rower James Cracknell, who’s “got Luba” , but is already being talked about by the presenters in terms that wouldn’t have flattered Professor Stephen Hawking.“He’s used to sitting down.”All of which, you may have noticed, ignores the real elephant in the room at Saturday’s pairing ceremony, who was teed up perfectly when Mike Bushell laid out his dance credentials.“I like jumping up and down to Faithless.”Well, today’s you’re lucky day, Michael. You’re going to be jumping up and down WITH Faithless.“It’s Katya!”And may that be a lesson you’ll never forget, young lady.Celebs On The Farm, Caprice: “We need to encourage Arg.”Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Mickey , it’s great to see you in such great shape.”And please send flowers and tributesPiers ever thinks Mickey looks “a bit off colour”.HAVING almost run out of people to offend, patronise and revolt in Los Angeles, it was time for Gemma Collins to choose a fragrance for her new brand of perfume on last week’s final episode of ITVBe’s Diva Forever.Something to reflect her “personality” was the instruction.But with Novichok now on the proscribed list, it looked like being a long old haul as she road- tested a few of the alternatives supplied by her visibly horried US agent.“Nah, car air ­freshener,” said Gemma, pulling a face at the first one.“And this one’s got something that makes me feel sick.”“They don’t know who I am,” she bellowed. “You have to explain who I am. The GC.”Ladies and gentlemen of the US press, meet Godzilla’s Cousin.Fair.THOSE eye-watering meatballs Neil “Razor” Ruddock served up for London Zoo staff last week have already passed into Celebrity MasterChef legend, but probably not out of the systems of anyone who ate them.The size and consistency of hand grenades, they were. And one of the keepers should probably have checked the elephant house, just to seethe bulls were missing anything.They were definitely the culinary highlight of the week though, on a show that always stands or falls on the quality of the bookings.Last week it stood thanks to Razor, Joey Essex and dear old Zandra Rhodes, , who now occupies the same DNA space as a Barry Humphries impression of Su Pollard.A lot of the camera’s attention, of course, was focused on Joey, who was funny here in a way he’s really not on a lot of other shows, probably because so much of his food was “dense”, “thick” and “simple”.The real danger to le and limb, however, was Zandra, who’s deaf as an egg whisk and absolutely lethal with a ft-long kebab skewer in her hands, which may or may not have explained a slight edge to the commentary.“On the red team, Zandra and Oti are preparing the trout for the smoker.”A bit harsh. Plenty of le left in the old girl.Keisha: “John Major.”Ben Shephard: “What relation to you is the daughter of your aunt ”Martin: “Sister.”Lucky Stars, Ben Shephard: “Which cereal grain is the main ingredient in sushi ”Kimberly Wyatt: “Seaweed.”And The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In AD a man is said to have been attacked by what Scottish monster ”Rosie: “Giants.”No. Kenny Burns.DEAR old Auntie actually sounding proud of the fact, “Gemma Collins is now at the BBC”.Anyone who thinks  years of politicians shouting “let me just finish” on Question Time is a cause for celebration.Good Morning Britain’s human anaconda, Piers Morgan, almost dislocating his jaw at the thought of swallowing British Airways’ eight-course tasting menu.Britain’s Got Talent’s Wembley Arena audience voting for the best sob storyinstead of the best act .And Brazilian kne thrower Alfredo Silva announcing he’d split from we Anna, then ruining everything by revealing he’d dropped her from the act as well. Just as things might have got interesting. TREASURE Island’s cash-snaffling bounder Lord I Mountbatten already looking like the most inspired reality show booking of the year.Russell Crowe’s stunning transformation on Sky Atlantic’s brilliant The Loudest Voice. Lost Voice Guy’s drooling emoji getting a genuine belly laugh, rather than the sympathetic iety that normally greets Britain’s Got Talent comedians.And the final episode of Mortimer  Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, where the overwhelming sense of peace, calm and friendship is only enhanced by the knowledge the BBC’s best show ticks none of its precious and idiotic boxes.SHANE Warne: “As a commentator I was told two things. One, don’t tell me what I can see. And three, take me out to the middle.”Matt Murray: “It looked a really bad injury when Bloomfield was stretchered on.”Lewis Hamilton: “At Mercedes you’re in the family for le. So long as you stay with them.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He annoyed people because he was clever, pompous and headstrong.”That description could be given today by many MPs, who have tired of Bercow’s constant attention-seeking and his delight in the sound of his own hammy voice.Just as aggravating has been his bias towards the anti-Conservative opposition. That was reflected yesterday in the Commons at news of his imminent resignation.In a nauseating display, Labour MPs who queued up to heap praise on him before they gave him a standing ovation.The Speaker should be a neutral referee who allows the game to flow freely and fairly.But, throughout his  years in charge of the chamber, Bercow was a whistle-happy, partisan official who acted as an additional player for his favoured side and continually put himself at the centre of the action.To understand Bercow, one incident is particularly illuminating. An early turning point in Bercow’s young le came when the head of his primary school refused to put him forward to grammar school, despite Bercow being so precocious he already read The Times .Instead he had to go to the local comprehensive, where he was bullied.On one occasion he was thrown in a pond as his chief tormentor said triumphantly, “Bercow is in there with the other amphibians.”But the experience fed Bercow’s determination to achieve, which he channelled into politics.To his army of left-wing supporters, he was a great reformer who modernised the practices of the Commons, expanded the role of backbenchers and held the Government rigorously to account.But to his enemies, he was squawking egomaniac who demeaned his office with his behaviour. His explicit cheerleading for left-wing causes and Remain was bad enough.This is a figure who subverted the rules of Parliament to wreck Brexit and undermine the Tory Government through endless procedural manoeuvres, as he has shown again this month.The notorious “B******s to Brexit” sticker on his family car, parked at Parliament, has reflected his attitude.His enthusiasm for the fashionable cause of ersity was highlighted in March  when, at a Westminster ceremony, he bizarrely described Elizabeth II as “a kaleidoscope Queen in a kaleidoscope country in a kaleidoscope Commonwealth.”In another typical move, he barred President Trump from addressing Parliament during his recent state visit, justying his stance on the grounds of Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism.”Nor has he been helped by his eccentric conduct of his we Sally, who is almost as big an attention-seeker as he is.She worked in public relations and was a Labour campaigner when they married in , but it was his elevation to the Speaker’s chair in  that really gave her the opportunity to bask in the limelight.Having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother – and been the first contestant in her series to be evicted – she went on to take part in an reality show with Paddy Doherty, the CBB winner, bare-knuckle fighter and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star, with the pair taking it in turns to experience the other’s lestyle.She caused more embarrassment with other incidents, like the infamous stunt in  when she was photographed in the shadow of Big Ben wearing just a strategically placed sheet.After that, Bercow reportedly “read her the riot act.”Yet she caused him further humiliation when it was revealed in March  that she had indulged in a long, passionate affair with the Speaker’s cousin, Alan Bercow.Though she rebuilt her marriage, she admitted that she was “a terrible we and always had been.”Perhaps the darkest episode of all was when used social media to hint that the former Tory Treasurer Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, a baseless smear for which she ended up in court in , was convicted of libel and ordered to pay undisclosed damages. Despite his legal victory, Lord McAlpine died soon afterwards.Before his marriage to Sally, Bercow had few serious relationships.Conceited and awkward with women, he was described in his youth by one female contemporary as a “loudmouthed” and “not attractive young man.”A female journalist who went on a few dates with him recalled that he “was a very odd little man and socially quite gauche. He was restless and found it hard to relax.”His insecurities were fed by his stature and also his unusual background, which gave him the sense of being an outsider.Further friction is generated by Bercow’s manner, which combines self-importance with linguistic showing-off and flashes of rudeness.Part of this stems from small man syndrome.Standing just  feet six inches tall, Bercow tries to make up for his lack of stature by parading his authority.The former Tory Minister Sir Simon Burns memorably described Bercow as “a sanctimonious dwarf.”Several Tories were so exasperated with him that in  that they tried to throw him out of his job.The MP James Durridge, who organised this unsuccessful bid, said that Labour find Bercow “convenient because he is a more effective opposition than their own leader.”But since then Bercow’s pro-Remain antics have stretched Conservative tolerance beyond breaking point.That’s why the party decided to take the unprecedented step of standing a candidate against Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next election in defiance of the long-standing tradition that the Speaker is never opposed by any of the main parties.There have been repeated accusations that Bercow has bullied his staff, allegations he denies, just as he disputes the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman.”Whatever the truth, he has not established a harmonious atmosphere at Westminster or enhanced his reputation.Unlike some of his predecessors like Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd, he leaves office under a cloud.Bercow was brilliant at tennis, even becoming a junior British champion. As a young player, he was described by a professional as “unbelievably talented and invincible.”To this day Bercow retains his deep enthusiasm for the sport and is a big fan of Roger Federer - particularlyhe can watch him for free.An investigation last year found he had received more than £, in freebies since he became speaker - most of which were tickets to tennis and football matches.Indeed, he was spotted at Wimbledon this year wearing a t-shirt with the Federer logo on it, while he was also caught by a BBC camera saying, “We all love you, Roger, all of us.”Im not sure the same can be said of Bercow.After a decade in the role of Speaker, he leaves behind a tainted legacy.He sees himself as a champion of Parliamentary democracy. But in reality, he has presided over a woefully discredited Commons.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too.

Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop.

But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us.

And you can bet some sort of coalition deal will be struck between Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.This would result in a rejection of any deal.

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We tried and we failed to launch a non-fried product.“We were unable to sustain sales. They were just not selling.“It’s no good launching a product which looks good nutritionally but then nobody buys.“It doesn’t improve the health of the nation and in terms of sustainability it is a disaster.”Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said she was not surprised by KFC’s struggles to introduce “non-fried” products.But insisted reformulating everyday foods to make them healthier can still be done successfully.KFC said it has also had mixed success with its new skin-on fries.The thicker cut chips have  per cent fewer calories and  per cent less fat.Ms Packwood added: “Frankly it has been controversial and we get a lot of grief about our fries.”But she said customers have embraced their lower-calorie rice box, as it still contains its trademark fried chicken.She said: “It’s giving people a little bit of what they love but wrapping it in something healthier.”Other big brands also revealed their struggles with reformulation.Tesco group quality director Sarah Bradbury said sales of its own-brand tomato soup plummeted when they instantly reduced salt levels by a quarter.She said: “Overnight they stopped buying our soup.

agreed to a move that could pave the way for a Brexit deal.The Times reported the party accepted some changes that would see Northern Ireland sticking to some European Union rules post-Brexit.But it would be a new deal to replace the hard Irish backstop, a sticking point for many in the Brexit negotiations.The paper claimed the DUP, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.A point it had previously said was unacceptable as it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland.It was claimed that inBrussels would let go of its insistence Northern Ireland stays in a customs union with the EU.Leader Arlene Foster tweeted the party would be keen to see a sensible deal but added not one that ides the internal market of the UK.She was adamant: We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.The source told The Times the move had been described as signicant, but urged a deal was a long way off.This proposal is said to have been talked over on Monday when Mr Johnson had a meeting with Leo Varadkar, the Irish Prime Minister.Earlier this week we told how Mr Johnson ruled out a Northern Ireland only backstop after an Irish EU chief said chances of a Brexit deal are rising.The backstop, the most controversial element of Theresa May’s deal, has been a constant stumbling block in Brexit negotiations.But the PM was handed a boost this week when Phil Hogan, a nominee for EU trade commissioner,  said the “penny had dropped” after he suggested an “all-Ireland” farming market after our orce from the bloc.He later told RTE: I also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position…where hes now prepared to look at ergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom.So I think theres movement happening on both sides.Under the plan, Northern Ireland would match Irish and EU rules in certain sectors after Brexit to avoid the need for a hard border.The idea mimics a compromise offer The Sun revealed European capitals were brainstorming - where the province would mirror Brussels on animal and plant health.The PM’s comments came after he had crunch Brexit talks with DUP boss Arlene Foster and the party’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds in No on Tuesday.Foster said they had a “very good meeting” and the government would not back the idea of a northern Irish backstop because it would not have “unionist consent”.Mr Johnson was also warned against breaking the law over Brexit by Speaker John Bercow, who vowed creativity in Parliament would scupper a no-deal exit.The warning came as the EUs chief negotiator said there is no reason to be optimistic that a new agreement can be brokered before the Prime Ministers deadline to ask for a delay.Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European Parliament on Thursday he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK Government would result in a deal by mid-October.The PM is legally bound to ask Brussels for an extension to Article he cannot get MPs to back a deal by October , after Parliament approved legislation designed to prevent a no deal.And this week Scotlands highest civil court ruled on Wednesday that the prorogation was unlawful because it was obtained for the improper purpose of stymying Parliament.Mr Johnson said the High Court in England had taken the opposite view to the Court of Session in Edinburgh and that the case would now be decided in the Supreme Court.He also insisted he was very hopeful that he could secure a deal by the EU summit starting on October ."},{"url":null,"title":"colourised pictures victorian london charles dicken","story":"The expertly colourised snaps

collaborated with journalist Adolphe Smith to document the lives of London’s urban poor.”“Their project, Street Le in London, was released in monthly instalments and later as a single volume.“Thomson and Smith combined un-posed, documentary images of street vendors, beggars and other workers with interviews, essays and reportage, which explored poverty as a sociological problem to be studied and alleviated.“I have produced colourised versions of  photographs that appeared in Street Le in London.“Hopefully these colourised images help to bring the London of the s a little closer.”Acclaimed photographer Thomson, who would go onto achieve a royal warrant for his work, and radical journalist Adolphe Smith, took on the fairly unheard-of task of introducing the middle and upper classes to the plight of the workers.In their book, Smith and Thomson write: “We have sought to portray these harder phases of le, bringing to bear the precision of photography in illustration of our subjects.“The unquestionable accuracy of this testimony will enable us to present true types of the London poor and shield us from the accusation of either underrating or exaggerating inidual peculiarities of appearance.”Although often dismissive of the conditions of the poor, Smith did attempt to lend a sympathetic ear to the people he portrayed.According to the London School of Economics Street Le in London, one of the very first books to include “true to le” images is now regarded as a key work in the history of documentary photography."},{"url":null,"title":"health alert hepatitis c

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email When Nicola Owst found a Staffordshire bull terrier abandoned and close to death she didn’t think twice about saving him. But what she didn’t know then was that her new buddy would save her too – by freeing her from her past. The brave dog would also go on to become a social media star and capture the hearts of dog lovers everywhere. Here, in an extract from her new book, Saving Buddy, Nicola shares their story of survival, hope and love.His poor sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face and just trying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. The skin around his filthy, swollen muzzle was pockmarked and livid pink where his fur had worn away. Blood under his right eye had soaked down his face and neck and on to his body, and his skeletal bird-like legs showed every sinew.  He was barely alive and every movement was agonising for him. It was April  and I’d travelled from Leicestershire with my stable-owner friend, Sally, and her daughter, Charlie, to collect two unwanted foals from a couple of shady-looking men in a junkyard just outside London. We’d just finished loading the horse-box when Charlie spotted a dog wedged into a cat carrier, inside a rusty crate. He was barely breathing – clinging on to le. So I freed the cat box and carefully lted him out of his prison. He was some kind of staffy and his terribly scared face showed he’d endured the most dreadful mistreatment. Had he been in illegal dog fights  He’d been left to die in his own waste. The stench of rotting flesh and faeces was unbelievable. His paw pads were red raw from standing in his own urine. What sort of monster could leave an animal is such a state  When I lted his limp body on to my lap, his legs buckled beneath him. I gently swaddled him in a towel. “I’ve got you now, buddy,” I whispered to him. And from that moment on he was known as Buddy.  We set off home but I feared he might not survive the journey and kept saying “Hang in there, Buddy.” We drove straight to the vet who took one look at Buddy and shook his head. It was the worst case of neglect he’d ever seen. Buddy was riddled with demodectic mange. The infection had eaten his skin and his weakened immune system meant he couldn’t fight it. The next  hours would be critical. Armed with antibiotics and a treatment for his skin, we went home. I half-filled the kitchen sink with water, added anti-bacterial shampoo and lowered Buddy in. I gently bathed away the foul dirt and grime as he sat there, placidly. Bit by bit, his lovely, splodgy brown and black brindle markings became clearer, and the real Buddy started to be revealed. This was possibly the first tender care he’d ever been given. I talked to him the whole time, telling him what a brave boy he was. It broke my heart to think about how scared he must have been, abandoned in that crate to die. Once he was clean, I wrapped him up in a big fluffy towel and patted him dry. I then cooked him some mini-fillets of chicken and a sachet of rice. I knewhe ate something, he would stand a better chance of making it through the night. Next morning Buddy seemed perkier. He tried to stand and walk towards me like a wobbly Bambi, but his back legs were too weak and his paws were agony. I went to Asda and bought some baby socks, padded the soles with cotton wool to cushion his paw pads and kept them on with sticky tape. The next time he wobbled on to his feet, he stayed upright for a few more seconds. It was a step in the right direction. And I did some research on Staffordshire bull terriers and was reassured to read they’re a lot softer than their fearsome reputation suggests.    I was going through a break-up at the time and, looking back, it feels asBuddy was sent to give me new focus. I needed help too. I felt very raw and vulnerable, unwanted and rejected. The moment Buddy looked at me with those pleading eyes, I knew he wanted me as much as I wanted him. By healing him, I was healing myself of heartache. I rescued Buddy that day but he also rescued me. Day by day he grew stronger and started to put on weight, but it was a long process. The raw, pink boy I’d rescued started to sport a summer coat. As I massaged his velvet-soft ears, he’d close his eyes in pleasure and wag his tail. I didn’t feel alone as I was so unconditionally loved by my little ball of energy. I had spent so long with loser boyfriends and shed too many tears when relationships had failed. But now I had a fantastic companion who’d be there for me through thick and thin. I was a manager at a job centre and in July  we got some new recruits. We were a similar age and got on well and would all go out for a drink. One of them, Jon Owst, was really nice and I enjoyed chatting to him. He was tall with dark hair, lovely blue eyes and a kind way – eager to hear all about my twin passions: Buddy and horses. We became friends and, six months later, Jon asked me on a date. It was lovely, but I’d gone on about Buddy so much Jon could be in no doubt it was a case of love me, love my dog. To my surprise he asked me out again and we took Buddy to the park. It was a fantastic day – the start of something special. Jon was a breath of fresh air and quickly became a new dad to Buddy. It made me realise how self-centred my recent ex-boyfriend had been. Buddy made me realise le is too short to be with someone who only cared about themselves. In August  Jon popped the question and presented me with a beautul ring. I said yes, straight away. We got married on Easter Sunday, . Our wedding was perfect. Buddy had a gorgeous garland of flowers in the coral wedding colours and he starred in many of the wedding photos.    But two years later I was cuddling Buddy and noticed a hard swelling on his back left ankle – the size of a large broad bean. The vet didn’t think it looked sinister. But I had a niggling feeling it was serious and Jon insisted I take Buddy back to the vet. He sent Buddy for an X-ray and “to have some cells tested.” I went into panic, worrying Buddy had cancer. Five days after the tests the vet rang. And the only word I heard was “tumour”. I couldn’t bear it, not after everything we’d been through, after his terrible start in le. Jon hugged me and tried to put my mind at rest. We went to the surgery. The vet said the tumour was in an awkward place and Buddy needed an specialist. Whatthe cancer had spread into Buddy’s leg. Would it mean amputation to save his le  The op went well. But the surgeon wasn’t % certain he’d removed all of the tumour. Buddy had to have radiotherapy and eight doses of chemotherapy. But how were we going to pay for it  I’d got pet insurance after rescuing Buddy, but with cancer costs rocket and there was very little in the pot.   I was desperately worried. We hadn’t been in our new house long and had no savings. But I’d created a Facebook page called Buddy Dog – The Rescue Staffy, to spread the word that staffies are lovely dogs.I posted about his treatment and the more I shared, the more Buddy’s friends increased.Friends suggested I set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds towards the treatment. And, amazingly, within weeks, we had raised the £ needed. When Buddy had his final round of chemo it was such a relief. It looked as though he would again be the incredible personality we knew and loved. But during Buddy’s cancer scare, we found out I was expecting. I had terrible morning sickness and Buddy knew there was something wrong with me. He’d sit next to me with his head tilted, a worried frown on his face. And I told him everything – as I always had. But eight weeks into the pregnancy, I woke up and sensed something was wrong. I turned to Jon and said: “I think the baby’s gone.” A scan confirmed it two days later, I had an operation to have the pregnancy removed. I was terribly upset but knew it wasn’t uncommon. A few months later I was pregnant for a second time – but miscarried again early on. When it happened a third time I was utterly devastated. Surely there must be something wrong with me  But the gt of morning sickness was delivered again, in the autumn of .

The strategy that plunged the Tories and the nation deep into chaos in the past fortnight is masterminded by his special adviser Dominic Cummings – an admirer of the Bolsheviks’ methods. In his controversial career, the spin doctor who helped Leave win the  referendum has been referred to as a “career psychopath” and “unelected foul-mouthed oaf”. More recently, he was dubbed the Prime Minister’s “Rasputin”. And yesterday, the man who gave Cummings his first job – in Russia – said he was obsessed with the Bolsheviks’ “ruthless seizure of power” in . Adam Dixon also recalled mocking Cummings, likening him to a “well-oiled ­football-hooligan with an Oxford first”. Cummings, , is believed to have been behind the move to prorogue Parliament, which a Scottish court has now ruled unlawful.    And he helped escalate the party’s civil war, under which  MPs were expelled in a Soviet-style purge. But with him now resisting a Parliamentary probe into his emails and texts, Mr Johnson may regret taking him on. And Mr Dixon most certainly does. Cummings graduated from Oxford in  with a first in history after falling under the spell of notorious right-wing academic Norman Stone. Mr Dixon also studied Russian history at Oxford but first met Cummings in Moscow in , in a period of rampant corruption after the Soviet Union collapsed. The US entrepreneur had ambitious plans to expand regional operator Samara Airlines, which was believed to have been targeted by organised crime figures. Speaking from Connecticut, Mr Dixon said: “For anyone who didn’t experience the anarchy of Russia in the s, it is hard to imagine. “There was a deep fear the country would descend into civil war or disintegrate.  Although he did not speak much Russian, Dominic was fascinated by the anarchy and the potential for catastrophe, and willing to work in these sometimes dangerous circumstances.” He offered Cummings, then , a job on his small team in Vienna, commuting weekly to the Russian city of Samara. Mr Dixon said he was struck by “Dominic’s enthusiasm for the daring and resolve of the Bolsheviks’ ruthless seizure of power through well-applied force and extremely effective propaganda”. He said: “Although Dominic was engaging, amusing, sometimes erudite, always opinionated, he also had a broad streak of pointless pugnacity and ­belligerence. He was constantly spoiling for a fight. Although razzing him when out for a drink about being a ‘well-oiled football hooligan with an Oxford first’ was a laugh, it never had any noticeable positive effect.” Last week, a dishevelled Cummings was spotted wandering around Parliament with a glass of wine –  years after he was said to have been reprimanded for walking through Samara airport swigging a bottle of vodka.  Mr Dixon said while he would make the “football hooligan” jibes, he never saw any violence. Describing how he came to see him as a “liability”, he said: “I gave him responsibilities he quickly led me to regret. He leveraged the fact we now ‘needed him’ to sometimes behave as he liked. Left to himself, he would dress out of his laundry bag. “He was usually unshaven and often looked hung-over, unwashed. On the other hand, he was courageous, ­clear-thinking and could hold his drink, which on occasions was more of an asset than it should have been.” Cummings was sent to Singapore in  to learn a new booking system – but only scraped through the test as he missed so many of the lessons. The new skills made him a key figure but he jumped ship barely a year later. Mr Dixon said: “Although he did not leave us completely in the lurch, he did go too abruptly. I made it plain he should not think of me as a good reference. I never heard from him again. “A few years later, I read he had ‘started a Russian airline with a friend’, a distortion that was annoying.” The airline flopped a year after Cummings quit, when Russia’s rouble currency collapsed. Cummings grew up in Durham and went to £,-a-year Durham School and is married to Mary Wakefield, a senior editor at The Spectator and daughter of baronet Sir Humphrey Wakefield. Yet he likes to play the northern outsider, last week telling reporters outside his £.million townhouse: “Get out of London. Talk to people who are not rich Remainers.”  And in his s, Cummings boasted of working at Klute, his uncle’s club in Durham – which GQ named Europe’s second-worst. A former colleague said: “He would help manage the place but also stationed himself outside. He might not have looked like a doorman but he had a way that suggested it wasn’t worth taking him on.” Cummings moved into politics as campaign director for Business for Sterling – which helped keep Britain from joining the euro. He became chief of staff to former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, then a special adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove. His first major triumph was the  referendum, where he was credited with inventing the slogan “Take back control”. David Cameron labelled Cummings a “career psychopath” and veteran Tory Sir Roger Gale branded him an “unelected foul-mouthed oaf”. But Cummings, thought to earn around £,, does “not give a damn” how others see him and thinks his role is to “deliver Brexit, then f*** off”, one former Tory staffer has said. Downing Street did not comment. ADAM DIXON on the Dominic Cummings he knew: I met Dominic Cummings in the s, when I was working with a Russian partner to develop a regional airline Samara Airlines into an international carrier - in order to link the city of Samaradirectly to Europe.For anyone who didn’t experience the total anarchy and fast-moving chaos of Russia in the ‘s, it is hard to imagine now what it was like then - there was a deep fear that the country would descend into civil war or simply disintegrate, and it was a constant theme of conversation how, when, and by whom order would be restored.Although he did not speak much Russian, Dominic was fascinated by the anarchy and the potential for catastrophe, and willing to work in these bizarre and sometimes dangerous circumstances. Dominic had read History at Oxford, taking a First Class degree, and had studied with the well-known Professor Norman Stone. A gted linguist and mesmerising speaker, the right-wing Stone was almost as prodigious a drinker as he was a scholar, and often held his tutorials in a pub.  He could veer from the appalling to the hilarious and back even in the same sentence and I remember discussing with Dominic the near-scurrilous obituary that Stone had written for E.H. Carr, a great but aposleftistapos historian of the Russian Revolution, which included such remarks as aposnot even Carr’s parents liked himapos, and that Carr was best known at school for his acne. In aposWhat is History aposCarr asks,  aposIs history a thin hard core of facts surrounded by a soft pulpy mass of interpretation, or a thin hard core of interpretation surrounded by a large fleshy body of facts aposWith his close study of the Russian Revolution, and his enthusiasm for the “daring” and “resolve” of the Bolsheviks’ ruthless seizure of power through a combination of well-applied force and extremely effective propaganda, Dominic was certainly inclined towards the latter, aposa hard core of interpretationapos.Judging by the infamous red bus, as well as some of the other aposAgitpropapos initiatives in the last years for which Dominic takes credit, an outsider might wonderhe has now evolved past any concept of aposfactapos. Dominic’s family owned a night club in Durham, Klute, and the bouncer was a friend of Dominic’s, a regional heavy-weight boxing champion who was a great success with women. Dominic admired him for the quiet, calm way that he projected a capacity for sudden and extreme violence.  Although Dominic was engaging, amusing, sometimes erudite, always opinionated, he also had a broad streak of pointless pugnacity and belligerence - he was constantly aposspoiling for a fightapos, although it was not clear about what, with whom, or to what purpose. And although razzing him when we were out for a drink about being a aposwell-oiled football-hooligan with an Oxford Firstapos was a laugh, it never had any noticeable positive effect - most people agree that the British Empire wasn’t acquired in a aposfit of absentmindednessapos but far fewer would agree with Dominic that it was built by football hooligans.

Meetings of the Privy Council - which tend to involve three members advising the Queen - are shrouded in secrecy. But fortunately for Mr Skidmore, it has been suggested there wonapost be too much small talk with the monarch.Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Lord President of the Privy Council, said there was no chat, no debate in a recent meeting where he conveyed the request to shut down Parliament.He added: The Queen says aposapprovedapos.

Coke addict Christopher Marshall, , sped off when officers tried to pull him over as he was making a delivery of helium inflated balloons at a house at am. A judge said it was one of the most terrying police chases that I have ever had the misfortune to see as he banned him from the roads for  months. During the terrying high-speed pursuit pedestrians had to jump out of the way as Marshall - who had no driving licence or insurance - raced a VW Golf at high speed for  shocking minutes around the outskirts of Manchester. He repeatedly jumped red lights and went round roundabouts the wrong way and narrowly avoided smashing into taxi.  He also jumped over roads humps at mph in a bid to escape as passengers threw items out of the windows in a bid to halt the police car behind. During the pursuit, Marshall careered down tiny residential streets at between  and ph did a U-turn in the road and topped mph as he approached a set of roadworks on the A outside Stockport. When he realised he could not outrun the police patrol he stopped the vehicle and ran off. He was arrested later after being caught by a police dog. He was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of the pursuit. Today dramatic dashcam footage was issued of the am pursuit which showed speeds of up to mph on the speedometer of the patrol car, as father of one Marshall, from Gorton, Manchester admitted dangerous driving.  He faced up to two years in jail but escaped with  months imprisonment, suspended for  months due to the fact he didnapost crash the car. He claimed the incident occurred following a series a family tragedies. The car has since been sold. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Judge Mark Savill, told Marshall: “I raise an eyebrow as to why you were out at that night but for whatever reason you were. Police decided they wanted to stop you but that resulted in what then followed. “Itaposs  minutes of one of the most terrying police chases that I have ever had the misfortune to see. One’s heart is in one’s mouth as to whether you are going to kill someone.    For those  minutes you drive in completely residential areas with no care for anybody  and through numerous red lights and on the wrong side of the road. “You caused vehicles to take evasive action and narrowly avoided hitting pedestrians scurrying across the road. Its only by a miracle you didn’t hit anyone or anything. I highly commend the driver of the police vehicle for his skill and determination in maintaining this chase after you. It was purely by good chance that you did not hit anyone and eventually you gave up and ran off.aposapos He added: aposaposYou also have some of the strongest personal mitigation that I have read for some time but it doesn’t in any way excuse your behavior that night and of driving in the way you did. You are somebody who uses cocaine although there was no use of cocaine in this offence. However had you hit someone or something I would be sending you immediately into custody.aposapos  The incident occurred on July  just hours after Marshall - who runs a bouncy castle business - had bought the VW despite having no licence or insurance. It is believed he was delivering balloons with three other friends at a house in Edgeley at .am when police asked him to stop. Prosecuting Miss Gwen Henshaw, said: “There appeared to be four men in the Golf and the car accelerated away from the police vehicle hitting speeds of up  mph in a mph residential area. He passed through a junction and a red light and continued on Wellington Road North hitting at least mph and a further red light was crossed at speeds of about mph. aposaposMr Marshall continued to drive at speed when he negotiated speed bumps at around mph and narrowly avoided a collision with two pedestrians. He also narrowly avoided a collision with a taxi after he passed through another red traffic light.

Patrick Carter, , was made to view his horrendous crimes as footage of his mobile phone videos was played at Greenock Sherf Court on Tuesday. Carter used his three dogs, a Patterdale-Jack Russell cross called Laddie, and Lurchers Max and Murphy, to inflict suffering on badgers, foxes and deer. In two scenes, badgers were pinned down by a rake held by an unknown person while Carter filmed his dogs barbarically attacking them.    Another vile video showed two dogs tearing a fox apart, while it was likely to have still been alive. But despite his catalogue of savage crimes against animals, which almost cost one of his own dogs its jaw, Carter was spared jail and placed on a community payback order. Procurator fiscal Ziad Ul Hassan said: “The expert opinion is that the fox may have been alive at the shooting of the clip.” Sherf Andrew McIntyre has also banned the teen, from Greenock, Inverclyde, Scotland, from owning or keeping any animals for  years. The three dogs have now been successfully rehomed. Fiscal Mr Ul Hassan said Carter used a ‘high powered portable spotlight’ to find foxes and deer in the dead of night for his canines to attack, fight and kill. He also used his dogs to lure badgers out from their sett before trapping them at the surface and torturing them, causing extreme pain and suffering, and killing them. Mr Ul Hassan said: “Laddie was missing all four of his central upper incisors.    “There were multiple areas of extensive scarring of the gums, inside the lips and around the teeth. “His lower lip was thickened and pigmented from previous severe traumatic injuries. “It was torn, in part, away from its attachment to the gum of the lower jaw. “The edge of the lower lip was also deformed due to severe traumatic injury. “The area under the chin was thickened there were multiple deep scars and multiple previous injuries.” Carter, who committed the cruel crimes over a period of six months, was exposed last June after concern for his three pets was reported to the Scottish SPCA.He used Facebook messenger to send his videos, eight of which were played in court, and text messages about the hunts.A Scottish SPCA investigations team obtained a warrant to search Carter’s two-storey housing association home on June  last year. An officer from the unit said: “The footage and pictures we uncovered are gut-wrenching.

He asked me to book him in sick for his day sht, as he didn’t think he’d make work the next day. He told me he loved me and not to be scared about anything.

He showed signs of improvement on day two and three in hospital – but only for short periods of time before any hope would be quickly quashed when things would take a downward turn.

I donapost believe that people who write and say these things about our town have even been to actually see the place - see how human it is, how we rally together during times of hardship or need. If I was reading this report maybe  years ago, Iaposd say I might agree with the bleak outlook - but since then the town is a whole dferent place. Even in the last five or six years, the changes have been incredible and we are a people who are proud of that change. I write plays in the town, about the town and also organise the Merthyr Rising festival which celebrates who we are through music.    The arts scene is really rising - yes we donapost have our Hoover factory anymore which employed , people, but young people in our town are growing in confidence to do things dferently. They are realising they can become popstars, actors, artists - whatever they want. When I hear Merthyr being stigmatised now, I just say to people come and see, come and look at what we are actually doing here. Yes, we know we have our problems, but so does every other town in the UK - in the whole world in fact. We have people who take drugs like Spice, there is unemployment - but we are getting there. We are used to this negative press, we get it all the time, but it helps us to grow stronger and even more determined. Josh Chambers, dad of Mia, , who was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in     For me, my daughter Mia was saved by Merthyr Tydfil. Mia fell unwell in early  when a cancerous lump was discovered in her stomach and then she was taken to Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital. Thankfully, Miaaposs neuroblastoma was cured, but doctors told us there was a % chance of a relapse which was absolutely terrying. We were told £, treatment in America could help with these odds, but that kind of money was madness to us. Miaaposs mum Kirsty and myself quietly thought about how we could get the money - even looking at selling our home - basically giving up everything we had. We originally kept our struggle to ourselves because weaposre private people, but when Miaaposs story got out in the town, because stuff does spread easily here, the community didnapost just sit back and say aposaw thataposs sadapos  - they actively went out of their way to help my little girl - a little girl they didnapost even know. Iaposve never seen people with so little give so much.  Miaaposs symbol in the town became colourful bows that thousands of people attached to their house and cars and she was known as the aposRainbow Warriorapos. The bows were made at a florists called Suzanneaposs Florist - who sold them for Miaaposs fund.  There were six or seven women working  hours days to make the ribbons and Suzanne would only take the cost of the ribbons, she wouldnapost accept any money for the time. The bows were something so simple that were able to achieve so much. Itaposs amazing, people have come up to me with rainbow tattoos. Just the other day I saw a man with one of the rainbow tattoos and I didnapost know him from Adam. I still canapost get over what has happened. Yes, we would never have chosen this path for Mia, but through it, it has given Merthyr such a good name and shown that the people here are good, caring people who might not live in luxury, but have so much to give back. Jarvis Morgan, , band member of Pretty Vicious     Merthyr for us is where we found and grew our love for music and the band. We first started the band in , and the people in the town were just so supportive of us - our first two gigs at the old Town Hall sold out. I think this shows people in Merthyr like to see people do good things with their le, like to see people from the town succeed. Most of the lyrics in our songs are about growing up here as itaposs been a massive influence on our music. Cave Song is about knocking about on street corners when there’s nothing to do, and having to find your own fun. I love Merthyr because out of nothing comes something that is beautul. When there’s nothing around you find other things to do and that makes you raise your goals. You get sick of hanging around and itaposs true you can get into drugs and drink - or you can pick up a guitar and form a band. Yes, people say Merthyr is bad and has bad people - but you could say the same anywhere. I always feel safe here and I always feel welcomed by the communitiy. Thereaposs also so much going on in the town now - people are trying out acting, music and doing things dferently than they may have before. Iaposve lived here all my le and when we tour as a band, it is always nice to come home and walk past the same people, see the same familiar, friendly faces. Charlotte James, , creative arts director  Charlotte James and photographer Clémentine Schneidermann embarked on a three year project picturing children of Merthyr Tydfil for a series called aposItaposs Called Ffasiwn apos. The exhibitionaposs title comes from the moment Charlotte spotted a group of girls from a local youth centre on the streets of Merthyr having their picture taken when a group of boys stopped to watch and laughed at them. They boldly replied Itaposs called fashion, look it up. Charlotte and Clementine went on to stage workshops for children of the town-teaching photography to those behind the lens and styling and customisation for the aspiring models and designers. Speaking about the town, Charlotte said: I was once a kid from the area. There isn’t easy access to culture.

Debbie Cooper, , was shocked to learn that her partner of  years, Mark, , had a le-limiting illness and had been given a maximum of two years to live. Mr Cooper began to feel unwell in August  after ing from a family holiday and went to get checked out. But his health continued to decline and he was told by doctors in May he had motor neurone disease.Mrs Cooper told Hull Live : Mark was always a fit and healthy man and cycled and played golf every weekend and even used to play for Hull City.   But Mark started to become unwell after we came back from holiday last August and said he felt aposfunnyapos and had aches and pains and sounded slurred and drunk when he spoke. He got checked out and doctors thought heaposd had a stroke but was treated for that and still got worse. He lost a lot of weight and started Googling his symptoms. He already had an idea of what it might be but didnapost want to frighten me. When Mark went to the hospital again and was told that he had motor neurone disease, it was just the worst news as there is no cure. She added: The diagnosis was devastating and it was something that I thought happened to other people, but that it would never happen to our family.    If Mark had been told he had cancer, I think Iaposd be able to deal with that as both my parents died of cancer so I can understand it more, and at least there are some cures for cancer, but MND is incurable. Faced with Mr Cooper losing the ability to walk and talk, the couple decided to move their wedding and honeymoon forward to ensure that he would still be fit enough to walk down the aisle and say his vows. The day was bittersweet for the couple, but they both enjoyed their day and the family holiday in Turkey that doubled up as a honeymoon. Mrs Cooper added: It was a fabulous but emotional day. Weaposve both been married before but this time the wedding was everything we wanted and more. My -year-old son gave me away as Iaposve lost both parents and that in itself was emotional.

She had been considering quitting her DJ career because she had lost her confidence to get up on stage when she was overweight, but is now getting more work than ever alongside her work as a model.    This week she was asked to DJ at the UK Glamour Awards ceremony, and was also a nominee in its model of the year category - but had not told anyone as she didnapost believe she would ever come close to winning. But she was shocked to be crowned the winner and revealed she was planning to tuck into a Burger King for the first time in six months, followed by an ice-cream, to celebrate. She said: I hadnapost been overweight until I fell pregnant with my first child. I just ate literally whatever I was not meant to, which I enjoyed at the time, but I pilled on the pounds. The last time I weighed myself I was .st.  After I gave birth I tried to lose the weight and feel like me again, but within six months I was pregnant with my second daughter and it happened all over again.

Sometimes I get up at am and do  minutes on the cross trainer wearing  kilos of weights. People think that sounds a lot but I was carrying a lot more than that when I was overweight.  I also go to the gym, run and I have two horses so I enjoy horse riding. Sometimes I do look at my cross trainer and think I canapost be bothered, then all I do is just think about what Iaposm trying to achieve and after Iaposve done it I feel so much better. My goals have changed along the way but what I want now is to keep my DJ career going and the modelling. Luckily both go hand in hand, and I just want to be happy and healthy.

It’s shown the tough time many communities are having. But it’s told stories of wonderful people too. Hardworking, honest people with pride in their home towns – despite today’s problems. They give me hope for the future. But they desperately need a new deal. Many of these towns were once powerhouses of industry. They made Britain a wealthy nation and offered good working-class jobs you could build a le on. But when those industries closed, the jobs that replaced them were low-paid and insecure.  Then after the financial crisis, communities that were already down took another a kicking from a decade of austerity.It’s time to do right by our towns again.

What do you think about it  Are you facing any issues  Email webnews@mirror or call       There’s an election coming, so my message to all the parties is this. Firstly, invest in our towns to attract good employers and create decent jobs. That means modern transport links and new centres of green industry across the UK. We can win the battle against climate change and create great new jobs while we’re at it. And we need a National Investment Bank to target investment to towns where good jobs are in short supply.Secondly, the next government must rebuild public services.  Austerity has done deep harm to Britain. And the worst damage is to towns that were already struggling.Every town needs good schools and hospitals, safe neighbourhoods and truly affordable homes. So in this election, let’s hear about long-term plans to fund all of our services properly. And that means restoring what was cut in full. Finally, politicians must give back power to workers.The industries that once made these towns wealthy had strong unions. But in recent decades, working people have been silenced.

He bravely spoke toabout his anger issues after failing to deal with his grief. And he says he struggled to find the courage to speak out and access help.  His issues came to a head when he lost his job abroad and was forced tohome but could no longer live with his dad.  Aaron ended up living on the streets before finding a place to stay at the YMCA.  “I did good in my GCSEs, went to college and studied public services,” he said. “I didn’t have a good home le, I lost my mum when I was young and nothing felt right in my head after that. Nothing was the same.  “I did grieve a lot, I was very angry and out of control, breaking everything up and taking my temper out on people.  “It still sticks with me now.”    Despite his struggles, Aaron said he was “too stubborn” to try and speak to someone and tried to deal with his issues alone.  “You feel like you’re the only one in that circle or bubble that you’re in who knows anything about it. It’s quite personal so opening up to people takes a while,” he said.  “When I did speak to people I felt no one really took it on board, they tell you: ‘yeah, you’ll be alright’. But you don’t really say that to someone.” After finishing his studies Aaron went to work in Calais where he had an eight-month contract working for an activity centre.  But his mental health started to decline when his contract wasn’t renewed.  He said: “I just gave up because I hated everything and nothing was going right for me. I came back to my parents but I didn’t like it.  “So I ended up on the streets. I was depressed before and then that spiked it.”  He said he felt helpless and ashe had no one to turn to while he was homeless.  “I struggled to hold down a job too, I had a part-time job working two hours every morning and I was still doing it even though I was living in a tent,” he explains. “It was hard to stay clean like washing your clothes, and obviously you have from place to place because as soon as people know who you are they can come and trash it so you need to keep on top of that.  “So you’re constantly having to move place and I was asking my family membersI could move in but no one would.  “It felt like I was the black sheep of the family, that they were just pushing me away.” After spending two months living rough, Aaron went to Citizens Advice who helped him find a place to stay at the YMCA. He said: “It takes the pressure of trying to look after yourself, there’s regular meals but I struggle with looking for work because of my depression.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton feeling more confident","story":"NewsKate Middleton feeling more confident and has gone from student to future QueenKate Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge in April  after marrying Prince William and officially taking her spot in the Royal FamilyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video nervous-kate-middleton-makes-first-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

British Transport Police were called to Laindon station in Essex during rush hour last night following reports that a man had assaulted a security guard. A witness who shot the footage said security at the station had been trying to stop three men but two had managed to board trains and get away. Footage shows a man climbing over a partition at the station as guards stand the other side. He then fixes his glasses as he jumps onto the train tracks and attempts to scarper.  The camera pans back to show the guards watching him in disbelief as he disappears down the side of the tracks. His getaway was short-lived though as he was caught by police moments later. A witness, who only wanted to be named as Ben, recorded the video to share on social media. He said: I heard commotion going on. There was security at the train station trying to contain three people.  Two of them jumped the ticket barriers, got onto a train to London and this guy was left on his own. He didnapost get very far and police caught him two minutes down the road.

Brave Jayne Carpenter, , has vowed to walk again despite losing both legs and an arm to the cruel infection. Jayne, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, is speaking out on World Sepsis Day, hoping to raise awareness of the condition. When her le was turned upside down, she told husband Robert, , that he could leave herhe wished to. Three years on from her ordeal Jayne is now fundraising for a new set of articial limbs that she says will transform her le.    Jayne said: Itaposs been completely devastating and le changing. Getting sepsis is something you never predict will happen to you. It turned my world upside down. I havenapost let it defeat me but I do get my dark moments. Her illness began in April  when she developed what she thought was a cough. She said: Iaposd had quite bad cough and was coughing up dark coloured phlegm. I was getting worse and I just thought it was a virus.    The following day I woke up and felt short of breath and couldnapost walk anywhere. I thought it was a cough, as a nurse I thought it was something fairly trivial so didnapost want to make a fuss. Jayne described her symptoms to her local GP who advised her to go to AE but did not suspect that she had the early stages of deadly sepsis. Initially told that she had pneumonia her condition quickly began to deteriorate and she entered a coma. Jayne spent the next nine weeks in hospital fighting for her le. Her husband Rob was told his we would die unless she had a triple amputation. In total she lost four of her fingers on her right hand, her left arm below the elbow and both her legs. Jayne said the last three years of recovery have brought huge challenges to her.  She said: Three years on and Iaposve really struggled, I thought my le couldnapost improve beyond what itaposs like at the moment. There were three points this year where I got close to ending my own le, itaposs been horrendous. Itaposs like a grieving process, Iaposve grieved for the le I once had and the ability to do so many of the small things you take for granted such as being able to go for a swim. I canapost put my own jewellery on, I rely on my husband to put my shoes on, it takes away my femininity. I try and do as much as I can but have to ask Robert to do lots of things, heaposs been a real rock. Jayne said that despite being told sheaposs lucky to be alive, coming to terms with the limits she faces has been dficult.

As they embrace and discuss what ice cream they will have, they look like any other couple in the first throes of love. But they have already been married  years – after becoming the first Down’s syndrome couple in the UK to tie the knot in . They have enjoyed the longest marriage of anybody with the condition and everyone who knows them says their romance is like a “fairytale”. Maryanne, , says: “I love him. I loved him from the first time I met him.”    And pointing towards his wedding ring, Tommy, , adds: “I wear this every day. I married her, I did.” From their daily walks on the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, to rustling up something special in the kitchen, they have done everything together since meeting at a le skills training centre in July . Sadly, Tommy lost both parents by  and was in residential care – but Maryanne’s family took him under their wing.After  months, Tommy bought a plastic ring from a vending machine and, having asked permission from Maryanne’s mum, Linda Martin, he popped the question. Linda, , says: “When I sent out the invitations people said it wouldn’t last and asked me what I’d doit didn’t.   But we need to treat Tommy and Maryanne like adults. Everyone should be able to marry the love of their lives.” The big day itself was certainly something to remember as  family and friends gathered at church in . Maryanne says: “We got married on July . I had a white dress and I wore a crown like a princess.And Tommy was in a suit with a shirt and tie. My wedding day was the best day of my le. I love my husband. He is my best friend.” Maryanne and Tommy then moved in with Linda before getting their own flat, next door, in .   Linda says: “They would talk all the time, from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep. I had to bang on the wall because they’d be in hysterics. “They also cooked with me every night and I taught them the basics of how to make fresh dinners. These two are marvellous in the kitchen. That’s where Tommy gets into his element.” When we visit Tommy and Maryanne in their flat, their pride shines through. Maryanne says: “I clean it every day.” The couple’s love for music is also apparent, as the apartment is crammed with Elvis memorabilia. There is even wallpaper with the King’s face and a cuckoo clock that plays his songs. So it comes as no surprise when Tommy sings Love me Tender to his we. “I sing this to her every day,” he says. “I sang it when we got married too.”    Maryanne nods while cradling a heart-shaped locket containing a photo of them with their names engraved. The couple renewed their vows on their th wedding anniversary in , in front of  people. And every year, they are keen to celebrate their anniversary and show the world their love. But devastatingly, Tommy may not be able to remember their th anniversary next year. He was diagnosed with dementia five years ago and already struggles to do day-to-day tasks like tying his shoelaces or washing his hair.Heartbreakingly, he also sometimes forgets who Maryanne is. If he continues to decline, her family fear they may be forced to separate for the first time.    Maryanne’s sister Lindi Newman, , says: “He’s forgotten who Maryanne is a handful of times. He pushes her away and says, ‘I don’t know who you are’ and ‘I don’t love you’.Maryanne takes that to heart and is hysterical. She calls me and I go across the road to calm them down. It’s scary for Tommy too but then he forgets anything has happened. “We tell her Tommy forgets things because his brain’s a bit poorly and he’s getting older.But we take each day as it comes because we’ve been toldTommy needs residential care, Maryanne wouldn’t be able to go with him. We’d do whatever we could to stop it happening.” Maryanne is also determined to do everything she can to help Tommy. Lindi says: “Tommy can’t put his own shoes on or fasten his jewellery or watches. Maryanne also helps him in and out of the bath, helps get him get dressed and things like that.”Maryanne chips in: “I tell him I love him three times a day. We have kisses and cuddles. I do all I can.” And this is clear to see when we head to the beach, as she grabs Tommy’s hand and leads him in the right direction. “Come on, Tom,” she grins as they point out their favourite lunch spots and pubs. “We just like spending time together,” she adds. “Sometimes we get an ice cream and a shandy.” And when Tommy stumbles, Maryanne is right there to support him. “Easy, tiger,” she laughs as she steadies him.  The pair are working to make new memories and will go to Disneyland this summer with Lindi and her family. Lindi says: “Next year, when Maryanne and Tommy reach  years, my husband and I will have been married  and my mother-in-law and father-in-law  – so we have a huge celebration planned with all the family going on holiday.Every year they have together is special and we make the most of it. And I always take lots of photos and have them put into an album for Tommy to help his memory.”Devoted Tommy and Maryanne have also won the hearts of , Facebook followers.Lindi says: “There’s just so much love that comes through there. Tommy and Maryanne have set the bar throughout their relationship. It’s literally a fairytale."},{"url":null,"title":"van driver caught waving phone","story":"NewsVan driver caught waving phone in the air while driving along dual carriagewayEXCLUSIVE: The man was spotted travelling along the A, near Oxford - a stretch of road that has seen numerous fatal crashes in recent yearsShareCommentsByRachel Endley :,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video van-driver-hold-phone-above-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

His post quickly went viral, garnering over , likes and more than , retweets - but can you see what people thought was wrong with the sign   Dr Hornsby captioned his post: Great advert from the British Library. The sign reads: Shops. Cafés. The whole wealth of human knowledge, endeavour and experience to date. Events. Exhibitions. And while many might think this is perfectly fine, others were quick to argue that the British Library should have included an Oxford comma after the word endeavour. The controversial piece of punctuation is typically used as the final comma in a list of three or more things to help prevent confusion, being placed before the words aposandapos or aposorapos.  People on Twitter were ided over whether or not it should have been used here. One person replied, saying: Love it!

However, others didnapost think the piece of punctuation needed to be used in this instance. Someone  said: I don’t think an Oxford comma is necessary in this particular sentence it isn’t ambiguous.

That early-season success, however, has come as no surprise to Robbie.“I know Ian, I meet him now and again because he stays near me. I know what he’s been through, it’s the nature of being at most clubs in the Championship,” he said.“Most of the players are on one-year deals. We’ve managed to get a few of them on two and three-year deals and that gives you stability. Others don’t have the finances to make mistakesso only hand out one-year contracts.“Sometimes you make mistakes and it’s good they are only on a year but the ones who do really well, they move on and it’s part and parcel of things.“But Ian did well last year and he’s done a really good job again at the start of the season.“Ian’s really good at getting a team spirit. He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months. Ian’s managed to get time down there and, hopefully, I get that here because it gives you the chance to make a football club.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d78bb98b82f97.85860635.jpg ","title":"johnny russell delighted united are back on track following dundee derby win","story":"Former Dundee United star Johnny Russell says he’s delighted to see his old side finally heading in the right direction.And after enjoying watching the Tangerines’ - thumping of rivals Dundee, Russell says he’s even planning ato watch his former team when he comes back to Scotland during the MLS close season.Currently a favourite at Sporting Kansas City where he’s scored seven goals in  MLS appearances this campaign as they chase down a play-off spot, the -year-old admits he keeps close attention to how United are faring.He told the Tele: “I always keep an eye on what Dundee United are doing.“I watched the derby a few weeks ago which was good.“If there are any games on involving my old teams then I’ll always watch them.“United are doing great and look to be going in the right direction.“It’s been a dficult few years for them, being out of the top league, but hopefully this year they can get back – that would be great to see.“My season is finishing soon so I’ll, hopefully, get a couple of games in when I’m back as well.”The recent derby saw , fans pack into Tannadice to see the City of Discovery’s two sides battle it out in the Championship.Russell added: “It was good to see the full house at Tannadice, it seemed like a good atmosphere – and it was a good game to watch as well.“Especially for United fans!“I do keep an eye on all my old teams and all the United boys.

However, the city council said this could be reviewed at a later date.It is understood from sources close to the project that work should begin on the smaller Newton of Charleston development, comprising just  homes, by the end of this year.Meanwhile, construction work could begin on the wider Loirston development by the “tail end” of next year or into .Officers at Aberdeen City Council have produced an updating planning framework for the area which will be presented to the local authority’s planning committee next week.They have been asked to agree putting the proposals out to public consultation to give residents the chance to have their say.Councillor Sarah Duncan, who represents Cove, Nigg and Kincorth, urged the public to have their say in any future consultation.She said: “It is essential the revised framework goes out for public consultation as any development around Loirston Loch is of signicant interest to people living in Nigg, Redmoss, Cove and Kincorth.“There have been changes in the area since the original framework was published, not least Lochside Academy and Balmoral stadium, so it’s appropriate now that local people can see what might happen and comment on that.”The city council’s planning committee will be asked to approve the content of the development framework and to agree that the proposals go out to public consultation for a minimum of four weeks.The views of the public consultation would then be reported back to a future meeting of the committee within the next six months."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits, explained Shirley.ldquoWe hope there will be many more initiatives for community growing starting up in other Border towns and villages.It might be a wrap for the film crew, but these community horticulturists continue to work hard growing fresh fruit and vegetables in their tasty gardens throughout the year.ITV will be airing the show later this month, and being involved in the creation of a community garden which is fresh, free and enhances the environment is a worthy  minutes claim to fame."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-set-toast-peebles-highland-games","story":"FORMER athletics coach

-bedroom hotel closed in  after owners Roy and Lorna Curry had failed to make the business profitable.Plans were submitted by Rikeja Ltd with the local authority the following year for an extension to be added and  apartments to be created.A spokesman said: \"The proposal to alter, extend and convert the hotel to form  apartments represents an appropriate use for the building restoring it to its original residential use and by doing so increasing the choice and range of accommodation available in the area.\"The alterations required to facilitate that change of use can be undertaken in a manner which not only preserves but also enhances the character and appearance of the building as one of special architectural character and appearance.\"The impacts associated with the proposed use of the property for residential purposes will also be signicantly less that those associated with its established use.\"Venlaw Castle was built on the site of Smithfield Castle in  by the Sherf Deputy

additional floor and also a baronial wing to the property.The castle was used as a Red Cross Hospital during World War I.And eventually, just after the Second World War, it was converted into an upmarket hotel.But a downturn in trade and several takeovers later the doors closed in December, .The plans for apartments, which were submitted the following year, won support from Scottish Borders Council at their planning meeting in March.Planning officer Ranald Dods said: \"The proposal as submitted is, on balance, not considered to be sufficiently detrimental to the character of the listed building to warrant a recommendation of refusal.\"The proposals contained in the planning application are considered acceptable.\"But continued concerns from Historic Environmental Scotland over the proposed changes to the listed building has led to the governments Planning and Environmental Appeals Division calling the application in.A decision is likely to be made during the

It wasnrsquot le-ruining, but it always felt a little wrong.I accepted that everyone felt like this, that being an adult meant existing with a mild sense of crawling discomfort under your skin each time someone addressed you. Eventually, I figured out that is not quite true.I first realised I was non-binary after talking with a trans friend about their identity a few years ago. To identy as something, you need to know that it exists and I had been pretty ignorant of the whole LGBT community prior to going to university.I spent months thinking about it before mentioning being trans to my closest friends, and it was even longer before I tentatively started introducing myself with they pronouns and began asking close friends to use they and them for me.Deciding to use they pronouns was of a leap into the dark. As I had only recently realised that I was trans, there was a fear that somehow I was lying to myself, and that my identity was a sham.However, the more people who started calling me they, the more I realised how right it felt, and how finally I had found a way of being seen by others which matched with the way I saw myself.Having those four letters attached to my identity was a simple way to be recognised and it gave me an answer to something I did not know I was missing.A lot of people in my le took time to adjust. Many friends found it hard to separate my still quite feminine presentation from my gender identity. But I know theyrsquore trying, and for me a sincere attempt is good enough.Being non-binary does not mean I cannot enjoy dresses and make-up, because they are not exclusively for women. Those things are for everyone, just as Sam Smith can wear suits without their gender being questioned.It was a gradual process with my grandmother, who went from refusing to learn what a pronoun is to mostly getting things right.Being fundamentally recognised by those closest to me brought more joy than I realised was possible, as did coming out professionally. Even now, a colleague casually using ldquothey for me is quite emotional.Sam Smith and thousands of other non-binary people are out in a society which struggles to accept all trans people, where we are taught about a strict gender binary even as children.Having they pronouns listed in my Twitter bio adds a transphobic twist to the abuse I receive on the , combined with jokes about identying as an attack helicopter, or grammatical arguments about the use of they as a singular.Sometimes questions are made in good faith, from people who simply do not know about trans issues but want to respect people for who they are.The voices of those who intentionally use pronouns as a way of hurting people are often louder than those who support them, and there will be a lot of people who simply refuse to understand.But I cannot help but hope that Sam Smith publicly using they pronouns will bring more of these good faith questions to light and in turn produce more allies to the whole LGBT community.For me at least, being my authentic self is worth the backlash and I really hope they feel the same..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sam Smith news gives hope to non-binary community"},{"url":null,"title":"competition heats up on stronvaar green","story":"The tournament was well supported by the two local clubs and others from mid-Argyll and beyond and the round robin sections of four matches were keenly contested.The semi-finals featured two triples from CBC, Argyll BC and Vale of Leven BC, and these resulted in a final between Campbeltown’s Steven Dickson, Neil Maguire and Hugh Newlands and Vale’s Colin McIntyre, Grant MacLeod and Robert Scott.A good crowd gathered around the green to watch the match and saw the Vale trio take control with MacLeod the stand-out performer gaining the shots that mattered to give his team a decisive win.President Bobby Dalziel thanked Archie and Tracy for their generous sponsorship of the event and invited them to present the trophy and prizes."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils stay cool to catch late winner","story":"Campbeltown Pupils applied the perfect finish to their pre-season preparations with a hard-fought win over Rhu.Having been regular visitors to the Caledonian League side’s summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

I think just about everybody knows the importance of bees by now, but we are attempting to ensure our youngsters do too, by running an incredibly popular educational effort with our local schools. The children paint a hive and in conjunction with Webster Honey from Kinross,we visit each school for a presentation about bees, and then in summer, the best part, we hire buses and bring the kids to the Reserve, pop them in little bee suits and open up the hive and let them see and understand bees up close.Thenew facility, offering a forever home for injured Hedgehogs is also proving popular, with  hogs passing through to release and one injured one staying in the enclosure and being cared for byvolunteers.

Firstly, the reader must be able to walk in the subjectrsquos shoes and inhabit their world. It must also have a fair scattering of interesting ndash the more gasp-inducing the better ndash personal anecdotes and revelations. And finally, perhaps most crucially, it should reveal something universal about le itself. Good memoirs have one or two of these attributes great memoirs possess them all.How many ndashany ndash will David Cameronrsquos hotly-anticipated book contain, I wonder  The former prime ministerrsquos memoir, For The Record, is due out in  daysrsquo time, which means by rights I should already be able to answer that question. It is normal protocol for editors and reviewers to be sent copies weeks, sometimes months, in advance, but this book is apparently so hot it will stay under lock and key until the release date of September .Does this mean Mr Cameron is about to spill the beans on Boris Johnson  Does he have something up his sleeve that could bring down his old Eton, Oxford and Bullingdon Club chum  Are we to take it the revelations contained in this book are so explosive they will cause another major tremor in what has been a summer of political earthquakes : Johnson called Cameron a girly swotI fear those of hoping for such an outcome will be let down. After all, with Mr Cameron reportedly paid pound, in advance for the book ndash therersquos also a TV series in the offing ndash itrsquos more likely his publishers are simply ensuring they get plenty of bang for their buck. Indeed,there was anyone left who believed Mr Cameron had been laying low over the last three years because he feels ashamed about the misery and chaos he has inflicted upon the rest of us by holding the EU referendum, the penny must surely have dropped that he is under contract to keep schtum.By rights, of course, this is a man who should, evenonly in print, fall on his knees and beg forgiveness from us all. So arrogant and wrong-headed was his decision-making that we now sit on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit that has the potential to cause economic, political and social misery. Not that wealthy, privileged, cosseted Mr Cameron and his family will suffer its effects, of course, just as he clearly didnrsquot feel any sympathy or responsibility towards the families and communities he and his government plunged into austerity from  onwards.Evenno-deal can be avoided, the damaging isions Mr Camerons referendum created and fed upon will last for generations. To say he changed his country for the worse is an understatement. As for the apology he owes the people of Libya, thatrsquos another can of worms.Andthe memoirs of his predecessors are anything to go by, rather than apology and candour, Mr Cameronrsquos tome will be filled with dull procedure, maddening attempts to deflect blame and crass legacy-making.As for the standard of writing, it will be interesting to seehe has more talent than some of the previous inhabitants of Number . Even that great verbal communicator Tony Blair revealed himself to be a terrible writer his  book overflowed with clicheacute and wince-inducing pop psychology. Werenrsquot there also some really bad sex scenes  Crucially, he refused to confront Iraq.:David Cameron toto political limelight next month to publicise his autobiography For The RecordGordon Brownrsquos memoir ndash with its ghastly title My Le, Our Times ndash was criminally dull, as was John Majorrsquos, which I remember reading on my sickbed in the early Noughties after picking it up in an actual bargain bin for p. I only read two volumes of Mrs Thatcherrsquos autobiography and can attest that despite the grand delusion, at least they werenrsquot boring.For a truly skilled and revelatory take on the political world, we must turn to those who surround the powerful. All three volumes of Alastair Campbellrsquos diaries make for scintillating reading, as do those of the late Tory MP Alan Clark. Neither Campbell nor Clark emerge as likeable people, yet both are talented writers who exude wit, humour and honesty in spades. Their books embed readers in their heads, shock us, and in dferent ways, tell us about the nature of power.Mr Cameronrsquos publishers claim he will ldquotalk candidly, though itrsquos hard to imagine this former PR man, who, in common with his pal Mr Johnson has never seemed burdened by self-doubt, will feel the need or inclination to explain himself to the likes of us. Sorry Dave ndash I fear the giant bargain bin in the ether awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-giant-gets-set-no-deal-brexit","story":"But it declared the long-term growth prospects for whisky around the world will not be impeded by the current upheaval caused by Brexit.Top executives of Chivas owner Pernod Ricard briefedjournalists yesterday at the distillerrsquos new head office on Glasgowrsquos Blythswood Square, which is now home to around  back office staff who have moved from its former headquarters in Paisley.Th maker of Ballantinersquos, Chivas Regal and Royal Salute is shting its bottling operation from Paisley to a ldquostate of the art facility in Dumbarton, where it has invested pound million in its Kilmalid site. The Kilmalid plant will be fully operational next year.Asked whether the distiller has prepared for a no-deal Brexit, Chivas chief executive Jean-Christophe Coutures, who appeared alongside executive chairman Alexandre Ricard and Christian Porta, chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, said: ldquoI canrsquot comment on the outcome of it . The only thing I would say is that, as a business, what we want is visibility. It is very dficult to forecast and to plan for the unknown.:Chivas owner lts profit forecasts for yearldquoNow we are firmly preparing for a no-deal Brexit, with the expectation that there will be a deal. It has always been our position, but we have to prepare for the worst.Mr Coutures said the distillerrsquos preparations involve ensuring it has sufficient supplies of glass, bottle closures and labels.He noted: ldquoWe are lucky enough in Pernod to have a very strong distribution network of sister companies, and in the last six months we have been moving finished goods inventory for key markets and SKUs , in particular the European Union, by increasing all inventory in those markets. It doesnrsquot impact our sell out terms, because it is internal .ldquoThe other point which is important to note is that we hardly use trucks in Chivas Bros. We mainly use ports and boats to transport our products, so we believe will be in a better place than others in that context.:Activist turns heat on whisky giant PernodObserving that it was impossible to predict the outcome of the political crisis, he added: ldquoThe only thing I know, [is that] we are ready, and I am firmly of the view that Scotch, no matter what, will continue growing, and I donrsquot expect any slowdown because of Brexit. I think the dynamics of the category remain extremely positive.However, Mr Ricard said there could be an effect on Scotch and Irish whiskey exportsUS President Donald Trump moves to impose tarfs on imports of European spirits.He said: ldquoThe US is a huge market for European spirits, particularly for Scotch, Irishand Cognac, so it would have somewhat of an impact of course.Mr Ricard declared the distillerrsquos Scotch whisky portfolio continues to be ldquobig driver of the firmrsquos financial performance. Pernod reported organic profit growth of . per cent in its  financial year, underpinned by growth of % on Chivas Regal, % for Ballantinersquos, % for The Glenlivet and % for Royal Salute.Mr Ricard said: ldquoLetrsquos be very clear: our Scotch business, which is the biggest part of our portfolio, is driving that growth, and we are extremely happy about it.While he observed that the .% growth in exports reported recently by the Scotch Whisky Association, to pound.bn in the first half of , reflected stock-building by some distillers, he said Pernodrsquos figures did not.Mr Ricard said: ldquoUnlike us, a lot of our competitors donrsquot have... sister companies inmarkets. It means they have been pushing inventories to third parties, which impacted, eventually, their sell-out.He added: ldquoIn thosenumbers, it is genuine numbers. Brexit or not Brexit, the numbers would have been exactly those.Mr Ricard downplayed the effects of the Hong Kong protests on sales in the special administrative region. He noted that the Hong Kong market is relatively small, and the only disruption occurs when the airport has been closed and sales of whisky are impeded in travel retail stores.Mr Ricard said the potential for exports to China remain strong, noting that on the basis of demographics, urbanisation trends and demand for whisky and Cognac, he is confident of achieving sales growth in high single digit to low double-digit percentage terms ldquofor the foreseeable future.Mr Coutures outlined Pernodrsquos commitment to invest poundm per year in Scotch whisky distilling, manufacturing and logistics. The investment includes plans to upgrade the visitor experiences at The Glenlivet and Strathisla distilleries on Speyside.With regard to Strathisla, the ldquooldest commercial distillery on Speyside, Mr Coutures said the aim is to ldquobring to le the story of Chivas and the distillery. ldquoOur approach will not be to do something large scale, with a multi-hundred-million [pound] investment, but to respect the distillery as it stands, he said.He added that plans for The Glenlivet will allow visitors to enjoy aspects of Scottish nature.

First we need to give councils the power of consent when someone proposes changing a home to a holiday home, and also we need to allow social home providers, community organisations and local authorities to purchase land at closer to the original value.ldquoWhen land is sold with planning permission or the perception that it will be used for housebuilding then you can add pound, on to the asking price, even for rough arable land.He added: ldquoSelling it for what it is actually worth, not to private builders but to councils and social housing providers, would allow more house to be built as budgets could be stretched further.Faisal Faisal Choudhry, director of Scottish Research and Residential Research at estate agents Savills, said that house price growth had not been as big a barrier to purchasing a home in rural areas as it has in the cities.Instead, the problem has been supply for the housing market and the number of new homes being built.He said: ldquoThe lack of houses in rural areas and the dficulty people experience purchasing a property is not because of house price growth, but because of a lack of choice.ldquoIf no new supply is coming on to the market then people are forced to stay renting or living with parents, and thatrsquos eventually not sustainable for young couples looking for their first home.He said that the amount of social housing being built had gone some way to alleviating the problem, but it still left people waiting months, or even years, to get the keys to their own home.Mr Choudhry said: ldquoWith social housing you have to be qualied to get on to the councilrsquos list, and it is means tested. And people can be waiting years in some cases.ldquoThey end up looking at areas where there are homes coming onto the market, such as Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and the Lothians, and move there.ldquoBut these places arenrsquot rural. People are faced with a choice: stay in the hope that something comes up, or up sticks and go to where the houses are.Three years ago, the Scottish government launched two projects, thepound million Rural Housing Fund and the poundm Islands Housing Fund, to provide grants and loans to groups building homes in areas where there is pressure on the housing market.According to the latest statistics from July, it has helped fund almost  homes, including new dwellings in Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney, the Highlands and Kinross.Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning, Kevin Stewart, said: ldquoWe remain on track to deliver at least , affordable homes by , including , for social rent, backed by record investment of more thanpound. billion. Our most recent official statistics show we have delivered more than , affordable homes since .ldquoThe poundm Rural and Islands Housing Funds were launched as part of wider housing policy to increase supply of long term affordable housing in rural areas.ldquoGiven the complex nature of rural housing projects, we extended the timescales for these funds from the initial three years to five to allowas many projects as possible to come forward.ldquoWe are also working to ensure those who aspire to home ownership are able to achieve it and over , households have been supported through our home ownership schemes since ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-campaigners-call-set-tougher-targets","story":"The Climate Change Bill will go to final vote in the Scottish Parliament on September .Stop Climate Chaos Scotland ndash a coalition of more than  charities and civil society organisations ndash yesterday handed in an open letter signed by thousands of people to Holyrood.The note stated that, while Scotlandrsquos declaration of a climate emergency is apositive step forward, politicians must use the Bill to sign our commitment to action into law.

She added: “Christmas and New Year is a time which should be spent with family, and there are few days in the year when families are off at the same time. “The results of Usdaw’s survey show that the overwhelming majority of respondents want to spend more time with their families during Christmas and New Year.“I hope all of my MSP colleagues will recognise that everyone deserves a day off for New Year and will support the motion that I have tabled in the Scottish Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It wasnrsquot le-ruining, but it always felt a little wrong.I accepted that everyone felt like this, that being an adult meant existing with a mild sense of crawling discomfort under your skin each time someone addressed you. Eventually, I figured out that is not quite true.I first realised I was non-binary after talking with a trans friend about their identity a few years ago. To identy as something, you need to know that it exists and I had been pretty ignorant of the whole LGBT community prior to going to university.I spent months thinking about it before mentioning being trans to my closest friends, and it was even longer before I tentatively started introducing myself with they pronouns and began asking close friends to use they and them for me.Deciding to use they pronouns was of a leap into the dark. As I had only recently realised that I was trans, there was a fear that somehow I was lying to myself, and that my identity was a sham.However, the more people who started calling me they, the more I realised how right it felt, and how finally I had found a way of being seen by others which matched with the way I saw myself.Having those four letters attached to my identity was a simple way to be recognised and it gave me an answer to something I did not know I was missing.A lot of people in my le took time to adjust. Many friends found it hard to separate my still quite feminine presentation from my gender identity. But I know theyrsquore trying, and for me a sincere attempt is good enough.Being non-binary does not mean I cannot enjoy dresses and make-up, because they are not exclusively for women. Those things are for everyone, just as Sam Smith can wear suits without their gender being questioned.It was a gradual process with my grandmother, who went from refusing to learn what a pronoun is to mostly getting things right.Being fundamentally recognised by those closest to me brought more joy than I realised was possible, as did coming out professionally. Even now, a colleague casually using ldquothey for me is quite emotional.Sam Smith and thousands of other non-binary people are out in a society which struggles to accept all trans people, where we are taught about a strict gender binary even as children.Having they pronouns listed in my Twitter bio adds a transphobic twist to the abuse I receive on the , combined with jokes about identying as an attack helicopter, or grammatical arguments about the use of they as a singular.Sometimes questions are made in good faith, from people who simply do not know about trans issues but want to respect people for who they are.The voices of those who intentionally use pronouns as a way of hurting people are often louder than those who support them, and there will be a lot of people who simply refuse to understand.But I cannot help but hope that Sam Smith publicly using they pronouns will bring more of these good faith questions to light and in turn produce more allies to the whole LGBT community.For me at least, being my authentic self is worth the backlash and I really hope they feel the same.copy -.

Now we know some of those people so we can get together again and join forces.#Pat McNicol who lives in Broadford said that after hearing about the local group #Broadford plastic free and beyond# she started to gather all the plastic from her weekly shop and was #horried# at the volume of plastic which was going to landfill.She said: #As iniduals, we can do something, and thenwe are a group of people acting collectively we can make changes.#Anne MacLennan from Lower Breakish commented: #I was in New Zealand for  years and was a climate activist there.I was heartened that the Government was doing the workshops # we need government action but they also need to know that there#s action from the bottom upwards.#Ardvasar resident Lysana Robinson said: #My father taught rural science and environmental studies, so I was the one in the greenhouse.#I have been an environmental activist for many years, I do moth trapping because it tells you more about the environment than looking at the flora because when things go wrong the population is decimated.#Trish Rogers from Broadford said: #I agree with Dorothy that climate change is the big one and I#ll do everything I can to get people involved.#Addressing what measures people could take to make a dference, she added: #There are things such as the circular economy, where people can recycle to avoid throwing things away.#She also went on to highlight the benefit of local and seasonal food, energy-efficient heating, and transport efficiency options like using public transport, car-sharing and cycling.Touching on the upcoming meeting, Ms Jackson said: #We will share some of the things that are already happening # there will be brief presentations. Then the idea is for people to go into local groups and talk about what they can do locally.#We will then have a picture of who is interested in doing what and come up with possibilities for people to link up and then we will try and work out where we can go from there.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2471_6September19_Page_01crop.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 6th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

It wasn’t le-ruining, but it always felt a little wrong.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  PA general news reporter Jess Glass I accepted that everyone felt like this, that being an adult meant existing with a mild sense of crawling discomfort under your skin each time someone addressed you. Eventually, I figured out that is not quite true.I first realised I was non-binary after talking with a trans friend about their identity a few years ago. To identy as something, you need to know that it exists and I had been pretty ignorant of the whole LGBT community prior to going to university.I spent months thinking about it before mentioning being trans to my closest friends, and it was even longer before I tentatively started introducing myself with they pronouns and began asking close friends to use they and them for me.Deciding to use they pronouns was of a leap into the dark. As I had only recently realised that I was trans, there was a fear that somehow I was lying to myself, and that my identity was a sham.Being fundamentally recognised by those closest to me brought more joy than I realised was possible, as did coming out professionally. Even now, a colleague casually using they for me is quite emotionalJess GlassHowever, the more people who started calling me they, the more I realised how right it felt, and how finally I had found a way of being seen by others which matched with the way I saw myself.Having those four letters attached to my identity was a simple way to be recognised and it gave me an answer to something I did not know I was missing.A lot of people in my le took time to adjust. Many friends found it hard to separate my still quite feminine presentation from my gender identity. But I know they’re trying, and for me a sincere attempt is good enough.Being non-binary does not mean I cannot enjoy dresses and make-up, because they are not exclusively for women. Those things are for everyone, just as Sam Smith can wear suits without their gender being questioned.It was a gradual process with my grandmother, who went from refusing to learn what a pronoun is to mostly getting things right.Today is a good day so here goes. I’ve decided I am changing my pronouns to THEY THEM ❤ after a letime of being at war with my gender I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out... pic IVoLTYbAWd— Sam SmithSeptember , Being fundamentally recognised by those closest to me brought more joy than I realised was possible, as did coming out professionally. Even now, a colleague casually using “they” for me is quite emotional.Sam Smith and thousands of other non-binary people are out in a society which struggles to accept all trans people, where we are taught about a strict gender binary even as children.Having they pronouns listed in my Twitter bio adds a transphobic twist to the abuse I receive on the , combined with jokes about identying as an attack helicopter, or grammatical arguments about the use of they as a singular.Sometimes questions are made in good faith, from people who simply do not know about trans issues but want to respect people for who they are.The voices of those who intentionally use pronouns as a way of hurting people are often louder than those who support them, and there will be a lot of people who simply refuse to understand.But I cannot help but hope that Sam Smith publicly using they pronouns will bring more of these good faith questions to light and in turn produce more allies to the whole LGBT community.For me at least, being my authentic self is worth the backlash and I really hope they feel the same."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit message hidden in newspaper crossword spotted by eagleeyed puzzlers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"key city deal innovation projects outlined derry strabane council","story":"A number of innovative projects are being developed by Ulster University which will be funded as part of the Derry City Deal.In a detailed report laid out by the Council’s Chief Executive, John Kelpie, and experts from Ulster University , local councillors were told that signicant progress had been made in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects since the initial City Deal funding announcement in May.In relation to strategic projects included in the City Deal, the core focus of the UK Government £M City Deal funding remains the delivery of the centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationtogether with the key smart digital City and Region initiatives.At the meeting, representatives from Ulster University said that Outline Business Cases in respect of these priority projects are currently being further developed in line with Government funding guidelines.The word “transformational” was used numerous times by the  of experts from Ulster University.It was explained to councillors how the Cognitive Analytics Research Lab or CARL is a new cutting-edge Applied Research Centre from Ulster University will bring together businesses, government and Articial Intelligence expertise with academia.It will consolidate the expertise that already exists at the University and complement it with new resources to create a centre that is world leading in research and dedicated specically to cognitive analytics.The CARL innovation centre would provide the city with global opportunities to become world class in areas such as software engineering, advanced networks and sensors, data analytics and cyber security and would offer huge potential to the city and wider region’s economic development.Referring to the Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automationinnovation project, councillors were told how the proposed innovation centre will support industry and commerce in Northern Ireland based at the Magee campus in the exploitation of industrial digital technologies, robotics and automation.Members were also informed that the overall aim of the CIDRA project is to future proof NI industry and provide pathways towards the development of innovative products and allow existing companies to increase their productivity.The importance of CIDRA in providing industrial and commercial support to businesses across Northern Ireland was highlighted to members who were informed that the innovation centre will focus on research, development and demonstration of the five key technologies – articial technologies, robotics, automation, the internet of things and industrial digital technologies – that are essential for future industrialisation.Once developed the centre will provide state of the art demonstrator facilities in robotics, automation and become a leader in pursuing international led research in the application of articial intelligence in industry and commerce. Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September. The people who left this device had every intention of killing my colleagues serving the Strabane community. They showed no regard for the families, elderly and vulnerable people who were forced to leave their homes and whose lives were put at risk.   As a parent myself it was terrying to hear local mother Aileen Mullan recount how close her children were to this deadly device.\"The New IRA members behind this attack are living in the community. They are building bombs and storing weapons and placing the community at risk. To further highlight the recklessness and total disregard shown by the New IRA,  a public safety operation is taking place in Creggan this morning th September involving approximately  officers and explosive detection dogs. Our assessment is that this group is concealing bomb making materials. We have a number of areas of focus but there is nothing definitive and no guarantees. However, our chances of success are vastly improved by support and information from the community.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

that latter section of the A, to open in . Those two schemes cost £ million.They are two of three major improvements on the main route to the Northwest.The third dual carriageway is the longest, a -mile stretch that is being built from Dungiven to Drumahoe, on the outskirts of the Maiden City.When all three parts are open in , almost  of the -mile journey between York Street, Belfast, and Altnagelvin, will be motorway or high quality dual carriageway. The latter road prohibits right turns across the central reserve, akin to a motorway.The upgrades will leave an -mile single carriageway over the Glenshane Pass, but it has lower traffic levels and climbing lanes.Gareth McLaverty, contracts manager at Graham, who built the road with Farrans, said they were “delighted” to finishthe first phase.He said: “It will help to strengthen the links between Belfast and Derry Londonderry and will bring the long-term benefits to road users and the local community of reduced journey times and improved road safety.”The road was delayed by environmental objections. Mr McLaverty said: “We have done our utmost to limit the environmental impact. An acoustic barrier, re-grading of agricultural land to reduce the impact of embankments, sustainable drainage ponds, farm accommodation tracks, over-bridges and underpasses, landscaping planting and boundary treatment are among the work carried out.”Video: Julian Smith issues Magee growth report - Department has not explored University for Derry Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC Four across the UK at the same time.try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three,

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It wasnrsquot le-ruining, but it always felt a little wrong. -- vw,vw,px, px\"PA general news reporter Jess Glass  --I accepted that everyone felt like this, that being an adult meant existing with a mild sense of crawling discomfort under your skin each time someone addressed you. Eventually, I figured out that is not quite true.I first realised I was non-binary after talking with a trans friend about their identity a few years ago. To identy as something, you need to know that it exists and I had been pretty ignorant of the whole LGBT community prior to going to university.I spent months thinking about it before mentioning being trans to my closest friends, and it was even longer before I tentatively started introducing myself with they pronouns and began asking close friends to use they and them for me.Deciding to use they pronouns was of a leap into the dark. As I had only recently realised that I was trans, there was a fear that somehow I was lying to myself, and that my identity was a sham. However, the more people who started calling me they, the more I realised how right it felt, and how finally I had found a way of being seen by others which matched with the way I saw myself.Having those four letters attached to my identity was a simple way to be recognised and it gave me an answer to something I did not know I was missing.A lot of people in my le took time to adjust. Many friends found it hard to separate my still quite feminine presentation from my gender identity. But I know theyrsquore trying, and for me a sincere attempt is good enough.Being non-binary does not mean I cannot enjoy dresses and make-up, because they are not exclusively for women. Those things are for everyone, just as Sam Smith can wear suits without their gender being questioned.It was a gradual process with my grandmother, who went from refusing to learn what a pronoun is to mostly getting things right.Today is a good day so here goes. Irsquove decided I am changing my pronouns to THEY THEM # after a letime of being at war with my gender Irsquove decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and outhellip pic IVoLTYbAWdmdash Sam SmithSeptember , Being fundamentally recognised by those closest to me brought more joy than I realised was possible, as did coming out professionally. Even now, a colleague casually using ldquothey for me is quite emotional.Sam Smith and thousands of other non-binary people are out in a society which struggles to accept all trans people, where we are taught about a strict gender binary even as children.Having they pronouns listed in my Twitter bio adds a transphobic twist to the abuse I receive on the , combined with jokes about identying as an attack helicopter, or grammatical arguments about the use of they as a singular.Sometimes questions are made in good faith, from people who simply do not know about trans issues but want to respect people for who they are.The voices of those who intentionally use pronouns as a way of hurting people are often louder than those who support them, and there will be a lot of people who simply refuse to understand.But I cannot help but hope that Sam Smith publicly using they pronouns will bring more of these good faith questions to light and in turn produce more allies to the whole LGBT community.For me at least, being my authentic self is worth the backlash and I really hope they feel the same..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sam Smith news gives hope to non-binary community article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
