(Picture: Cavendish)Fancy seeing the world via five-star luxury in Mexico, Bali and St Tropez?Why not be like Gweneth Lee, 47, and make your way from (five star) resort to (five star) resort by bedding unfaithful married men.She calculates her boyfriends have spent £100,000 in total funding her holidays, and she’s now hoping for more to add to her harem.‘Why pay for an expensive foreign holiday when you can get your lover to do so? That sums up my attitude,’ she said. ‘I’ve been doing more air miles than Richard Branson and loving every minute of it over the last year.’‘I worked out that I had travelled more than 50,000 miles for various liaisons with my lovers. I managed to join the Mile High Club on a private jet with one of my regulars – a wealthy shipping magnate.’She’s looking forward to more trips with married men this summer (Picture: Cavendish)‘But most of the time I travel on my own and link up with them at the hotel because they are meeting me in secret when they away on business trips.‘They will be in Silicon Valley near San Francisco on a work outing and they will jump on a quick flight and join me in Las Vegas. Or they will be meeting business contacts in Paris and then join me by the Mediterranean for a long weekend.‘I had one lover who insisted I shadowed the holiday he was having with his wife and children at Martha’s Vineyard near New York. So I stayed in a hotel ten miles down the road for the second week of their stay. He nipped over to my hotel for sex three days running by explaining that he was going on fishing trips.’Living the dream, eh?Gweneth on a luxury yacht in St Tropez (Picture: Cavendish)She insists on flying first class, naturally, funded by her BFs who include a jeweller, a stockbroker and a technology investor.Now 47-year old Miss Lee of Chelsea, West London is looking forward to packed summer of free trips on some of Europe’s finest beaches with other married men.‘I’m off to Marbella next month with an industrialist and then I’m going to Croatia with a gorgeous married man who owns health clubs.’Business consultant Miss Lee meets all her lovers through IllicitEncounters.com, a dating website for married people.She joined the site a decade ago after the death of her oil executive husband Robert and has had more than 100 affairs with married men since then.And one having cocktails in St Tropez (Picture: Cavendish)Spokesman Christian Grant claims Gweneth is ‘typical’ of many glamorous female members on the site.‘We find the spring and summer are among the busiest times of the year,’ he insists.‘There is nothing like a long holiday to make you realise you married the wrong person.‘That is when people come on to our site – looking for someone more exciting to enjoy the sunshine with.’Miss Lee said: ‘This was last June last year. I have been seeing a fabulously wealthy jeweller who has clients in all of Europe’s fashion capitals – Milan, Paris, London. He was on business in Paris and insisted I join him on the French Riviera which only is only an hour away from the capital by plane.‘We stayed on his private yacht – it was absolutely incredible. He had a staff of 20 people ready to cater for our every whim. He is married and loves his wife but she can’t keep up with him sexually and he really does have a girl in every port – he is insatiable!’Miss Lee said: ‘My lover has made a fortune investing in tech start-ups based in Silicon Valley around San Francisco. He was an early investor in Facebook, Uber and lots of other household names.‘He lives with his wife in London but spends a lot of time on the American West Coast. He was there for two weeks and insisted I join him in Vegas for a long weekend.‘He is a gambler so there was a lot time spent watching him playing the tables. It was a lot of fun. We stayed at the Wynn – the best hotel in Vegas.’Miss Lee said: ‘My lover made the mistake of marrying his teenage sweetheart. He’d got to his 40s and realised he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life sleeping with only one woman. I am one of several women he sees.‘He was in Hong Kong for business and asked me to join him in Bali on his way home. It was a long way to go but he made it worthwhile. We stayed at the Bulgari Resort which has to be seen to be believed.’Miss Lee said: ‘This was my most recent trip and was probably the best. We stayed at the Casa Malca – one of the finest hotels in the world. My lover was on a business trip to Wall Street in New York and joined me for a long weekend.‘He is devoted to his wife but she has gone off sex – that’s where I come in!’MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look happy and relaxed as the one month countdown to the royal wedding beginsMORE: New British blue passports will be made in France after firm drops appeal"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/date1.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"basics impressing woman first date","story":"(Picture: Getty Ella Byworth)First dates are mysterious terrain to lots of men, unless you’re James Bond.Where do you take her on a first date? What can you talk about to ensure that there are no awkward, staring-at-the-menu silences? And most importantly, how can you impress her enough to get a second date?It can feel like a complete gamble. But don’t panic – here are some stressbusting tips to help you make sure everything goes smoothly.We know, you want to be romantic and original. You don’t want to take her to a boring bar or restaurant, so you’re thinking of a mid-day picnic in the park. Perhaps a hike to a place you’ve never been before? Ice-cream on a rollercoaster?The whole point of first dates is that you’re getting to know a stranger – you have absolutely no idea what they like. At this point, you don’t want to suggest a quirky, offbeat date that they might not enjoy (besides, ants crawling all over the two of you on a blistering July day in the park is not exactly conducive to romance).No, no, there’s a reason the classics are classics.Take her to a restaurant and just talk. Order your signature drink, ask her if she wants to split a starter. Once you know her likes and dislikes better, you’re free to plan inventive dates.First dates can feel like a job interview, in the sense that you’re both trying to see if you’re a good match. You want to skillfully highlight your time spent doing charity work in Uruguay, your extensive knowledge of Russian literature, or your piano-playing ability.But that doesn’t exactly put people in the mood for romance. Take off your interview hat and relax, so you can put her at ease.Instead of talking, listen. Ask her simple questions: ‘What’s a typical weekend like for you? Ah, do you enjoy that? That must be difficult – tell me more?’Good listeners are rare enough to be impressive.Above all else, she wants to feel that you take an interest in her, and that she’s an interesting person. If you spend the entirety of the date lecturing her on all the wonderful things about yourself, she’s going to go home bored out of her skull – no matter how varied your CV is or how funny you try to be.Sure, that’s not how you’ve seen it on TV and movies. Onscreen, first dates are filled with sexy innuendo and knock-em-dead lines. But this can easily backfire, or come off cheesy, or (worst of all) leave her feeling uncomfortable – the kind of uncomfortable where she calls for the bill and texts her friends saying: ‘Oh god, complete disaster. He was being creepy and overtly sexual the entire night.’When in doubt, keep it subtle. Maybe lay off that filthy joke you heard around the office last Friday. Don’t go straight to the pick-up line you read in some men’s Internet forum.Do compliment her: ‘You look beautiful in that dress.’ A tasteful compliment does the heavy lifting –it lets her know that you’re attracted to her, without being OTT. Remember, you can always flirt outrageously later when you know more about her preferences.It’s natural to be curious about the other person’s relationship history, or their current status. You want to swap horror stories of online dating, or talk about dealbreakers. You might both be thinking: ‘Heshe is so great, why are they single?’All of that is fine. With one notable exception: Do not talk at length about your exes. There’s just no reason to do it on the first date, no matter what. Even if you thought they were ‘crazy’ because they keyed your car.Don’t talk about why you broke up with them, or do a post-mortem of that relationship. Don’t point out that your ex’s favourite band is playing in the bar. Don’t talk about them, period. This is a date between two people, not a therapy session with the ghost of your ex in attendance.Keep the ex references to zero – and if that’s tough, question why. If you can’t go on a date without bringing up Jenny who you loved four years ago…maybe you shouldn’t be dating.Okay, let’s skip ahead to the final five minutes of the evening. You’ve split the check after she refused to let you pay, you’re walking her to her car, and you feel so tense you can’t move. What do you do? Do you kiss her? Do you say goodbye? Do you do the stiff one-arm hug before disappearing?Relax. Watch her cues. If you’ve been flirting heavily for hours, it might be the propitious moment to lean in slightly and say ‘I’ve been thinking about kissing you the whole night.’Whatever you do, don’t lunge – it’s hugely offputting.If a kiss happens organically, fantastic. If not, don’t stress it. Handle any rejection with grace. It might not be the right time. Maybe it’ll happen on the second date, when you finally go on that picnic in the park.This is your chance to be polite and sweet. Tell her that you had a lovely time, and ask her to text you when she gets home safe. That way, she’s much more likely to say ‘Yes please’ when you text ‘Can we do this again?’MORE: How to avoid unintentionally being a d*ck to women in the street at nightMORE: How to compliment a woman without being a creepMORE: A guide to birdnesting, the hot new orce trend"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/florida-fly-drive-main.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"dale wintons final tv appearance saw explore disneyland florida fly drive","story":"Dale Winton’s final ever TV appearance saw him explore Disneyland on Channel 5’s Florida Fly Drive, which aired two months before his death.The Supermarket Sweep presenter died aged 62 yesterday (April 18) with the cause of death yet to be confirmed.His agent Jan Kennedy confirmed the star passed away in a statement, saying: ‘It is with great sadness that we can confirm the passing of Dale Winton who died at home earlier today.Dale Winton visited Disney in his last TV appearance (Picture: Channel 5)‘While we know many will share this terrible loss, we ask that you respect the family’s privacy at this time of grief.’While Winton was beloved for hosting Supermarket Sweep throughout the 1990s, his last TV appearance was on Channel 5’s travel documentary Florida Fly Drive.\u0027The one thing he wanted was a boyfriend\u0027: Dale Winton\u0027s love life was \u0027turbulent\u0027Florida Drive By is expected to return in June (Picture: FarmGroup.TV)The final four episodes are expected to be released in June, with Channel 5 yet to confirm whether this will change in light of his death.His final appearance was a trip around Disneyland Florida, seeing him meet Mickey Mouse and ride the teacups 10 years after his first visit with his godchildren.Dale Winton even threw it back to his Supermarket Sweep days on the show (Picture: Channel 5)The presenter is also known for hosting shows like In It To Win It and Hole In The Wall.Following news of his death, tributes have since poured in for Winton from the likes of Rylan Clark-Neal, Davina McCall and Piers Morgan.MORE: Dale Winton’s heartbreaking early years: Star’s ‘one regret’ was not coming out to his mother before her deathMORE: David Walliams ‘heartbroken’ over death of Dale Winton who he helped through depression"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/610794096-e1523542866250.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"dogs really do resemble their owners but not in the way youd expect","story":"Who wouldn’t want to look like this cute doggo?

He added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’Victim statements from the second man said he had been left in dire financial straits, had to take out pay day loans and spent some inheritance from his grandfather on his debts.He added: ‘I feel I can’t trust anyone and I’m paranoid I will be taken advantage of.Plastic straws and cotton buds could be banned to cut plastic pollution‘He had no right to take advantage of my good nature the way he did.

He had to out himself.’The victim said in a statement he was ‘frightened and terrified’ during the ordeal and added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’The court heard the second gay victim was convinced Bain was ‘also homosexual’ and initially freely handed over loans as their friendship grew, in the belief they would be paid back.As Bain’s requests for cash started to increase, he said he had a sick son and that they ‘needed money to travel to Scotland’, which made the victim feel sorry for him.The court heard when victim started to become reluctant to hand over more cash, Bain changed tactics.Mr Giuliani said: ‘He became more openly threatening, saying if he didn’t hand over money a gang called the Conroys could come calling for looking for him and smash up his home and car, saying he knew where his family lived and they would be hurt.’Bain even penned a letter, claiming to be ‘contract’ from one of the ‘Conroys’, saying money had to be handed over by 2pm as a ‘guarantee to be the end’.By the end of the man’s ordeal, Bain had pocketed £15,797.The court heard the victim’s credit score was badly effected by him having to find large cash sums and take out taking out high interest pay day loans.Bain, of Gateshead who has no fixed address, admitted two charges of blackmail as well as fraud and theft in relation to the second man.Bain also pleaded guilty to a fraud charge after taking £295 from a disabled man’s account, who had handed over a cash card in exchange for having his windows cleaned.Judge Simon Batiste sentenced Bain to six years behind bars and said his behaviour was ‘wicked’.The judge said: ‘Eventually, one man, went inside and told his family what was happening and the fact he was gay.‘As a result of this offence he, in fact, had to out himself to his family.’Rachel Hedworth, defending, said Bain has a long term drug habit, which is at the root of his long criminal record, and is ‘extremely remorseful’ for his actions.Miss Hedworth said Bain ‘pretended he was also homosexual’ and added: ‘He, in fact, led both of these men on to believe something would happen, that he would embark on a relationship with both of them in the first instance.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-455259480.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"rafael reveals bust louis van gaal led manchester united exit","story":"Louis van Gaal ended Rafael’s career at Manchester United.

That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged.

Pictured above, Meghan and Prince Harry earlier this year But although King concluded the 2013 interview with the actress by joking about Silverstein \u0027missing out\u0027 on Meghan, he says he doesn\u0027t feel like he\u0027s missed out on anything.Now happily married to photographer Cynthia, 36, and father to two daughters, Ami, 10, and Laila, five, he said: \u0027Meghan\u0027s wonderful and I think she\u0027s a fantastic person and a very strong person but I\u0027m very happy with my wife, who I think is perfect for me.\u0027He would still love an invitation to the wedding next month (\u0027I love a wedding!\u0027) and cheekily suggests he would be more than enough to balance out the phalanx of ex-girlfriends Harry, 33, is said to be inviting.But the main thing, he says, is that Meghan gets to be happy. \u0027I think Meghan will be a very empathetic princess,\u0027 said Silverstein. \u0027I think she\u0027ll be a compassionate princess and I think she\u0027ll be one who pays attention.\u0027I think this is very the stars lining up, that\u0027s how it feels, which is pretty cool.\u0027But as far as someone that I\u0027ve dated, from my past, meeting someone and falling in love with them, I don\u0027t think it matters that he\u0027s a prince – I think it matters that they\u0027re happy and in love together.\u0027Jokingly, beatbox artist Silverstein, who regularly appears on The Late Late Show with James Corden, added: \u0027Meghan, if you\u0027re watching this, call me!\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/10/4B461A4C00000578-5628921-The_puzzle_includes_64_fiendishly_tough_clues_that_are_virtually-m-86_1524042404197.jpg","title":"Cryptic crossword hardest fans two years crack","story":"    Marc Breman, 56, believes his cryptic creation will leave the most hardcore crossword fans feeling extremely down and cross  The puzzle includes 64 \u0027fiendishly tough\u0027 clues that are virtually impossible for a layman to crack.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics   The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia.

CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t.

But what is GDPR?What is GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for ‘free’ services.GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.Why do we need GDPR?  The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when iniduals wanted to know how their information was being used.  GDPR was planned because of the EU’s need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.          The General Data Protection Regulation will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member statesWhen will the GDPR be implemented?The GDPR  will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.Who does the GDPR apply to?GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.What is personal data?Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an inidual.Iniduals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.          The European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other identifiersHow much are GDPR fines?When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or €10 million (£8.7m), whichever is higher.Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.If people’s rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to €20 million (£17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.Does Brexit affect GDPR?With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time. In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit. The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to £17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.Maniac: Everything

corgis","story":"The Queen was hit especially hard by the death of her last Welsh corgi Willow (who appeared in the Olympic opening ceremony with Daniel Craig), that had to be put to sleep at Windsor after suffering from cancer and other related illnessesLike all 30 of the corgis she has owned — and other royal pets including gundogs, labradors and cocker iels — Willow\u0027s time as part of the Queen\u0027s menagerie will be recorded in the traditional manner.It has been like this since 1959 when the death of Susan, the Queen\u0027s first corgi, given to her as a puppy on her 18th birthday by her father King George VI, was marked with a headstone.On it are engraved the dog\u0027s dates of birth and death along with the moving epitaph: \u0027For almost 15 years the faithful companion of the Queen.\u0027The same words appear on the gravestones of two of Susan\u0027s descendants, Sugar and Heather. And, because Willow is the last of the line, the 14th generation traced back to Susan, the elegy is likely to be just as heartfelt.There is only one unwritten rule — wherever possible, the animals are buried where they died, which means the final resting place of generations of the Royal Family\u0027s pets can be found at Windsor, Balmoral and Sandringham.These pet cemeteries have one thing in common: they are all in a secluded and peaceful spot with special resonance for the Queen.Willow is believed to have been interred close to Frogmore House, the royal retreat in Windsor Great Park where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will celebrate their wedding with a party on May 19.Other corgis have been buried closer to Windsor Castle, but Frogmore is where the Queen likes to walk, often with her dogs, far from any public access.          The death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in SurreyBy far the largest animal cemetery is at Sandringham, in a tidy corner of the 20,000-acre estate, but within view of the royal residence.It was started by Queen Victoria for her collie Noble, who died in 1887, and it is where Susan was buried more than 70 years later.There are also memorial plaques set into a stone boundary wall that separates the cemetery from the rest of the estate.One commemorates Candy, Prince Philip\u0027s yellow labrador, who died in 1958. Another bears the name Sandringham Slipper, a black labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as a royal pet.Sandringham Brae, another black lab, is described as \u0027a gentleman amongst dogs\u0027 on his stone, while a roan cocker iel called Sandringham Fern is celebrated as a \u0027tireless worker and mischievous character\u0027.When Holly, the Queen\u0027s penultimate corgi, died at Balmoral 18 months ago, she directed that he must be buried in sight of the castle\u0027s drawing room windows.\u0027Even when they are no longer with her, the Queen likes to feel she is still surrounded by her corgis,\u0027 says a friend. \u0027That is why they are buried at all of her main private homes. They have been such a huge part of her life.\u0027The Queen is not, of course, without four-legged companionship now she still has her two dorgis — corgi-dachshund crosses Candy and Vulcan — along with a new addition to her canine family, Whisper, a corgi who used to be owned by a Sandringham gamekeeper.But the death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in Surrey.In her 1983 biography of the Queen, Elizabeth R, the Countess of Longford wrote: \u00271933 was the year of the corgi.\u0027          At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats          Princess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of BathPrincess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of Bath.The breed was little known outside South Wales, but the young princess and her sister Margaret pleaded with their parents for one of their own.The Duke and Duchess of York needed little persuading and Mrs Thelma Gray, breeder of the Weymouths\u0027 dog and a pioneer of the breed, supplied the first royal corgi, Rozavel Golden Eagle — or Dookie, so-called by Mrs Gray because, she claimed, he acted \u0027aristocratically\u0027.Three years later Dookie acquired a wife called Jane but this royal marriage of convenience proved unproductive.Jane did produce two puppies with another mate, however, and Crackers and Carol joined King George and Queen Elizabeth\u0027s household during World War II.In 1944, Susan arrived as Princess Elizabeth\u0027s birthday present. Mistress and pet were inseparable. She even accompanied the Princess on her honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947, hidden from view under a blanket in the royal carriage.The following year, when the Princess gave birth to her first baby, Charles, newspaper columns were full of advice on how she could prevent Susan from becoming jealous of the infant prince.A year later, Susan followed her royal mistress into motherhood, producing a pair of puppies: Sugar, who belonged to Prince Charles, and Honey who, in later years, lived with the Queen Mother. It marked the beginning of a new royal dynasty.Over the years, the Queen became one of the most experienced breeders of Pembrokeshire corgis in the country. She always chose the sire herself, aiming for good-looking puppies that maintain the red colouring of the original Pembrokes.At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats.Every few years, a fresh litter arrived and older dogs passed away. No puppies were ever sold instead the Queen ensured that they went to good homes. Susan\u0027s descendants have gone to Australia and America.Then came the dorgis, a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between one of the Queen\u0027s corgis and Princess Margaret\u0027s dachshund Pipkin.In 2009, it emerged that the Queen had stopped breeding the dogs. It was perhaps the first public sign that our monarch was growing old.She worried about puppies and lively young dogs around her feet, and the fear that she might trip over, hurting herself or them. But what was not clear then was that she no longer wanted any new four-legged companions to replace those that died.Then, three years ago Monty Roberts, the Californian cowboy who inspired the Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer, disclosed what many had suspected: the Queen, who will be 92 on Saturday, did not wish to leave any of her beloved pets after her death. Corgis have an average life of 12 to 13 years, though some can reach 18. Willow was just a few weeks short of her 15th birthday.Inevitably, perhaps, it took a plain-speaking American to give this first intimation of the Queen\u0027s sense of her own mortality.Roberts — after whom the Queen named Monty, one of the corgis that appeared in the James Bond spoof she made with actor Daniel Craig for the London Olympics — was an informal adviser to her on horses and dogs for more than 25 years.He said that when Monty died in 2012, he offered to find the Queen a replacement puppy. \u0027But she didn\u0027t want to have any more young dogs. She didn\u0027t want to leave any young dog behind. I understood we would discuss it further at a later date.\u0027Well, we never did, and I have no right to try to force her into continuing to bring on young puppies if she doesn\u0027t want to.\u0027          Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the tableFor now, life for Candy, Vulcan and Whisper will continue as usual. Each day starts with a brisk walk with a footman in the Buckingham Palace gardens and, because of their age, they are relatively easy to handle. The days when former royal butler Paul Burrell, then a Palace page, was knocked unconscious when nine leashed corgis pulled him over on the steps of Sandringham House are long past.When their mistress is at the Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a boot room near the royal apartments, through which they are at liberty to wander.Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the table.Whenever possible, the Queen feeds the corgis herself — their menu includes steak, poached chicken, liver and rabbit.According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years in the Palace kitchen, the corgis had a \u0027wonderful diet. One day it might be chuck steak, boiled and diced and served with finely chopped boiled cabbage and white rice. The next they\u0027d have poached chicken or liver. Or rabbits shot by William and Harry which we\u0027d clean and cook\u0027.Kate and Wills WON\u0027T know if they are having a boy or a girl...South Korean kills and COOKS his neighbour\u0027s dog then...Kate Middleton and Prince William launch Royal Baby webpage In over his head! Adorable video shows a Corgi hopping...Share this article    The Queen is pictured Wednesday during the unveiling of a panel marking the walkway in Buckingham Palace gardens in relation to the Commonwealth Walkway project in LondonThe Queen likes to take them on a daily constitutional which also serves as a kind of meditation. Prince Philip has referred to this as her \u0027dog mechanism\u0027 therapy.And she is very hands-on with their personal maintenance, de-fleaing them and administering medicine. Nothing is too much trouble. When she is being fitted for a new dress, the Queen produces a special magnet to pick up pins to ensure the dogs do not prick their paws.No world figure has been as identified with an animal as the Queen has with her corgis.Over the years they have brought a warmth to her public image, being photographed at her side receiving statesmen in formal situations, or on a tartan picnic rug with the Royal Family at Balmoral, or being bundled by a flunky up the steps on to a royal plane.In a life governed by protocol, they are also a simple way to break the ice with strangers. The line may now have ended, but Willow, like each and every one of her corgis, will be remembered.Reacting to news of Willow\u0027s death yesterday one royal fan, Angela Cox, recalled visiting Sandringham just after the Queen had been there.In a tweet she said: \u0027There was a small posy on each of her dogs\u0027 graves. It made me cry.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/22/4B4B223C00000578-5631741-image-a-13_1524086711879.jpg","title":"Is Britains magnificent magnolia picture better one win 500","story":"    This magnificent magnolia was photographed in Kew Garden in London earlier today as temperatures soared           To enter the competition you need to be a UK resident aged 18 or over and have taken the photograph this yearWhile some blossoms are now at their best and others are still to thrill, Radio 4’s John Humphrys remarked sadly yesterday that all the petals on the specimen in his London garden have already dropped. Despite becoming a fixture in Britain, the trees have strong French ties, having been named in the 18th century after botanist Pierre Magnol.

He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out ‘hello loves, hello darlings!’ I asked why he was saying hello. He replied ‘always wave at policemen David. You never know when you might need one!’ Winton was a household name in the mid 1990s and early 2000s while fronting shows like Supermarket Sweep and The National Lottery: In It To Win It, but had kept a low profile in recent years.   He was born in Marylebone,London, in May 1955 to Gary and Sheree, an actress.Writing in his autobiography, Dale Winton: My Story, in 2002, the much loved star touchingly described his relationship with his beloved mother.\u0027In truth though, I always felt my Mum would forgive me anything. She believed in boundaries and was strict, but her love for me was real and unconditional.\u0027          David Walliams, who Dale counted among his closest friends, has given both tragic and hilarious insights into his life and personalityHis parents orced when he was 10 and his father died three years later on the day of Winton\u0027s bar mitzvah.Just days after he turned 21, Winton discovered his mother, who he adored, had died after taking an overdose of prescription medication.Distraught, Winton never fully got over the loss of his beloved mother and soon after her death sough help from the Samaritans. \u0027I had some really desperate personal moments soon after Mum died,\u0027 he said in his autobiography. \u0027On one occasion, I telephoned the Samaritans and went to see one of their volunteers. \u0027Whatever people say to comfort one, suicide is chiefly thought of as the ultimate rejection of loved ones, as well as of life, and those who are left need time to get beyond these thoughts His career in showbusiness began when he worked as a DJ on the London club scene before he moved into work in radio and television.His big break came with Supermarket Sweep, which saw contestants racing around a supermarket collecting items.He hosted the show from 1993 to 2001, and was involved in a 2007 reboot.From there, Winton moved onto prime-time shows including The National Lottery\u0027s In It To Win It and went onto host his own Christmas specials as well as celebrity guest shows.           Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive - Ep 4 - Dale and biker Carl at a Harley Davidson biker rally before Dale has a ride on the Harley - it would be one of the very last shows he would ever make  Pals: Davina, pictured with the late star in 1998, counted herself among his many showbiz palsCCTV shows thieves moments before breaking into old lady\u0027s houseShocking moment \u0027drink driver\u0027 careers into oncoming vehiclePrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthAnt McPartlin arrives at Wimbledon Magistrates\u0027 Court for hearingMotorist attempts to destroy bus lane camera and then fights erAstounding moment man rides motorbike across surface of Lake ComoHilarious moment two men have \u0027handbags\u0027 fight on roadsidePolice threaten to crush vehicles of those caught \u0027hare coursing\u0027Investigation claims Iceland leave chilled food out too longTheresa May apologies for anxiety caused over Windrush scandalAir traffic control audio from Southwest Airlines flight 1380    Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive - Dale with Chip and Dale in Walt Disney\u0027s Animal Kingdom.

Bob Menendez, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, scolded Pompeo for not being forthright with him even in their private talks about his Easter weekend tete-a-tete with Kim. \u0027After committing to transparency in his opening statement, he was not forthcoming when I questioned him about his involvement in the Russia investigation and I can tell you even his private conversations with me he didn\u0027t tell me about his visit to North Korea,\u0027 Menendez said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event in Washington. The president confirmed Tuesday that a face-to-face meeting between himself and Kim was still on track to take place in the next few weeks.\u0027I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un. And hopefully that will be a success. And maybe it will be, and maybe it won\u0027t be. We don\u0027t know,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But I can say this: They do respect us. We are respectful of them.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK. It\u0027s also now a 65 shot that despite its sodden start, this April takes home the accolade as being the warmest ever. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u0027The gorgeous weather has got us feeling flush and we\u0027ve been forced to slash the odds of the sunshine sticking around. \u0027Bosses ought to expect workers to be pulling sickies left, right and center this week as the mercury rises.\u0027 Supermarket chiefs are stockpiling beer, cider and sun cream as the min-heatwave sweeps in.Sainsbury\u0027s predict a 300 per cent rise in demand for sun cream and a 100 per cent increase in sales of fake tan over the next couple of days – so punters can look ready-bronzed in the sunshine.They also estimate 70 per cent more sales of beer and cider, a 30 per cent uplift in Rosé wine and a 150 per cent increase in demand for ice cream.And as the BBQ gets dusted down for the first time this year, the supermarket believes sales of vegan and vegetarian food will soar by 130 per cent.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027It seems the whole country has been eagerly awaiting the warmer weather, and we\u0027re expecting our customers to celebrate the return of sunshine by bronzing with fake tan, cooling down with ice cream and firing up the barbecue.\u0027 The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 68F-70F (20C-21C)  expected in Newcastle, 64F-66F (18C-19C) in Northern Ireland and 63F (17C) in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027But by mid-afternoon there will be lots of unbroken sunshine.\u0027Thursday could see even higher temperatures - 77-80F  (25C-27C) in the South East - as warm air continues to come up through Spain and on to the UK.Saturday could see isolated showers in parts, while there is \u0027uncertainty\u0027 about what Sunday\u0027s weather will bring.Experts predict these warm conditions are likely to last for the rest of the month, with changeable conditions continuing in the northwest, while the southeast still has some decent dry and bright spells.Toasty temperatures will even be higher than those in Malibu, Athens and Rome. The start of the week should see warm weather in the south and the east, but the north and west have a high risk of rain and wind.The southeast can expect the best conditions in the country with the northwest seeing the bleakest.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 77F (25C). A Spanish plume is caused by cool Atlantic air being pushed towards Spain, which in turn pushes warm Spanish air towards the UK, bringing with it hot humid weather.   Get ready for two weeks of sun!

Jennifer Riordan, 43, who died on a Southwest jet after its engine blew at 32,500 feet was killed by blunt impact trauma of head, neck and torso, according to the coroner \u0027Live can be a powerful tool in connecting and supporting communities during moments of crisis,\u0027 Simo said in a post.Since 2016, the average number of daily Facebook Live broadcasts has doubled year over year, with 3.5 billion live broadcasts since then.Martinez explained on Wednesday why he opened his laptop and fumbled for his credit card to pay $8 for Wi-Fi while other passengers were grabbing oxygen masks.\u0027All I could think of in that moment was, I need to communicate with my loved ones,\u0027 he said on ABC television. \u0027I thought, \u0027These are my last few moments on Earth and I want people to know what happened.\u0027\u0027Some social media users questioned his motives.\u0027I didn\u0027t see you say anything to the people you love,\u0027 said Lakeya Collins on Facebook. \u0027This social media world today is sickening Everyone wants to go viral ugggh.\u0027Other users said he provided important images.\u0027God forbid the outcome had been different, surely friends and family of those you captured would have at least had closure knowing the exact truth,\u0027 said Klaudia Olszowka.           Workers recovered the piece of metal carefully with gloves on and will hand it over to investigatorsSocial media watchers said Martinez\u0027s actions might be morally offensive to some but did not appear to violate Facebook\u0027s \u0027community standards,\u0027 which include bans on certain graphic or violent content, or that which is deemed disrespectful.Heidi Julien, a professor of information studies at University at Buffalo, New York, said it was inevitable people would use technology to show such events. Some of the negative responses to Martinez\u0027s videos - with dozens of users picking fault with how he wore his oxygen mask - showed a desensitization to what people saw live.\u0027This is not online television, this is people\u0027s real lives,\u0027 Julien said.            Investigators have not yet determined what caused the explosion but they do know that one of the engine\u0027s fan blades had come loose as the result of metal fatigue"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/08/05EA31B9000003E8-0-image-m-11_1524121343754.jpg","title":"Experts deemed John Worboys fit release blast public backlash","story":"    The decision by the Parole Board that John Worboys (pictured) was safe for release sparked a public backlashTwo experts who gave evidence that almost led to the release of black cab rapist John Worboys say the public backlash against them was wrong.The psychologists were slammed by the High Court at a hearing last month for failing to probe if the the serial sex attacker was being \u0027open and honest.\u0027In a letter in The Psychologist journal, the pair, who have not been named, hit out at the public approaching the case in a \u0027common sense fashion.\u0027They claimed that \u0027sometimes common sense let us down\u0027 and hinted Worboys posed less risk because he had repeatedly denied his guilt.In the letter, The Sun reports, they cited a 2015 study of 7,000 sex offenders in the UK, which showed that \u0027those who took full responsibility for their offence sexually re-offended at a significantly higher rate than those who took partial or no responsibility for their offence.\u0027The decision by the Parole Board in January that he was safe to walk free, sparked a huge backlash. Worboys, 60, was convicted of attacks on 12 women at his 2009 trial after \u0027sample\u0027 charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick was then forced to quit.   Justice Secretary David Gauke (left) has admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board\u0027s decision, which eventually saw its chairman Nick Hardwick (right) forced to resign when the ruling was overturned The Crown Prosecution Service  is facing mounting pressure to review the decision not to charge Worboys in connection with some of the 83 cases that police passed files to them on.A spokesman for the CPS said that every rape allegation which met the evidential test was prosecuted. No further charges have been brought forward and the CPS said ti would only review the cases should new evidence surface.  Two weeks ago Justice Secretary David Gauke admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board decision.He told the Sun on Sunday that he did not want the serial sex attacker to be released and that he was pleased the High Court challenge by two victims to overturn ruling was successful.He said: \u0027Clearly, things didn’t go as they should have gone. \u0027Look, I made the decision. I accept responsibility, so I’m not hiding behind my advisers. It’s my responsibility entirely.\u0027The Justice Secretary refused to block the parole board decision as outrage mounted and instead waited for victims to launch a legal challenge.He added: \u0027I felt it ­sensible to take advice from a top barrister and I interrogated that advice and concluded it was right I don’t take the action.\u0027I was pleased it was successful and Worboys remains behind bars — I didn’t want Worboys released. My focus now is ensuring we learn the lessons from the case.\u0027Mr Gauke has also faced calls to join parole board chair Professor Nick Hardwick in quitting his position after the U-turn was finalised.    John Worboys experts blast public backlash against them after deeming the rapist fit for release"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/15/4B47FBD400000578-0-image-a-5_1524060341087.jpg","title":"Pictured Hero ex Navy pilot Southwest Airlines flight hugs traumatized passengers","story":"    Pilot Tammie Jo Shults is pictured hugging passengers after making an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday after one of the engines on the Southwest Airlines jet she was flying exploded and a passenger was partially sucked out of a shattered window  Pilot Shults, a former Navy pilot, was calm as she called air traffic control to tell them she was making an emergency landing.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK. It\u0027s also now a 65 shot that despite its sodden start, this April takes home the accolade as being the warmest ever. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u0027The gorgeous weather has got us feeling flush and we\u0027ve been forced to slash the odds of the sunshine sticking around. \u0027Bosses ought to expect workers to be pulling sickies left, right and center this week as the mercury rises.\u0027 Supermarket chiefs are stockpiling beer, cider and sun cream as the min-heatwave sweeps in.Sainsbury\u0027s predict a 300 per cent rise in demand for sun cream and a 100 per cent increase in sales of fake tan over the next couple of days – so punters can look ready-bronzed in the sunshine.They also estimate 70 per cent more sales of beer and cider, a 30 per cent uplift in Rosé wine and a 150 per cent increase in demand for ice cream.And as the BBQ gets dusted down for the first time this year, the supermarket believes sales of vegan and vegetarian food will soar by 130 per cent.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027It seems the whole country has been eagerly awaiting the warmer weather, and we\u0027re expecting our customers to celebrate the return of sunshine by bronzing with fake tan, cooling down with ice cream and firing up the barbecue.\u0027 The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 68F-70F (20C-21C)  expected in Newcastle, 64F-66F (18C-19C) in Northern Ireland and 63F (17C) in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027But by mid-afternoon there will be lots of unbroken sunshine.\u0027Thursday could see even higher temperatures - 77-80F  (25C-27C) in the South East - as warm air continues to come up through Spain and on to the UK.Saturday could see isolated showers in parts, while there is \u0027uncertainty\u0027 about what Sunday\u0027s weather will bring.Experts predict these warm conditions are likely to last for the rest of the month, with changeable conditions continuing in the northwest, while the southeast still has some decent dry and bright spells.Toasty temperatures will even be higher than those in Malibu, Athens and Rome. The start of the week should see warm weather in the south and the east, but the north and west have a high risk of rain and wind.The southeast can expect the best conditions in the country with the northwest seeing the bleakest.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 77F (25C). A Spanish plume is caused by cool Atlantic air being pushed towards Spain, which in turn pushes warm Spanish air towards the UK, bringing with it hot humid weather.   Get ready for two weeks of sun!

But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

The best memorial to all those who have lost their lives in Grenfell is that we as a nation choose collectively to invest in safe and secure public housing for all who need it.”This, Boughton’s first book, isn’t a reworking of the blog but an original work whose purpose is to argue passionately for that idea. For the past few years his writing has been an elegant and compendious ongoing exploration of Britain’s social history through its council estates. The book celebrates an era during which dreams of shelter and security for all – not just those who could afford to purchase it – were in large part made a reality, and asks us if we oughtn’t to consider reviving that dream before it gets destroyed completely.Britain’s first municipal housing, built at Vauxhall in north Liverpool in 1869, was established on the advice of Liverpool’s first medical officer William Duncan, who was among the first to establish a link between insanitary housing conditions and poor health. One third of the working-age population – 86,000 – – 86,000 people – were squashed into just over 2,000 cramped blocks, with a further 38,000 living in cellars. In Ancoats, central Manchester, a report by the physician John Thresh concluded that 3,000 to 4,000 people were “dying annually from remediable causes” – causes remedied, in other words, by decent housing.It took two world wars for local and central government to address slum clearance and to commission mass housing schemes which met the needs of growing cities. Quality and size went up and down according to whether Labour or the Tories were in government: Labour’s first years in power from 1924 were marked by improved minimum standards for council dwellings, which were reversed by the post-crash National government in the 1930s, leading to many pinched, uniform interwar flats.Nye Bevan famously instituted luxurious minimum standards for his postwar council houses, which averaged 1,055sq ft for a three-bedroomed house with a bathroom and separate lavatory. He condemned the interwar estates as “castrated communities” –the housing meant solely for working-class people who were taught they should be grateful for what they got – rather than council housing so good that anyone on any income would want to live in it. But Harold Macmillan, who became housing minister in 1951, built a larger number of smaller, cynically named “people’s houses”.One word Boughton keeps coming back to in his account of “the rise and fall of council housing” is “decency”. It can be used romantically, he acknowledges, as a kind way of overlooking how brutal living conditions can come to brutalise those who endure them. But it also sums up his view of what, and whom, council housing is for: a sense of societal decency and fairness, in which every member enjoys comfort and safety.Tories have always tended to see it as compensatory and temporary: you use it when you can’t buy your own, and only until you can buy your own. Historically, Labour tried to maintain a sense that council housing was for anyone who wanted it, a tenure as valid as ownership. We know which view has won out since the “right to buy” became law in 1980. The massive popularity of discounted home ownership among sitting tenants seemed to confirm the emerging neoliberal view that all anyone wants is inidual control over inidual goods.Yet the massive shift to private renting in the past decade – at best, unsatisfactory, at worst, dangerous – partly resulting from a diminished stock of council housing has brought more people into contact with the sharp end of housing insecurity and unaffordability. Housing has been rising steadily up the political agenda since the 2008 crash the causes and consequences of the Grenfell fire made that concern a matter of urgency.

But as the country’s 70th anniversary nears, the strain is showingBen-Gurion Boulevard climbs from the bustling port on Haifa’s Mediterranean shore up Mount Carmel towards the famous Bahai shrine, its gleaming golden dome surrounded by lush terraced gardens. On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts. “I prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,” says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. “Haifa’s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.” Yahav’s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri’s death in 1940. “I can promise you that this won’t happen if I die,” he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. “I can’t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.” No one questions that the city is special. “If all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I’d be happy,” muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. “It’s not lovey-dovey. Life is essentially segregated but every community accepts that you can do your own thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than everywhere else.” Asaf Ron, who runs the municipally funded Beit Ha’Gefen cultural centre, argues that it is all about promoting empathy. “Many Israeli Jews don’t know any Arabs. We need to break down stereotyping and fear.”Ayman Odeh, Israel’s most prominent Arab politician, lives in the Kababir neighbourhood, with its handsome mosque and stunning views over an azure sea. He also believes his home town is different. He served on the city council before being elected to the Knesset in 2015. “The situation between Jews and Arabs has always been better in Haifa than anywhere else in Israel, but it is far from equal,” he insists. “The mood is good and there is a sense of sanity. But it is not an island.” The local HQ of Odeh’s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state’s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (“Independence”) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (“Returnees to Zion”) and Kibbutz Galuyot (“the Ingathering of the Exiles”) streets. Zionism Avenue snakes across the Carmel to the downtown Arab quarter of Wadi Nisnas. Identity issues will be in the air in Haifa this month and next when Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and Palestinians mourn the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, that the 1948 war represented for them. “Arabs don’t take part in Independence Day celebrations,” says Yahav. “They don’t feel it is their holiday.” Johnny Mansour, a historian from the Greek Catholic community, will be joining a “march of return” to some of the hundreds of Arab villages destroyed after the war – the same symbolic commemoration that has triggered the recent deadly upsurge of violence on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fattoush, proudly flaunting its Palestinian nationalist credentials, will be closed to mark the occasion.Haifa once represented modernity and progress but feels less dynamic these days. In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a “Jewish national home” in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements. By 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor – unaware of military planning – urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as “absentee property”, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city’s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city’s courts, loom over the ruins. Haifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: “I remain in Haifa.” Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return. Haifa’s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav’s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim’s restaurant – jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza – in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 – saw anger flare. “In Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,” argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. “Haifa’s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.” Palestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 “green line” border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of“unrecognised” Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an “arson intifada” – though no one was ever charged. Haifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. “The Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority – the strong and the weak,” observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel’s Arab citizens – and has vocally condemned the army’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. “Coexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn’t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.” Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between “a rider and a horse”. And that, he insists, “is how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.”Education provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. “People want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,” says Asaf Ron. “Assimilation through attending the other community’s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.” The Yad beyad (“Hand in Hand”) private network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic – a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. “The whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,” says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser. Older Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards “colourful” natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli “apartheid and settler colonialism” – in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December. The closure of Haifa’s Arab theatre, al-Midan (“The Square”), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative – al-Khashabi (“The Stage”). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. “Independent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,” explains Al-Khashabi’s director, Bashar Murkus. “We believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.” His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the “c” word. “No one is shelling us here,” she adds. “It’s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It’s mind games.” Politician Ayman Odeh’s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel’s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. “Arabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,” warns Sikkuy’s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. “In Haifa it’s not hate, but there’s not too much love either,” is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to “take care” when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. “It’s pretty indifferent. We’ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd38f0a117aae7aa645b89b77a1fda91b3a8f4db/0_120_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ca076eca5849326a6f057b13dfebbe5 1240w","title":"aid fragile states david cameron","story":"In fragile states, resolving disputes and building institutions should take priority over a rush to hold electionsBut with nearly 900 million people still living on less than $2 a day, the battle against global poverty isn’t over. And, while growth in countries such as China and India is lifting millions out of poverty, in too many of the world’s poorest countries, progress is completely stuck.A great many of these countries – such as South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan – are what are called “fragile states”. Blighted by conflict and riven with corruption, their governments lack the capacity to deliver the most basic things: jobs, public services and security. Lacking in legitimacy, trying – and frequently failing – to serve deeply ided societies, their institutions struggle to win public support and respect.And their problems radiate around the world. After all, “state fragility” is often what causes migrants to risk everything to seek a better life. Terror training camps thrive in broken or lawless countries.What’s more, the problem is becoming more serious. Estimates suggest that by 2030, half of the world’s poor will live in fragile states. We need to be frank: the global goal to eradicate extreme poverty within the next 12 years will never be met unless this problem is addressed.That is why I put issues like sharing tax information and transparency about ownership at the top of the global agenda. The inability to collect taxes or to stop natural resources being stolen and hidden in rich countries – these are the things that stop people escaping the poverty trap.

We have probed issues that many policymakers have previously avoided. And today, the commission publishes its findings.They make for challenging reading. The sad fact is that some of these countries have had decades of aid yet remain as poor as they ever were – some poorer. We have to accept we have often ended up throwing good money after bad. But that is not a reason to stop aid it is a reason to change the way we do aid.The report calls for a new type of realism in the approach towards fragile states. For too long, expectations have been set too high. Instead, simple steps that bring jobs and security matter more than, for instance, setting new national targets for tackling inequality and climate change.It states that the countries concerned must be able to set their own priorities. Again, we have erred in the past. In an effort to help poor countries, donor governments and agencies have imposed priorities on them. However, the aim of international assistance should be to help fragile states to build legitimate and capable institutions, rather than endlessly undermine them with long lists of unachievable goals imposed from outside.Perhaps the most controversial finding is on our approach towards elections. It concludes that the building blocks of democracy – the rule of law, checks and balances, the protection of minorities – matter more than the actual act of holding an election, important though that seminal moment of democracy can be.Even more significantly, the report argues that the rush to multi-party elections is often a mistake far better to take time in resolving disputes and conflicts, forging a genuine national consensus on power sharing, and putting in place checks and balances that may help to prevent another slide towards violence and state failure.Despite the obvious challenges of helping fragile states, I am confident for the future. The world is richer than ever. We have transformational technology at our fingertips that can help cut out corruption and deliver aid more effectively. We’ve seen examples where reconciliation and peace processes have genuinely worked. Look at Singapore, Rwanda, Colombia – they show that countries can escape the fragility trap. I am determined that, with the right approach, many more will too.• David Cameron is a former prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/072a4e4c532fffc51bb31783b6accf75af30d655/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=658383f4dadbcf49f4461ae7a4965ddd 1240w","title":"britain housing market broken labour council houses","story":"We plan to build genuinely affordable homes for the millions of people priced out of the systemThe housing market is broken, and, after eight long years it is clear that current Conservative housing policy is failing to fix it. Ministers talk big about housebuilding targets to be reached some time in the next decade. But what new homes we build, and who they’re for, matter just as much as how many we build.To make housing more affordable, we need to build more affordable homes, and to hardwire housing affordability through the system, from planning to funding to delivery. The public know this: eight in 10 people think ministers should be doing more to get affordable housing built.We will build for those who need it, including the very poorest and most vulnerable, with a big boost to new social rented homes. And we will also build Labour’s new affordable homes for those in work on ordinary incomes who are priced out of the housing market and being failed by housing policy. This is the “just coping” class in Britain today, who do the jobs we all rely on – IT workers, HGV drivers, joiners, warehouse managers, lab technicians, nurses, teaching assistants, call centre supervisors, shop staff.We must start by halting the huge loss of the vital affordable homes we already have. So we’ll stop the sell-off of 50,000 social rented homes a year by suspending the right to buy, ending all conversions to “affordable rent” and scrapping the government’s plans to force councils to sell the best of their homes. We will transform the planning system with a new duty to deliver affordable homes, an English Sovereign Land Trust to make more land available more cheaply and an end to the “viability” loophole that lets commercial developers dodge their obligation to deliver affordable homes. And we will back councils, housing associations and community providers with the funding and flexibility to build big for their communities.Our efforts to transform affordable housing has been redoubled after the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower, a tragedy that shocked the nation. When a country as decent and well-off as ours cannot ensure something as basic as a safe home for all its citizens, things must change. And when Grenfell survivors contributing to our green paper say that “tenants were victims before the fire” and “we’re treated as second-class citizens in social housing”, then radical, root-and-branch reform is needed. So we will make safe homes for all the very highest priority, with sprinklers fitted in high-rise blocks and fire safety the first standard in a new decent homes programme. And we will give new rights for affordable housing residents, including tenants on boards, a new national tenants’ commissioner, new transparency standards and a vote on estate regeneration schemes.The green paper is a signal of our intent and ambition to fundamentally change the housing prospects for millions of people in this country – and to lead a new national debate about how we can finally bring an end to Britain’s housing crisis.• John Healey is shadow secretary of state for housing and planning"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fb414b85f91523bcf7755c30724c92b1f6855a/0_0_4823_2894/master/4823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fbb547e584394284a98a8f5326baa54f 1240w","title":"emmanuel macron moderate owen jones","story":"The French president is hailed as a centrist saviour, a bulwark against extremes – even as he cuts taxes for the wealthy, attacks workers’ rights and demonises refugeesThe world has gone mad, the fanatics of left and right are on the march, the voices of reason have been sidelined. This is the view of the self-styled “moderates” or “centrists” of the political world and the commentariat. There has been little reflection about how the broken economic model they defended unleashed so much anger\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspdisillusionment.Rather than debating ideas and policies, they longingly gaze after allegedly charismatic men who might act as saviours. David Miliband is the eternal prince over the water. But their international icon, France’s Emmanuel Macron, provides an instructive lesson in what “centrist” politics means in practice.For the less affluent, it’s a different story. This former investment banker has slashed housing benefit, and hiked taxes on pensioners – in a country where the average monthly pension is just €1,300 (£1,100). His policies have shifted the workplace balance of power from workers to bosses. French students are staging occupations and protests against more selective entry requirements for universities, derided as an attack on free universal education and France’s social model.Another pillar of his agenda is privatisation, including of France’s airports and part of the national energy utility. His confrontation with rail workers is seen as an attempt to lay the foundations for a catastrophic British-style privatisation of the railway industry. EU-mandated deregulation will mean foreign companies can soon compete with the state rail company SNCF, and Macron is transforming it from a state enterprise into a limited company exactly what happened with the formerly state-owned France Télécom.So-called centrists are supposed to be socially liberal. Macron exposes this pernicious myth for what it is. A man who courted left-leaning voters by promising a humane policy towards migrants and refugees now has them firmly in his sights. The number of days a person without papers can be imprisoned in a detention centre is to be doubled the consideration time period for asylum has been halved, meaning fewer refugees will be accepted. Charities warn that refugees fleeing war will be deported. Macron’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, claims that communities are “breaking up because they are overwhelmed by the inflow of asylum seekers”. No wonder the far-right Front National has described his policies as a “political victory”.Macron offers no future for France, let alone any other western society. There is hope, however. For years after François Hollande betrayed his 2012 election pledge to break with austerity, the French left was in the doldrums. Polls showed that the far right was strongest among the disillusioned, insecure younger generation. The rise of radical left politician Mélenchon changed that: he won nearly a fifth of the vote in the first round of the presidential election, partly by prising some of the disaffected from the jaws of the far right.Macron is presented as an oasis of moderation, a bulwark against the extremes. But there is nothing moderate about slashing taxes on the wealthy, attacking workers’ rights or demonising refugees. He represents a doubling down on an economic model that bred mass insecurity and proved an essential ingredient in the revival of French fascism.It is the same across the west. An unjust economic model long defended by parties of the centre right and centre left – one that brought an economic crash that led to austerity and attacks on living standards – is squarely responsible for the polarisation of politics. If the left fails to provide an inspiring, coherent alternative, it will be the radical right that will triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507eac77a09e4db20e8117e6e7cdcab87d5814e6/0_74_1427_856/master/1427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0a4d365cc98dfbc8ce5c4de5e8da9b8a 1240w","title":"new guidance to help consumers make better meat choices","story":"Campaign draws up eight principles to guide people who want to be healthier and reduce their environmental impactEating less meat has long been advocated for our health and that of the planet, but the choices we make within that advice can be just as important, according to a new report.Choosing lamb, for instance, means the animal is almost certain to have been grass-fed and free range, as sheep are not factory farmed in the same way as pigs or chickens. Meat from pasture-fed animals also tends to have higher levels of “good” fats, which are healthier.Do you know your grass-fed from your pasture for life? Your outdoor-bred from your outdoor-reared?Food labels\u0026nbspare a\u0026nbspminefield for consumers, with a bewildering variety of different marques denoting widely erging standards.Eating Better, the alliance of more than 50 NGOs that is\u0026nbsphoping to encourage people to eat “less and better”\u0026nbspwhen it comes to meat and dairy products, found: “Currently, there is no label that delivers neatly across all our better meat and dairy principles, although organic comes closest.”The organic label is regulated at EU level, with clear prescriptions on what practices are allowed and banned. However, the Soil Association logo denotes food that has gone beyond the EU standard, for instance on antibiotic use and slaughter practices.At the other end of the scale, quality assurance schemes such as the familiar Red Tractor fail to ensure higher welfare, the report found. Instead, while Red Tractor provides assurances on the provenance of products, that they are from the UK, the standards it stipulates are only the legal minimum that applies anyway to UK food production.Free range also covers a multitude of standards, including chickens kept at densities at which their access to the outdoors is so crowded they cannot reach it in practice. So consumers should look not only for a free range demarcation but also a higher-welfare label if possible - for instance, the “Pasture Promise” label for free range dairy certifies that cows have been grazed outside for at least six months a year, and fed on silage or hay in the winter. By contrast, grass-fed can mean animals that are kept indoors but fed on grass products.Outdoor-bred can mean animals are only born and live with their mothers outside for four to six weeks, then moved indoors after weaning, unlike outdoor-reared by which they are given outdoor access for most of their lives.The new campaign, by the Eating Better coalition of more than 50 civil society groups, shows consumers how the choices of meat and dairy products they buy have an impact on global problems, such as climate change, antibiotic use, hunger and malnutrition, and animal welfare. They hope that advocating a “less and better” approach will help consumers to reduce the adverse environmental impact of their food choices, as well as proving healthier.Eight principles have been drawn up to help people navigate the minefield of confusing and sometimes conflicting advice, and to draw clear parallels between what is in our shopping baskets and the health of the planet.For instance, buying smaller amounts of meat at a time cuts down on waste and improves health, as guidelines suggest keeping red meat to no more than 70g a day. Avoiding intensively reared animals also cuts down on antibiotic overuse, which is increasingly a threat to human health.The principles are intended to help people who want to be healthier and reduce their environmental impact, without having to move to vegetarianism or veganism, and while improving farm animal welfare.Sue Dibb, coordinator of the alliance, said: “Industrial livestock production is having a devastating impact on our health, animal welfare and the health of the planet. As people are becoming more conscious about what they eat, a less and better approach to meat and dairy provides a positive way forward.”Consumers are also confused by the labelling on foods. The report found the organic label is the most straightforward as it is laid down in EU law, leaving little room for doubt over the standards required to meet it. However, labels such as “free range” are open to a variety of interpretations, which can make shopping a minefield for consumers who want to make more ethical and healthier choices. Eating Better wants clearer labelling on foods.The coalition, whose backers include Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Compassion in World Farming, also wants the government to take action to reward “extensive” instead of “intensive” farming, to enforce tough regulations on factory farming and to curb the spread of “megafarms” across the British countryside.Dibb said: “We urgently need the government to play its part. Brexit provides a timely opportunity to put our livestock production and consumption on to a more sustainable footing and to support and encourage farming practices that benefit animal welfare, the environment and our health.”The report is timed to coincide with the consultation the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is undertaking on the future of farming after the UK leaves the EU. It sets out in detail the rationale for policymakers to prioritise extensive and small-scale farming in the UK, which would revitalise farming communities by allowing for the continuance of family farms, which are under threat from increasing moves towards intensive megafarm style production. There are now more than 800 megafarms in the UK, the Guardian revealed last year.Defra has called for views from farmers, farming organisations, conservation groups, consumer champions and other interested parties for its wide-ranging consultation. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has repeatedly said that any taxpayer-funded support for farmers after Brexit would be dependent on them delivering public goods, which would include environmental protection as well as food production.The Eat Better coalition’s eight principles for eating meat and dairy, listed below, are fully explained in this PDF.1.

Ahead of a new V\u0026ampA show, she talks about reclaiming her name, the joy of nature and the trouble with fast fashionStella McCartney is a designer, a businesswoman and an environmental activist, but of the three, she says, fashion will always come first. “It has to, you see. Because the only way for me to start the conversation I want to start is by making a product that you want to buy and that you are going to spend your hard-earned money on. If the product is rubbish, then there is no conversation to be had. If I don’t have a successful business, then I’m an environmentalist who happens to be Paul McCartney’s daughter, and that is a conversation which lasts about three seconds. No one is going to come back for more of that chat.”McCartney is at the V\u0026ampA in London for the launch of Fashioned from Nature, an exhibition opening on Saturday that tackles the complex relationship between fashion and the natural world. In other words, the very axis McCartney has been obsessing over for two decades. She was an outlier when she launched her cruelty-free, sustainably minded brand in 2001, but has found the centre of gravity shifting in her direction. “When I was younger, just saying you were vegetarian at someone else’s dinner table wasn’t often a pleasant conversation. So I learned early on how to navigate those conversations and I learned early on that there were ways of introducing a different mindset.” “I come at fashion with lightness of heart. I shot my last ad campaign in a landfill site for a reason, and to make a point, obviously. But the models looked happy, there was lightness, there was colour. My messaging is not the kind that is going to make you panic or feel rubbish about yourself or not sleep at night, because I don’t think that achieves much.” McCartney and her family – husband Alasdhair Willis and four children Miller, 13, Beckett, 11, Bailey, 10 and Reiley, 7 – live in London but spend weekends in the Worcestershire countryside, where she rides her horses and tends her garden. “Everything comes from nature. I mean, where does colour come from, if not from nature, from the changing of the seasons? Every fabric we use is emulating something from nature. Nature is … oh man, it’s magnificent, isn’t it?”Many of fashion’s great artists have been obsessed with nature. Christian Dior was a knowledgable gardener who channelled his passion into pieces such as his 1952 Vilmorin dress, hand-embroidered by the house of Rebe with thousands of tiny daisies. Alexander McQueen dressed women in dresses of razor clam shells, headdresses of antlers and shoes modelled on armadillo hooves. But the relationship has a dark side, from the fur trade to the monumental environmental impact of a global fashion industry that expends the Earth’s resources on clothes that are surplus to requirements. A survey of 2,000 British women by Barnardo’s last year found that the average piece of clothing was worn just seven times before being thrown away.The Stella McCartney pieces chosen for the exhibition reflect the contrasting emotions swirling around clothes and natural beauty. A catwalk outfit from last year features a horse print from the Stubbs painting Horse Frightened by a Lion, referencing the love of the countryside, of animals, and of horses in particular that McCartney inherited from her mother, Linda McCartney, still a constant presence in Stella’s world 20 years after she died. In another display case, the Mylo Falabella Prototype 1 is a handbag created in collaboration with the biotechnology company Bolt Threads, using a groundbreaking alternative to leather made from mycelium, which is the root structure of a mushroom. (“Please don’t call it mushroom leather, will you,” pleads a V\u0026ampA spokesperson wearily. “Mycelium is completely different from mushroom leather.”)From what feminism looks like on the red carpet to how to dress ethically, fashion finds itself in the eye of the moral storm. The primacy of inidual choice is the ideology of our age, and what we wear is the most public manifestation of that. It has become fashionable among prominent designers to make a moral stand and renounce fur: Donatella Versace last month joined Gucci and Michael Kors in proclaiming her brand fur-free. McCartney is happy to see this shift, although, from where she stands, it has taken too long. “Fur … it’s so medieval,” she sniffs. A personal ideology that was rooted in animal rights grew into “being mindful of the impact that fashion has on the environment, and became a conversation about this industry being the second most destructive industry that there is. And once you are aware of that, as a lover of nature and of life, you can’t ignore that.”Fashioned from Nature is the latest in a procession of fashion-related museum shows, with an Azzedine Alaïa retrospective at the Design Museum and the V\u0026ampA’s take on Frida Kahlo’s wardrobe and image hot on its heels. Central to it, says the curator, Edwina Ehrman, is the need “to get away from the idea that sustainable fashion should look quirky. We need leaders like Stella McCartney, who can tell scientists what the future needs to look like.”An exhibition is always telling a story about the era it is staged in, as much as about the past. Fashioned from Nature s a time period from 1600 to the present day, but it is a very different show than it would have been even a decade ago. Awareness has grown exponentially around the environmental impact of the fashion industry, which produces greenhouse gas emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year, larger than that of international flights and shipping combined. To tackle this, “we need to completely rewire the hierarchies of fashion”, says Ehrman. The mindset by which a dress made up of rare materials imported from far-flung corners of the globe is the first to be put in a museum is finally being challenged.Those who scoff at the notion that the modern consumer might be made to read a shirt label and be impressed by, say, flax – a sustainable fibre because, when grown in the right climate, it needs no irrigation – should be encouraged by the clean eating movement, argues Ehrman. “The way the modern consumer behaves around food – reading the label, taking pride in knowing about ingredients, wanting to identify as the type of person who is knowledgable and makes informed choices – shows what is possible.” But for this to happen requires us “to reconnect with fabric, and fabric has been forgotten in modern fashion, which is all about surface and decoration. If we feel fabrics again, engage with our clothes on a tactile, sensual level, we might start valuing them sufficiently to be motivated to sew buttons back on, or hems back up.”The emotional trigger of ethical fashion has long belonged to animal rights. McCartney’s refusal to use leather and fur is the one fact everyone knows about her. Many of the most startling exhibits in Fashioned from Nature are those for which animals have grotesquely suffered: a pair of Brazilian red-legged honeycreeper birds made into earrings, their tiny bodies dangling like pompoms, would have been a prized accessory for a fashionable woman of the late 19th century. A dress made in the 1860s features embroidered “flowers” with the petals made up of about 5,000 iridescent green beetle wings, most of which would have been harvested from live beetles.But as awareness of animal rights pushes fur towards being a footnote in fashion history, fast fashion has become the focus. The poor record of workers’ rights in the production of fast fashion, its convoluted supply chains, environmentally reckless dye processes and short wardrobe life make cheaply produced garments the villain of the modern fashion piece. The circular economy is the buzz phrase in the industry – McCartney recently partnered with the RealReal, a resale company, to encourage shoppers to keep clothes in circulation by selling them on. But the issue cannot be tackled on a meaningful scale until it engages with the consumer who has neither the budget for designer fashion nor relatives dropping off piles of hand-me-down cashmere.There is just one high-street garment in Fashioned from Nature, a dress made from recycled ocean plastic from H\u0026ampM’s Conscious range. McCartney’s elegant ethics are beyond the budget of most people. She says she wishes more people “would save up and buy one thing at Stella McCartney instead of the 20 things they buy from a fast-fashion label”, but I am not convinced that most family budgets work like this. McCartney’s label takes another step upmarket this year with the opening of a new London flagship, on which she has been working “like a bat out of hell”, situated, symbolically, on Bond Street. (Her previous store was just off London’s main luxury drag.) What’s more, her name has been mentioned as a possible wedding dress designer for Meghan Markle. “I read this morning that you are designing the royal wedding dress,” I say to McCartney as she is preparing to leave. She laughs and raises a sceptical eyebrow. “Oh, you did, did you? You’re hilarious. How many designers have you said that to today?” That’s not a denial then, I point out. “Well, you didn’t actually ask a question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75774357628d4fbb572c121d97fc15057053feb3/435_115_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f4b102515da3112c55b138bf36617213 1240w","title":"bournemouth manchester united premier league match report","story":"Three days before the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham, and in the aftermath of Sunday’s pathetic defeat by West Brom, a drama-free win is enough for Manchester United. That is what they achieved thanks to goals by Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku. The result tightens their hold on second place in the Premier League and raises spirits, at least a little, before they resume their pursuit of the only trophy they can win this season.After offering another reminder of his personal roll of honour – “eight titles in four different countries, including three in this country” – he said: “I know why you win and why you don’t win. No doubt about City’s quality and that in any circumstances they would win this title this season but we could have perfectly, I would say, 10 more points this season.”Mourinho made seven changes to the lineup who were embarrassed by West Brom but perhaps the most intrigue concerned a change the manager did not make: did the inclusion of Paul Pogba, who had been withdrawn before the hour on Sunday, indicate Mourinho wanted to see a performance that would convince him the club’s record signing deserves to start against Spurs?If so, Mourinho got the display he wanted. Pogba did not cast spells but did play very well. He affected the game positively almost every time he got the ball, which was not often enough for him to be described as having dictated play. Mourinho acclaimed a “top performance” from the Frenchman, who crowned his display by teeing up Lukaku for the goal in the 70th minute that made sure of United’s victory.Smalling had given United the lead in a low-key first half by converting from close-range after a sharp move. Ander Herrera, the most influential of United’s trio in midfield, was instrumental, playing a neat pass to Jesse Lingard, whose crisp low cross left Smalling with a straightforward finish.The goal came one minute after Marcus Rashford injected spark into a humdrum game by winning possession off Nathan Aké before firing off a shot that forced a ing save from Asmir Begovic.Rashford was deployed centrally because Lukaku was on the bench. The 20-year-old looked dangerous, combining well with Lingard and Anthony Martial. All three, without quite catching fire, made reasonable claims for starting at Wembley ahead of Alexis Sánchez.Other players were given opportunities to stake claims, too – or perhaps just to add another word to their long goodbyes from United. Luke Shaw did fine at left-back on his first appearance since being hauled off at half-time against Brighton last month. The right-back Matteo Darmian did not disappoint on his first league start since October. Marouane Fellaini, who is expected to leave Old Trafford on the expiry of his contract in the summer, completed the midfield trio adequately on his sixth start of the campaign.United bossed most of the match against hosts minded to make their visit uncomfortable. Josh King did ruffle United just before the break, however, drawing a save from David de Gea with a shot from 20 yards.The visitors started the second period as if ordered to wrap up the win as quickly as possible. Bournemouth resolved to try to fend them off and hope to equalise on the break. They came close to doing so in the 56th minute but Callum Wilson was unable to connect with King’s ball across the six-yard box – the striker claimed that was because Shaw had pulled him back but the referee disagreed. Soon afterwards Smalling was booked for dragging down Wilson near halfway. One minute later Steve Cook received a similar punishment for a far more brutal tackle on Pogba. As tempers and the tempo rose a touch, the game became more open. That displeased Mourinho, who decided it was time to introduce Lukaku in an attempt to finish off Bournemouth.Lukaku soon fulfilled his mission. Racing on to a through-ball from Pogba, he held off Aké and clipped the ball over Begovic into the net from 12 yards.There might have been a late twist if Wilson had been awarded a penalty after going down in the box following a loose tackle by Smalling but the referee did not whistle and the travelling fans kept singing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7b463b73732a2df2f8e481b8b82cdfc72c38a2/173_48_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39702ee228af240abbbcf3a361c70cf6 1240w","title":"chelsea antonio conte easier to manage small clubs burnley","story":"Antonio Conte believes he has a more difficult job than Sean Dyche and other managers who have smaller transfer budgets and are expected to fight\u0026nbsprelegation.The Premier League table shows minimal difference between Chelsea, in fifth, and Burnley, who lie seventh, but perceptions could hardly be more contrasting. It has been cast as a failure for Conte’s defending champions while Dyche, whose team had been expected to struggle, has led Burnley to challenge for a Europa League place.Conte praised his counterpart before Thursday night’s game at Turf Moor but left little doubt he did not take kindly to their performances being compared directly, making particular reference to a difference in transfer priorities.“He is doing an important job, a great job this season,” Conte said of Dyche. “But if you start the season fighting to avoid the relegation zone it is more simple – also if you have a small budget, because you can count on the team that in the past qualified to play again in the league. It is more difficult when you have to prepare in the transfer market to win something, because only one team wins.”His point was that having finished 16th last season, Burnley could rely on the same core of players to survive again and had little need to seek reinforcements, a longstanding cause of tension between Conte and the Chelsea hierarchy.Asked to elaborate, he suggested it was harder for those looking to avoid the drop – an ambition he gave to half the teams in the Premier League – to fail than those that are expected to win trophies. “You have to avoid the last three places at the bottom, and then you can stay between 10 teams that play only for this target,” he said. “You have to fight only to avoid this.“It is difficult if you have to play to win because only one team wins and if the other doesn’t win you are the first to speak about a failed season.

Yet pulses (dried legume seeds including lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas) still suffer from a serious image problem. Britain hoovers up hummus and baked beans, but, outside foodie circles, cooking with pulses – especially dried pulses, which need pre-soaking – is often regarded as too much hassle, for a food that is commonly portrayed as a right-on penance rather than a source of pleasure. Clean-eating’s wispy gurus have given many obscure health foods a glossy modern sheen, but, in pop cultural terms, the lentil’s most famous exponent remains Neil from The Young Ones.Yet, despite all that, quietly, British pulses are rising. I meet Chandler at the British Dal festival in Bristol, a new event held in March, funded by the British Edible Pulses Association (Bepa). A week-long patchwork of community events from lentil planting in Millennium Square to a dal cook-off at the closing Grand Dal Finale (attended by almost 1,000 people), it sought to celebrate all pulse stews, from mushy peas to chana dal.Fresh from a primary school dal cookery class and lunch at Bristol farmers’ market (where Thali Cafe gave away more than 200 portions of dal), Chandler is evangelical about pulses – be it dried or tinned. “They’re incredibly economical and versatile chameleons in that they’ll take on whatever Italian, Spanish, Mexican or Indian flavours you want, and they’re delicious,” she says. “They’re also nutritious, full of protein and fibre, and a no-brainer if you’re worried about gaining weight or blood-sugar levels because you’ve got this complex carbohydrate, slow-release energy. They keep you full for hours, and feeling content rather than sluggish.”Across town in Bristol’s staunchly indie Stokes Croft enclave, the eco-focused Poco Tapas is fully engaged with the potential of pulses. In particular, it is an early adopter of the UK-grown pulses distributed by Suffolk’s pioneering Hodmedod. A bustling, unvarnished bar-restaurant, Poco uses Hodmedod’s fava beans to make silky hummus and crisp, airy falafel, just as the Egyptians do. It also uses earthy carlin peas (AKA Lancashire’s black peas) in a dish of merguez sausage and labneh, and Hodmedod’s yellow split peas – larger than a lentil, but with that same creamy, melting quality – in its dal.Sitting in Poco, fresh from manning Hodmedod’s stall for the dal festival, Nick Saltmarsh, one of its co-founders, explains: “All over the world, as societies become richer, pulses are shunted away as the food of the poor, and those who can afford it eat meat. In Britain, from the Black Death onwards, we ate more meat and dairy, stopped relying on beans as a main protein source and they fell out of fashion.”However, the growing cost and ecological impact of eating meat, along with concerns about food security, could help pulses stage a comeback. The few hundred tonnes of UK pulses that Hodmedod distributes annually, sourced from a small network of dedicated farms, is a tiny fraction of total UK production, estimated at 730,000 tonnes, and Hodmedod’s wackier projects, such as last year’s first commercial UK lentil harvest, are at this stage totemic. But its rapid growth has demonstrated that you can create an appetite for UK pulses, even the neglected, mysterious fava bean, and that is has been noted by the larger pulse players.Long-term, Hodmedod wants to see a transformative shift in UK agricultural policy, away from huge, monocultural cereal farms reliant on artificial fertilisers, to a more erse farming culture that would include the cultivation of a variety of low-intensity pulses for UK consumers. This would be hugely beneficial, it argues, ecologically and for public health.There are precedents for such a change. In the past 30 years, Canada has radically increased its pulse production. It is now the world’s largest exporter of peas and lentils. However, as outlined in a recent Processors and Growers Research Organisation report, a similar British revolution would require significant state intervention, in everything from the funding of seed research to procurement directives for schools and hospitals. Bepa met MPs at Westminster in 2016 and Bristol East MP (and vegan) Kerry McCarthy has, says Smith, made Bepa’s case to ministers Liam Fox and Michael Gove. But getting the cabinet interested in pulses is difficult. “We’re starting to make waves, which is good, but until the last six to 12 months, we’ve had absolutely no impact at governmental level,” he says.For its part, Hodmedod continues to scatter its seed beyond wholefood stores by introducing products into delis and farm shops, promoting UK pulses to restaurants such as River Cottage, Mark Hix and Honey \u0026amp Co, and embracing convenience with its tinned fava, haricot and carlin peas. It even makes its own baked beans and salted beans, the latter tapping into what Saltmarsh believes could be a big growth area: pulse-based snacks (he namechecks Yushoi’s baked pea crisps and PepsiCo’s Off the Eaten Path brand). “The increased interest in pulses is striking,” he says.Hodmedod’s 99p-a-tin pulses are not the cheapest. “We can’t compete with 30p imported chickpeas. At our scale that’s hardly the cost of the can,” admits Saltmarsh, but, perversely, the wider visibility of premium pulses – which gram-for-gram are still cheaper than most meat and other proteins – may positively improve the image of fava beans and field peas. “Pulses became maligned as this really cheap thing. You’ve got to take the deprivation out of it and make people realise how delicious pulse dishes are,” says Chandler.But what of another significant problem? Not one of price or convenience, but flatulence? Will pulses always be followed by an ill wind that inhibits their popularity? Chandler thinks the issue is overblown: “My family had 18 months of serious pulse-eating for my book and, this sounds bizarre, I think you become more tolerant and less windy as you get used to them.”Failing that, there are ingredients you can add, such as cumin or seaweed, that are thought to break down the oligosaccharides that cause those explosive after-effects. If you are keen to explore the world of pulses beyond baked beans, it’s worth bearing in mind. Your family and friends will be forever grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a384e02b078e1ee60f8ca856e46a73dacd154f/93_325_6505_3903/master/6505.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d40726e238c6aa05aa037a753e1fda76 1240w","title":"rogue landlords should have properties confiscated mp report","story":"Committee calls on government to give local councils power to punish ‘most egregious offences’Rogue landlords should have their properties confiscated by local councils, according to a cross-party report from MPs into Britain’s private rented sector. Current financial penalties are “meaningless” in deterring the worst, criminal offenders among landlords, according to the housing, communities and local government committee.The committee also called for greater protection for tenants from evictions, rent increases and harassment, noting that 800,000 private rented homes suffer from excess cold, mould or faulty wiring. However, it made no recommendations for rent controls.MPs on the committee called on the government “to give local authorities the power to confiscate properties from those committing the most egregious offences and whose business model relies on the exploitation of vulnerable tenants”.It said in some areas up to 25 people could be found living in houses of only three bedrooms, “while some landlords charge rent of up to £500 for a bed in a room with four bunkbeds”. But the MPs said it was striking that six out of 10 councils had not prosecuted a single landlord in 2016. Councils told the MPs that “some of the fines levied are pitiful” – often only £100 or £200 – yet it can cost local authorities thousands to take landlords to court. The report by MPs comes amid mounting concerns over Britain’s rapidly expanding private rental sector. Earlier this week the Resolution Foundation said one third of today’s millennial generation will never own their own home, with many forced to raise families in insecure and often substandard rental accommodation. It advocated rent caps and longer-term secure tenancies. Clive Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, who chairs the committee, said: “The imbalance in power in the private rented sector means vulnerable tenants often lack protection from unscrupulous landlords who can threaten them with retaliatory rent rises and eviction if they complain about unacceptable conditions in their homes.”The government has said that it is already cracking down on problems in the rental market and is working on plans to introduce a single housing ombudsman, and new legislation to make it easier for tenants to take legal action.A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Everyone deserves a safe and decent home and we have given councils stronger powers to crack down on bad landlords, including fines of up to £30,000 and banning orders.”The Residential Landlords Association, which represents 50,000 landlords who own 250,000 homes, said it welcomed much of the report. However, it added that further regulation – the MPs also called for a Law Commission review of tenancy laws – would be unwelcome. “The RLA has long been concerned with the increasing complexity of laws and regulations related to private rented housing, which cause uncertainty for all those in the sector.”Campaigners at Generation Rent, a group representing tenants, said many tenants were just too frightened to complain about squalid conditions. Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent said: “Having the confidence to complain is just one reason why the government should strengthen protections from eviction and rent hikes. Growing numbers of people living longer in the private rental market – including one in four children – need greater security regardless of whether their landlord is flouting safety standards, so the committee has missed an opportunity to go further in its recommendations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83da6ea394233b9cc152a535aa020e2357b03da1/127_21_1147_688/master/1147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7a513fcbc10dbd28b2fc29117c754df1 1240w","title":"talkmobile vodafone takeover contracts offers deals","story":"Vodafone explains that while it owns Talkmobile, the brand operates its own price plans and processes, and existing customers can continue their Talkmobile contracts.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The festival is set to be more with it and edgy than ever before with a late-night prom celebrating the music of modern New York.The Proms director, David Pickard, said it was part of his remit to explore the new in all forms of music. “It is contemporary music from across New York as it’s happening at the moment,” he said. “It is a very vibrant scene in terms of what people are writing, and it is boundary-crossing as well – there is a lot of experimentation going on.”He said barriers were coming down across the music world and that the Proms should reflect that: “There is a fluidity there that hasn’t existed before, and I think it is partly to do with a younger listener who is less compartmentalised.”The New York prom will be presented by Jules Buckley and the Heritage Orchestra and will feature guests including the classically trained gospel revivalist Serpentwithfeet, the singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten and the dance collective Hercules and Love Affair.The 2018 Proms will also mark a number of anniversaries, including the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which paved the way for universal suffrage. Proms organisers said 24 female composers would be featured this year – more, it is thought, than ever before. Among the contemporary composers included are Anna Meredith, who has created a work to be premiered on the first night of the Proms, and Roxanna Panufnik, who will be part of the coveted last night.After the successful staging last year of a prom outside London for the first time since 1930, when the event went to Hull, this year it will travel to the Drill Hall in Lincoln for a performance of Stravinsky’s The Soldier’s Tale, written in 1918.Other anniversaries marked during the eight-week festival will be the birth of Leonard Bernstein, with performances of West Side Story, On the Town and a re-creation of one of the two proms Bernstein conducted the death of Claude Debussy the end of the first world war the death of Hubert Parry, composer of Jerusalem and the death of Lili Boulanger, a composer well known to musicians but not the wider public.“She died at 24 and left this small but brilliant legacy,” said Pickard. “She is someone who is known to conductors, but they rarely get the chance to perform her work.”There will be more than 90 concerts, with around a dozen that are not strictly classical. This year that category includes a prom given over to the talents of the young jazz prodigy Jacob Collier, who made his name as a YouTube phenomenon a prom celebrating music from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and a tango prom celebrating Argentine music, as well as tango’s less well-known variant in Finland.To mark the 40th anniversary of the BBC Young Musician competition, there will be the first ever “young musician prom”, with 20 of its alumni including Nicola Benedetti, Michael Collins and Sheku Kanneh-Mason.Among the classical Proms debuts will be Geneva’s Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, in its centenary year Teodor Currentzis and his ensemble MusicAeterna performing punked-up Beethoven and the disabled-led ensemble BSO Resound.Organisers said more than 100,000 tickets would be available at under £15, with standing (or “promming”) tickets costing £6 and every prom broadcast live on BBC Radio 3."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe16c8ee820d693b4830cbefa23441f5f1db162/2_0_10413_6250/master/10413.jpg?w=10250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1d50ca2e10c45b1f91e8e51e04fa90 20500w","title":"wolves of instagram jordan belmont social media traders","story":"Their hero is Jordan Belfort, their social media feeds display super-rich lifestyles. But what are these self-styled traders really selling? By  Symeon BrownThe original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. The Mail headline described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his almost comedic YouTube channel, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. His Instagram, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.They are the wolves of Instagram.The financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as spread betting and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which published a list of unauthorised firms and guidelines for aspiring traders.The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that £59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017 from binary options alone.“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”My first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of #richkidsofinstagram, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After Rich Kids Go Shopping, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.Oyefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was fined $11m for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.The pack of Instagram wolves has spread far beyond Oyefeso’s network in London. Twenty-three-year-old Eddy Samuel grew up on the outskirts of Manchester. The city has received billions in private and public investment, but Samuel was not well placed to benefit from the new jobs that new money created.“I hardly got any GCSEs,” Samuel recently told me. “I got one Btec. I never really had an education.” After a string of minimum-wage jobs, he did some landscape gardening. “That was my last ever job,” he said. Together with two friends, he was drawn into the supposedly glamorous Instagram-world of fast cars and designer clothes that young men the same age as them appeared to have. The pressure to join them was almost torturous.“We are all from council estates – every single one of us,” Samuel said. “Seeing other people do it and wanting to get involved in it ourselves, being broke. I’m out of a job, we’re like – we need something else to get things going.” The company they launched, called Trading XL, has never been registered at Companies House.Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called Trading Life, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.Technology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer Gambling claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”The cryptocurrency craze is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1be1cd6779be74f1c20c13734681e8708ec7ae8/186_2_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c41809e12edf361aebe50118eda3c48c 1240w","title":"jeremy hunt investigated breach money laundering rules luxury flats","story":"Health secretary now under investigation over purchase of luxury apartments on south coastJeremy Hunt received a “bulk discount” on seven flats bought from a Conservative donor, the Guardian can disclose, as parliament’s watchdog opened an investigation into the health secretary’s admission that he breached money laundering rules.The health secretary was forced to apologise for failing to declare his part-ownership of a company, which bought the luxury seaside flats in Southampton.Kathryn Stone, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday. The commissioner’s website confirms that Hunt is now under investigation.Guardian inquiries established that the 82-flat block, called Alexandra Wharf, was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property firm owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Neither Hunt nor Roach agreed to disclose the value of the deal but a source close to the health secretary said he had received a “bulk discount” for buying multiple apartments. A spokesperson for Roach said that all sales at Alexandra Wharf were at “open market value”, adding that the businessman’s political donations had been properly declared on the Electoral Commission website.They added that the pair had known each other for “several years” but had no business relationship beyond the purchase of the flats.A spokesperson for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. “Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase. “As Jeremy has been clear from the outset, the rental income from these properties will be donated to charity.”Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of complimentary venue hire. The pair were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel in Guildford, Surrey, that was developed by Nicolas James Group. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman for the committee on standards in public life said: “In terms of public perception of ministerial priorities, Hunt seems more concerned with maximising his personal interests rather than ensuring that there are good public services.“On a local level, there does seem to be an incestuous relationship between a local donor and a local politician in a way which will make the public uneasy.”According to the MPs’ code of conduct, “members shall fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the House in respect of the registration of interests in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests”.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only Hunt’s wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m.The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2019fced7d93af14d85ce6216f74d9ada8979306/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53318337177f31f19695436b134fdcf6 1240w","title":"ministers to announce brexit climbdown as they face lords defeat","story":"Amendment calling for UK to continue in customs union with EU passed by majority of 123Theresa May was under pressure to reopen the issue of Britain’s membership of a customs union after suffering two big defeats in the House of Lords on the government’s key Brexit bill.Peers backed an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that would force the government to explain what it has done to pursue remaining in a customs union, by 348 votes to 225 – a convincing majority of 123.The government suffered a significant rebellion on the amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Kerr, which received the backing of 24 Conservatives, including former ministers Lord Patten, Lord Heseltine and Lord Willetts. A separate amendment that would limit the power of ministers to slash red tape without the approval of parliament was also passed, by 314 votes to 217.The debate on the government’s key piece of Brexit legislation, in a packed chamber, was watched by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. After the customs union vote, he said: “The passing of this cross-party amendment is an important step forward. Theresa May must now listen to the growing chorus of voices who are urging her to drop her red line on a customs union and rethink her approach.”Explaining why he believed a customs union was so important, Kerr underlined the difficulty of replacing the UK’s trade with the EU with new deals with other countries. “Looking further afield is well worth doing, but it will be very hard not to see a fall in overall exports if our trade with the EU is made more complicated, and it will be much more complicated if we leave the customs union. We must try to limit the damage of our nearest, because closest, market,” he said.The amendment would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”.A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DeExEU) said: “we are disappointed that parliament has voted for this amendment. The fundamental purpose of this bill is to prepare our statute book for exit day, it is not about the terms of our exit. This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in parliament explaining the steps we’ve taken.”But opposition peers hope the substantial support for the amendment could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons.Peers will continue debating and amending the bill for another five days, spread out over the next few weeks. It will then be returned to the House of Commons, where MPs will decide whether to accept the changes, or refer them back to peers, in a process known as “ping pong”. The EU withdrawal bill transfers EU law on to the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit – and grants the government sweeping powers to tweak it in the process.Separately, Labour peers hailed concessions from the government over another amendment, on EU rules on clinical trials. Crossbench peer Lord Patel had tabled an amendment that would ensure EU clinical trial regulations, which have not yet come into force, were enacted in UK law. He withdrew it after reassurances from the government minister in the Lords. A spokesman for the DeExEU said the government would be willing to continue accepting changes to the complex bill as it makes its way through parliament.“We have always said we are open to listen to expertise, be it from peers or MPs, and if we think the bill can be improved, we will move to do so. That will be the approach through the whole process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc51799fd20ba033e1f691609cc2a4a5aa02dec/56_409_5347_3208/master/5347.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cf5b37bb7ac34678541ae47f1c5abb10 1240w","title":"mary keitany paula radcliffe marathon record london","story":"It is a record that has loomed over athletics for 15 years, impervious to challenge. Yet when Mary Keitany starts the London Marathon on Sunday she will be the first runner with a realistic shot at shattering Paula Radcliffe’s world record. And, tantalisingly, she intends to take it.Her pedigree is beyond reproach. The 36-year-old has won in London and New York three times each, and last year ran faster than Radcliffe had ever done in a women’s-only race, scampering away from a stacked field in London after the first mile before finishing in 2hr 17 min 01 sec.It was a staggering display of front-running and it led to the second fastest time in history – even though she slowed down significantly after going through halfway in 64min 55sec because she had to make so much of the pace by herself.This time she will have three male pacemakers around her for the first time, which should enable her to take serious aim at Radcliffe’s overall world record of 2:15.25, which was set with the help of male runners, in 2003.“I have my focus on the world record and hopefully with the help of male pacesetters I will be able to shave a few seconds off the time,” said Keitany, who is 5ft 1in. “If you compare last year to this year, last year I went almost alone from halfway but now I will have someone with me all the way, so it will help a lot.”The mother of two knows it will not be easy to break such a famous record. “Running 2:15 is not easy, it is something else,” Keitany said. “We are trying to follow in the footsteps of a legend, Paula. But because the London Marathon have decided to put in male pacemakers we have to try to see whether it is possible. We will try our level best to see if we can go under.”Unseasonally high temperatures and thunderstorms may thwart those ambitions but Keitany believes she will be able to handle whatever happens. Her confidence is particularly high after setting a personal best of 1:04:55 in the Ras Al Khaimah half-marathon in February.Keitany may not get things her own way on Sunday. The Chicago marathon champion, Tirunesh Dibaba, who finished second last year, is in much better shape this time. “I have more experience and prepared well for the race,” she said. “I will not sit back, but take the race to Keitany.”Dibaba, who has set three world records on the track and won five Olympic medals, has not ruled out attacking Radcliffe’s record. “Breaking Paula’s record is not an easy thing,” she said. “It’s a very challenging one. So I just can’t say I am going to break it but we will see.”With other talented athletes – including the 2017 Berlin marathon winner Gladys Cherono and the 24-year-old Brigid Kosgei, who ran a personal best of 2:20.22 in Chicago last year – also intending to have their say, London could be set for a battle for the ages.It is also worth noting the race will be started by the pioneering American Kathrine Switzer, who in 1967 challenged the all-male tradition of marathon running when she became the first woman to run the Boston marathon.Dibaba was also asked about comments made by Britain’s Laura Muir, who said last month she would not talk to Dibaba’s younger sister Genzebe because of her association with the controversial coach Jama Aden. “I didn’t expect that,” Dibaba said. “It doesn’t bother me. I know my sister and I trust all her training.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24968a80aa7afa710b6bd95110517c76e1f70a5/0_55_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=21ea18d8b3cb34066beaec40e476b5fd 1240w","title":"tms talksport radio change cricket england","story":"Stop all the clocks. Stamp a single steel-toed work boot through Mrs Blenkinsop’s sensational triple-tiered Victoria sponge. Prevent the dog from barking with a bag of gravel. For BBC Test Match Special is dead. Or at least, suspended for a bit over the autumn and winter.Instead commercial radio is back in the shape of TalkSport, which has outbid the BBC for rights to England’s autumn and winter Test tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies. And nothing now can ever come to any good. Except, of course for the fact it may actually be all right.A quick census of the loudest online voices suggests the general response to this news has been somewhere on the spectrum between regret, dismay and a great swirling fudge of mawkish, cake-fondling, doily-clutching Middle England horror.Understandably so, too. It is a mark of the way Test cricket is cherished in England that the idea of different voices bringing it into your kitchen or down through the headphones in the insomniac hours is like a familial loss. Test Match Special is much-loved. For many people its enforced break during the winter will be an absence that goes beyond sport, a missing beat in the rhythms of the day.And yet there are limits to this. The sense of mild hysteria, the social media suggestion that losing TMS for a few months is “worse than Brexit” seems a little overdone. For a start someone should probably check on Jonathan Agnew, who seems to think his employer being outbid for some broadcast rights is a national disaster on the scale of the death of Princess Diana and that ice skating woman falling over all rolled into one. Imagine Princess Diana falling over in an ice skating race, thereby accidentally derailing Charlotte Dujardin’s quest for dressage gold, while simultaneously being denied the right to broadcast cricket on the BBC. That’s how bad we’re talking.Or at least this appears to be the case judging by Agnew’s funereal tweets on the subject. Not only is the self-righteous tone a provocation to every other working broadcaster involved in covering the sport, it also does a disservice to the genuine depth of feeling around this.There are good reasons why cricket on the BBC is an emotive issue. The corporation played a hand in keeping the sport going when it might have died after the second world war, re-spinning its mass popularity into the fabric of the summer. Plenty of us wouldn’t have known cricket existed but for the BBC – Peter West, Tony Lewis and all that, smiling avuncular men in blazers staring right into the camera on a grey Tuesday morning in the dog days of the summer.Plus on a more basic level Test Match Special does a fine job, credit to some brilliant journalists and producers. Simon Mann, Charles Dagnall, Isa Guha, Daniel Norcross and the rest are all excellent. Vic Marks, also of these pages, offers the kind of voice you do not often hear on any media, determinedly anti-sensational voice, wryly humorous in hectoring times. TalkSport will have a huge job on its hands just trying to meet the same standards of analysis and reporting.It should be said Agnew is also a brilliant broadcaster, and hugely popular too, the best out there at simply pointing himself at his sport and talking, with a wonderfully easy style. But he is also a part of why some may welcome a bit of variation, those moments where the sense of vital work being done, of weepy self-importance slips into something else. Imagine the phrase “Bumptious BBC self-regard” baked in a nuclear reactor until it finally grows arms and legs, escapes, kits itself out in chinos and begins talking in a cosy, righteous tone about delivering a vital national service.There is nothing in the rules that says this is the way cricket must be presented, or that everyone will like it. The endless goodbye to Henry Blofeld, for example, was fair enough but I’ve also heard cricket-loving kids say the Blofeld tone is why lots of other kids their age think cricket is just for posh, entitled people. They cringe at the idea of introducing their football-loving schoolmates to the great summer sport only to find Blofeld on, flapping about cakes and pigeons and dear old things. You what, mate?On the other hand new things can be good. Competition can be good. Giving someone else a go can give everyone a lift. At which point enter, to the sound of Darth Vader’s march, the dreaded TalkSport. The new kid will not be to everyone’s taste at first. It can be blokey and relentless, far more tabloid in style and tone. Not to mention overly obsessed with wood stain and van hire, adverts that will jar with the rhythms at first, although past broadcasts suggests this quickly fades.There are deeper currents too. TalkSport is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, which bought the Wireless Group two years ago. Plenty will object to the most ruthless and iconoclastic of media families taking over the presentation of their beloved five-day game. On the other hand the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and West Indies will be grateful for extra funds the BBC would not stretch to.Plus there is plenty of evidence to suggest the product will be decent. Early rumours suggest the excellent Steve Harmison and – yes – even the great David Lloyd may be regulars. Change, different voices, a new audience: these are things cricket has needed for a while. So save the tear-soaked cake crumbs, the sense of bumptious entitlement. You never know, the new world may not be so terrible after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa8b10453b05582d5425a787af3f92d2050126d/198_277_2634_1581/master/2634.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=08fa0368a3a90722de567bba46483708 1240w","title":"the muhammad ali of marbles classic fa cup semis and seedorf","story":"This week’s roundup also features electric skateboard pole-vaulting, a tribute to speedway great Ivan Mauger and county cricket from 19491) To the marbles world championship!

Although reportedly written in a three-week burst and dismissed by its author as a “minor work”, the tale of ultraviolence and criminal correction kept tempting Burgess back to revise, adapt and comment on. In 1986 – more than two decades after the publication of the novel – he turned it into a play peppered with his own songs, now staged at the Liverpool Everyman.It makes a sharp contrast with the first musical offering of the Everyman Rep Company’s 2018 season, Lerner and Loewe’s foot-tapping Paint Your Wagon. Here, the tunes are discordant rather than catchy. Burgess’s music – inspired by and interwoven with his protagonist Alex’s beloved Beethoven – is brilliantly uncanny, only misfiring when it briefly strays into sentimentality. From the first, teasing call of “What’s it going to be then, eh?” it transforms the novel into a chilling, nightmarish cabaret.Troublingly, though perhaps aptly, Nick Bagnall’s production is never more stylish than when portraying Alex (a cold-eyed, sneering George Caple) and his droogs’ violent acts in the opening scenes. It takes a while to settle into the rhythms of this early, episodic section, which inducts us into teenager Alex’s world of random brutality. Spoken – or sung – on stage, Burgess’s invented Nadsat slang can be hard to catch, while Kay Haynes’s unsettling wash of ultraviolet light has a strange, distancing effect on the action. Afterwards, though, it is these striking, stripped-back moments that linger in the memory.When Alex is dispatched to the institutional settings of prison and treatment centre, the style becomes increasingly cartoonish, lampooning the authority figures for whom he is little more than an experiment. The action takes its lead from Burgess’s twisted music-hall tunes, with macabre prison-yard dances and a Muppet-style puppet standing in for the jail’s manipulated governor. It’s only after the interval, as Alex is given his “freedom”, that the pace begins to become sluggish.Without overreaching, Bagnall’s version finds plenty of contemporary resonances – never more so than when a “cured” Alex becomes a political plaything. The Minister of the Interior’s determination to cut crime rates at all costs feels worryingly plausible, as does the jockeying to use Alex as a vote-winning symbol. The one misjudged addition is a baffling and unnecessary visual reference to Jimmy Savile, which tips the scale from the intriguingly disturbing to the outright offensive.No doubt Stanley Kubrick’s film version will loom large in the minds of many audience members, but the Everyman team work hard to create a distinct aesthetic. The spare white frame of Molly Lacey Davies and Jocelyn Meall’s set, with its frequently opening and closing trapdoors, swiftly and seamlessly takes us from city streets to prison to the lab where Alex is conditioned to be repulsed by images of violence. And the music – impressively performed by multi-instrumentalist Peter Mitchell – imposes a compelling layer of strangeness between the violence of Alex’s world and those of us watching it.Perhaps Burgess’s greatest achievement with A Clockwork Orange remains its linguistic inventiveness, conveying the foreignness of adolescence with its own, unique lexicon.

Her single-minded determination is a subject that comes up again and again when talking to her close – and very passionate – family and friends about her rollercoaster career.After an injury five years ago, Perri had to learn to walk again and switch disciplines from hurdles to sprinting. And this month, despite doctors and physiotherapists setting her chances of a full recovery at around zero, she’s competing as a member of Team England in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.“She wasn’t so focused at first,” says Chris Zah, her trainer for the past 18 years. “When we started working together, I made her do everything from 60m sprinting to cross-county. She hated it, and didn’t see the point. As a kid from east London, she really wasn’t keen on mud.”Perri’s outlook changed in 2007, after coming second in the 400m hurdles at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships.“She grabbed me and said: ‘What are we going to do about this then?’” Chris says. “From then on, we agreed to think outside the box. I’d watch her competitors and say: ‘This girl gets to the first hurdle in 6.2 seconds, so you’ve got to get there in 6.1.’ She’d reply: ‘Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’”This attitude, along with her natural talent, pushed Perri to the world No 2 spot in women’s hurdles. But in 2013, she suffered a torn ligament and cartilage damage in her left knee at the finals of the World Championships in Moscow, leaving her unable to walk. “It’s when you’re at your fastest that your body is most likely to break down, and I’d just won two gold medals,” Perri says. “I tried to stay positive, but I went to some dark places.”Her family, along with Chris, rallied round to encourage Perri not to give up, even on her lowest days. “I used to be so frightened, I could only watch her run by peeping between my fingers,” says Perri’s mum, Norma. “I’d get so nervous – like it was me on that starting line. I’d tell her to run like she could see me at the finish line with my arms open. So when she got injured, it was a terrible time – I can’t put it into words. There were a lot of tears. It’s amazing to think how far she’s come since she was sitting on the sofa with her leg up, recovering.”Norma is speaking from LA, where she’s helping niece Jodie celebrate her 30th birthday. The pair’s enthusiasm for talking about Perri, who they call “the CEO of the family”, sees them scrambling to finish each other’s sentences.“We grew up together, so she’s more like my sister than a cousin,” Jodie says of Perri. “When she got injured I dragged her out to parties on her crutches. I told her it could be worse, that she’d bounce back. Now, she’s better and stronger than ever, and she amazes me every day.”Part of Perri’s fierce determination is a legacy from her father, Patrick, who for 14 years was one of boxer Lennox Lewis’s fitness trainers. “She’s passionate and competitive, and so am I,” Patrick says. “I’ve always been there in the background to guide her if she comes unstuck and asks her dad for help.“If she’s down, I’m a picker-upper, and I was there for her for physio and hospital appointments. It’s taken determination and grit to get past her injury, but having good people around you, that’s what gets you through.”In 2014, during her rehabilitation, Perri met her fiance, Mike Edwards, an entrepreneur and athlete. Welcomed by the family with open arms – “It’s like I’ve gained a brother and Norma has gained a son,” Jodie says – he helped Perri to connect with the world beyond sport during her recovery.“Perri had a strong desire to get back on top, but I wanted to offer her positive distractions and give her a bigger life beyond track and field,” Mike explains. “With my cigar business, I’d developed myself as a person and, in turn, Perri had achieved athletic goals I was trying to achieve myself. We really inspired each other.“After all she’s been through, she’s bulletproof. It’s great that we’ve been able to support each other.” Perri has come a long way – and as always, her family will be right behind her in Australia. “Everything she feels, we feel, so it’s like we’re all running that race with her,” Jodie says. “We lifted her back up as a family – and when she competes at the games, everyone will see what we see.”npower – proud sponsors of Team England and Jerusalem, their official anthem for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Here, writers, rangers and guides reveal their favourite spotsExploring Britain and appreciating the charms of its incredible landscape wasn’t always a top priority for me. Like many, I ignored what was on the doorstep as I rushed abroad. Which is nothing new. Celia Fiennes, an early pioneer of the Great British road trip, argued in the 17th century that we should all get out more and explore our homeland to “cure the evil Itch of overvalueing fforeign parts”.Her words ring truer now than ever. In my case, it took a trip to the other side of the planet to jolt me out of my complacency. Back from New Zealand, raving about its scenery, I was swiftly put in my place by a friend: “Haven’t you been to the Highlands of Scotland?”I hadn’t. But since then, I’ve been making up for lost time. Glen Coe, one Britain’s most dramatic landscapes, is popular, being only 30 minutes from Fort William but it’s big enough to feel properly wild, with empty Rannoch Moor providing a suitably contrasting backdrop to the mountains. Some friends and I recently enjoyed a night’s bivvy at the top of Buachaille Etive Mòr, the iconic mountain, but not without incident.A large bird, possibly in league with Satan, tore into our food supplies while backs were turned and then cackled at us all the way down the hill the next day. An incredible place for a night’s sleep but consider bringing a scarecrow. Humphrey Butler, publisher of the Joyously Busy Great British Adventure Map (£14.99, marvellousmaps.com)While northern Dartmoor is beautiful and hilly, the south is vast open moorland with no one around, and Duck’s Pool is one of its remotest parts. We call it the Bermuda Triangle because a lot of Duke of Edinburgh groups tend to get lost there – it’s featureless, boggy and sometimes misty, so can be disorientating and a bit scary. It’s not for the fainthearted and you need to know how to navigate, but the solitude and beauty make it a wonderful place – you can walk for several hours across open terrain.For me, it’s real Dartmoor, the high moorland that only hardier walkers see. It is the site of one of the first “letterboxes”. Letterboxing is a hobby dating back to the 19th century, where walkers follow clues and document their experience by stamping a visitor’s book kept in a “letterbox”. This letterbox is also the site of a memorial stone for William Crossing, who wrote Crossing’s Guide to Dartmoor. John Diplock, director Dartmoor-based activity operator Spirit of AdventureMam Nick is the road that climbs steeply from Edale to Mam Tor, deep within the Peak District national park. The road looks pretty straightforward in cycling terms but once the overhanging trees disappear, the road swings lefts over the Noe river and kicks up twice, hardly giving you chance to appreciate the spectacular views of the valley towards Win Hill. As the road snakes around, there are great views of Back Tor, Lord’s Seat and Kinder Scout behind you, if you care to stop for a breather.I first discovered this route on my bike in 2009 and was surprised how quiet it was compared with the hum of tourists and traffic at better-known Peak District attractions. The road is quiet throughout the week, and used mainly by ramblers and walkers at weekends. The only sound is the occasional call of a red kite or buzzard. Perhaps this is because you won’t find it written on a map – only locals call it Mam Nick.It is one of the toughest cycling climbs and, in the opposite direction, one of the most exhilarating descents in Derbyshire, on what is left of the abandoned Shivering Mountain (Mam Tor) road and the hair-raisingly steep Winnats Pass. Both roads boast amazing views back towards the Hope valley. Thom Barnett, founder of Sheffield-based clothing company MamnickFrom the start of the drive from Llandovery (the nearest town, 10 miles away), you sense that you’re delving deep into the rugged heart of the Cambrian mountains, a truly undiscovered gem of Carmarthenshire. Gwenffrwd–Dinas is an RSPB reserve, set up to protect the habitat of this ancient Atlantic oak woodland. It covers 600 hectares and is best experienced on a circular walk over a couple of hours.Initially, the trail runs alongside the still-infant Towy river, which, even in the driest season, roars across the rocks through the gorge from its source at Llyn Brianne as it cuts through the mystical oak and alder woodland. Use the steps cut out of boulders to take on the challenge of finding the well-hidden cave of Twm Siôn Cati (the Welsh highwayman). The feeling of tranquillity and isolation is spectacular, as red kites, pied flycatchers and tree pipits soar overhead. My favourite time in Dinas is May, when bluebells cast a violet haze over the valley.Alan Warner, countryside rangerThe Lakeland landscape can be ided into four parts, each feeling and looking quite different. The east shifts from scoured fells to woody limestone crags. The south-west is spacious, wild-valleyed and overlooked by the scowling buttresses of England’s highest mountains. The north-west is all jumbled, knuckled hills plunging to lake-floored vales. Then there’s the far north. There are no lakes here. No roads. Here the fells swoop and bulge, looking more Scottish than English. Unbroken by the gapes of crags, it’s Arctic-esque in the snow, pristine white rolling into white.You can lose yourself in 100 sq km or so. It is rampart-edged and slashed by valleys, with a high central keep. Caught within the encircling noose of roads are familiar fells – Skiddaw, Blencathra – and odd, unfamiliar names: Dead Crags, Thief Gill, Trusmadoor. It’s not impenetrable: the Cumbria Way splits on the way in, running around its centre like a moat. There’s even a bothy, in awesome isolation. I’d tell you where but no explorer wants directions.Hesket Newmarket lies to the north, a stone village with the Old Crown pub serving beers named after the local fells: Brim Fell, Old Carrock, High Pike.You couldn’t call any part of the Lakes a wilderness in itself. But by night, under cloud, or in winter, this is as wild a place as you’ll find. Simon Ingram, editor of Trail magazineLand’s End is one of the busiest places in Cornwall. Yet just a mile to the south along the South West Coast Path, and two miles north of popular Porthgwarra, is a bay of towering cliffs and caves that has two names: Nanjizal and Mill Bay. I love exploring this one-mile stretch of heathland and disused copper-mining shafts, along a mainly vertiginous footpath between two craggy granite promontories. These headlands are called Carn les Boel and Carn Boel, and the latter is my favourite, with remnants of an iron age settlement.Here I can be alone and observe seals, seabirds and peregrines rearing their young. On a clear day in May, you’re immersed in yellow gorse, orange lichen, aquamarine sea and the light and dark browns of granite glinting with feldspar. I often bring my walking guests to this bay, where we sit up high, on one side or the other of Carn les Boel, depending on the wind direction, watching the breaking waves with the sound reverberating around the bay. On extreme low tides, a walkable sand bar appears.Paul Simmons, founder of walkitcornwall.co.ukSprawled across the counties of Derry and Tyrone, the Sperrins are Ulster’s wildest land. The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak.Begin by following my favourite road through the foothills to Banagher Glen’s ancient forest of oak and ash. Here, having evaded St Patrick’s banishment, Ireland’s last serpent lurks in a pool swollen by the Altnaheglish and Glenedra burns. Climbing, the forest thins to mountain bog stretching across the uplands. The view pans to the Foyle Estuary. From Sawel, the highest peak in the range, you can gaze east all the way to the Mournes, and to Binevenagh on the north coast.Then turn around. There’s an aching wilderness of montane heath loping to the interior. With soaring buzzards to guide you, trek the lengths of eskers skirting peat-dark tarns and pools. If rough ground speckled with summer’s bog cotton keeps your eyes lowered, you’ll spy cloudberry and sundew among the coarse grasses and heather. But meadow pipit and wheatear will draw your gaze skyward to where a peregrine might slice it.Or you’ll stumble into the neolithic. Monuments, like Clogherny Wedge Tomb, cued by boulder erratics, litter the moorland with standing stones and circles. Heading west, past the Mullaghs, old bog roads descend to the glacial valleys of Glenelly and Owenkillew patchworked by gorse-seared hill-farms. Further pockets of forest shelter red squirrel and pine marten. As ravens acrobat in the wind, you could fancy you hear the howls of one of the last Irish wolves: mac tíre – aptly the son of the country – still haunting his tundral domain. Mary Montague, poet and author of Tribe (Dedalus Press, £9)If you want wild and remote, head to Handa, off the Sutherland coast. It’s not far from the North Coast 500 route, which is attracting growing numbers of visitors, but as an island we are one of the most isolated spots along this coastline. We look out of our bothy on to nothing, just mountains. Handa was last inhabited in 1847, when the islanders were relocated to Nova Scotia (voluntarily). Now it is an internationally important breeding site for seabirds, protected by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Much of the island is surrounded by spectacular sandstone cliffs, which provide nesting sites for fulmars, kittiwakes, one of the UK’s largest guillemot colonies and 200 pairs of puffins. But on the east side, there are pristine beaches and sand dunes. Inland, the boggy moorland is home to the great skua, or bonxie as it’s known here. Most people arrive by ferry from Tarbet on the mainland (April-Sept, handa-ferry.com) but it is possible to kayak over and wild camp – if you check with the rangers first. • scottishwildlifetrust.org.ukCraig Nisbet, ranger, Handa island Don’t be put off by images of people and trains chuffing up Snowdon – Snowdonia is one of Britain’s greatest wildernesses, second only to Scotland’s Cairngorms in size and emptiness. My favourite part is the northern Rhinogs, where I lived for many years, and which has rugged bony peaks, high tarns and glimpses of the Irish Sea. is an abundance of bronze age sites linked by a prehistoric track, recently christened the Ardudwy Way, that once connected Ireland to Britain via the natural harbours of the coast.Standing proud like a crown of thorns is Bryn Cader Faner, a spectacular stone circle thought to be a prince’s burial cairn. From here, a network of lakes and tarns spread out and buzzards soar around the lonely granite top of Moel Ysgyfarnogod, or hare mountain. The glacial Cwm Moch valley drives a scar to the north, descending into the precipitous gorge of Llennyrch, among some of finest examples of Atlantic rainforest in Europe. Mosses and lichen drape the sessile oaks, bilberries abound and walkers can bathe in a Narnia of waterfalls and pools.Daniel Start, co-author of Wild Guide to Wales and the Marches (Wild Things Publishing, out 1 May, £16.99)Between the stunning north Norfolk coast, a stone’s throw to the north, and the commercialised Norfolk Broads to the south, lies the best-kept secret in Norfolk: the Bure valley, with the beautiful river Bure meandering through it. The clear waters are home to numerous aquatic creatures, from shoal upon shoals of silvery darting fish to lobster-like crayfish crawling across the river bed. You may spot the iridescent flash of a kingfisher patrolling his “beat” and in search of his next meal, the unmistakable stream of fizzing bubbles as the elusive otter speeds off into the distance, or a Chinese water deer at the river’s edge.A footpath runs alongside the river for about nine miles from Aylesham to Coltishall, and the Bure Valley Steam railway roughly follows the same route, so you can walk one way and get the train back. Much of the river is privately owned so there are few boats on it, and it’s quite possible to canoe for two days and not see another soul. To have that tranquility just two hours from London is incredible.

Almost without exception, they have driven themselves headfirst into the ground. Our celebrity cookery shows have long since drowned in a morass of tweeness. Our cookery competitions are worse at this point MasterChef and The Great British Bake Off have become so crushingly repetitive that you may as well just watch a 15-second loop of someone staring at an oven. And then there’s Saturday Kitchen which, as ever, deserves to be tried as a witch and burned alive in a town square.But my disappointment with British food shows has led me to discover something quite exciting. On Netflix, nestled among concussed gameshows and masturbatory chef profiles, there is a rich vein of Asian food TV. These programmes have got their own patterns and rhythms, and ways of celebrating food, and I’m in deep. If you’re as bored as me with homegrown UK fare, here are the shows worth checking out.This will take some explaining, but it’s worth it. First, I want you to think of Dexter. Now, I want you to imagine that instead of being a serial killer, Dexter’s big secret is that he is aroused by puddings. And, instead of murder scenes, there are long sequences where Dexter visits a real-life pudding shop and narrates a long philosophical love letter to its most famous dish. He will wax lyrical about the ingredients and the presentation and the cultural importance of the pudding, while the pudding is presented in the same way that Top Gear presents supercars. Then he will take a bite and be transported into an intense hallucination, where all his co-workers have giant cherries for heads, or where he sits in a pudding floating through space, or where he embarks on an elaborate La La Land-style dance sequence about chestnuts. It is also worth pointing out that, unless I’ve got this very wrong, pudding literally makes him ejaculate. Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman is the weirdest thing that will ever make you hungry.Again, this one has a slightly bizarre premise – an old Japanese man asks an imaginary samurai to help him navigate his life problems – but if you push that to the side, you are left with a beautiful meditation on the joys of solo dining. In every episode, lead character Kasumi ends up ordering a dish in a different location. As he gently ponders on the meaning of life, we see the dish being lovingly prepared in the kitchen. It’s presented to him and he slowly describes what makes it so great. It is joyful, touching and innocent. There are no real stakes to speak of, but that is part of its charm.“My diner is open from midnight to seven in the morning,” murmurs the Master, owner of a tiny 12-seat restaurant. “Do I even have customers? More than you’d expect.” He has a few rules – nobody can have more than three drinks and all fights have to be taken outside – but he will try to cook whatever you ask for. Every episode tells the story of a different customer and how their lives intersect with the dish they order. At the end of each episode, they will often break the fourth wall to offer tips on preparation. That’s all there is to it, but Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories is just as woozy and narcoleptic as you would imagine.Much more traditional is this nutso South Korean cookery show, the conceit of which revolves around packing up and shipping a celebrity’s refrigerator wholesale to the studio. The hosts then mock the celebrity for the state of the fridge, and the contents are handed to a squadron of chefs, who attempt to create a dish from them in 15 minutes. It’s Ready Steady Cook, basically, but also aggressively Korean. “What are the parameters of chastity?” one guest is casually asked in episode three."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de03e30848280398bb5db0a62a717679b709f0b5/0_184_4356_2614/master/4356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f4d0464fe2fa8ca33b7cee30e84d40b 1240w","title":"us syria arab force replace american troops saudi arabia egypt uae","story":"Saudis confirm government is talking to Washington about raising such a force but plan faces obstacles and could worsen Syrian conflictThe Trump administration is renewing an effort to replace US troops in Syria with an Arab force, but the proposal faces substantial obstacles and could potentially exacerbate the conflict.The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government was talking to Washington about raising such a force, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal that said the new US national security adviser, John Bolton, had called the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to ask Cairo to play a part in building one.There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria fighting Islamic State, but Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw them.The idea of an Arab coalition force playing a role in Syria to combat extremist groups and contain Iranian influence has surfaced several times since 2015, but faces severe problems. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are bogged down in a brutal war in Yemen, and have little manpower and few military resources to spare. They are also locked in a dispute with Qatar, another potential contributor to a force, while Egypt is much closer to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria than its would-be Gulf partners. Middle East experts said it was feasible Arab states could fund an army run by private contractors and possibly help recruit soldiers from developing countries such as Sudan. Erik Prince, a Trump ally who founded the military contractor Blackwater USA and now advises the UAE, is lobbying to play a role, according to the Wall Street Journal. A similar offer he made last year to replace US troops with private contractors in Afghanistan was turned down by the Pentagon.But Prince may have more traction in the White House over Syria. Bolton has argued that the US has taken too much of the military burden in Syria and Arab states should supply troops and material assistance in the fight against Isis.Meanwhile, the Saudi monarchy and its regional allies are uneasy that events on the ground in Syria are being dictated by external powers, none of which are Arab.Emile Hokayem, the senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The idea of an Arab expeditionary force emerges every couple of years, and it’s always seen as a politically brilliant idea to create a sense of ownership in the region.“In reality, the politics of putting a force like that together are almost impossible.“The question is: have the Saudis consulted the other countries before speaking on their behalf? The Saudis thought Egypt and Pakistan would come to help Yemen and they didn’t.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an Islamic military counter-terrorism coalition, which held its first high-level meeting last year, but it has not appeared to be intended for combat.Charles Lister, the director of the extremism and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute (MEI), attended the inaugural conference and said the force was intended for training and assistance programmes, rather than combat operations.Lister said there was “no precedent” for an Arab expeditionary force in Syria. Any Saudi troops deployed to Syria would find themselves directly confronting Iranian fighters and their allies, which could prompt a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Randa Slim, who directs the back-channel Track II diplomacy programme at MEI said: “It is one thing for the Saudis to pay for other ‘Islamic forces’ to do the job, and a totally different thing to send their men to a conflict theatre where they are bound to enter into direct confrontation with an entrenched Iranian-Hezbollah force.“The other factor to consider is: what is Turkey’s response to this proposal? I do not see Ankara welcoming the positions of Egyptian andor Emirati forces on its border,” Slim said. The Obama administration also looked at the possibility of Arab allies deploying counter-terrorist forces against Isis in Syria, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE were drawn into the battle for Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said: “They preferred to send intelligence officers and money, rather than put troops on the ground.“But for the Saudis, the trouble is their territory is being breached by Houthis every day. It doesn’t make sense for them to shift their ground forces when they have trouble securing their own border.”Heras said it was more likely Saudi Arabia would seek to outsource recruitment to countries such as Pakistan and Sudan. “I’m sure the Saudis are up for fighting in Syria to the very last Sudanese soldier,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98891e901d46f226d261d44df70e7bb3334bbe9c/0_27_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2aaf1b102f5daf3013d7d880ca4cd9e7 1240w","title":"southwest 1380 engine emergency landing passengers pilot","story":"Retired nurse gave Jennifer Riordan CPR after she was partially sucked out of a window, while captain discussed landing with officials Terrified passengers struggled in vain to save the life of the woman who was partially sucked head-first out of the window of a Southwest Airlines flight, it emerged on Wednesday. A retired nurse who gave the woman CPR for 20 minutes as the jet descended rapidly, with passengers screaming behind emergency oxygen masks, said afterwards: “There were a lot of really heroic and thoughtful things that went on during the flight. I was very proud of everyone involved.”The pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, a former fighter jet pilot in the US navy, was described as displaying “nerves of steel” as she brought the aircraft in to land in Philadelphia. A preliminary examination of the jet engine that broke up and threw debris into the fuselage, breaking a window, showed evidence of “metal fatigue”, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. On Tuesday afternoon, a huge bang rocked the flight en route from New York to Dallas. Moments later, as the aircraft ed and shook vigorously, metal that had sheared off was flung clear of the engine casing, which is supposed to contain debris in such a situation, and broke the window.Jennifer Riordan, a New Mexico bank executive and mother of two, was sucked out as far as the waist as the cabin rapidly depressurised, passengers later reported. Several men grabbed hold of Riordan and managed to bring her back into the plane, but she was gravely injured and witnesses recalled the men’s hands being covered in her blood. Peggy Phillips, a retired registered nurse, told a local ABC news station she heard “a big whoosh of air”. Then she responded to a call for someone who could perform resuscitation.  “If you can possibly imagine going through the window of an airplane at about 600mph and hitting either the fuselage or the wing with your body, with your face, then I think I can probably tell you there was significant trauma,” Phillips said of Riordan. Passengers laid Riordan in the aisle and Phillips continued to perform CPR even as the plane descended fast and came in for a hard landing. Some passengers reported thinking they were going to die and many texted goodbyes to relatives and friends.“I thought, OK, this might be it,” said Phillips. After landing, Shults, the captain, walked through the cabin and thanked all the passengers, asking them if they were all right. “She has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,” said Alfred Tumlinson, a passenger from Corpus Christi, Texas. “I’m going to send her a Christmas card … she was awesome. Unknown to the passengers at the time, Shults had remained absolutely calm as she attempted to save the jet, as revealed by her communications with air traffic control (ATC), captured in a recording. “Southwest 1380 has an engine fire. Descending,” she tells ATC in a monotone. “You are descending right now?” an incredulous voice on the other end says. A voice asks her where she would like to land. With just the faintest hint of exasperation, Shults replies: “Give us the closest … we are looking at Philly.” The communications continue calmly, as the captain tells ATC she has injured passengers and relays from her cabin crew: “They said there is a hole and someone went out.” After landing, Shults tells the ATC personnel: “Thanks, guys, for the help.” Diana McBride Self, a passenger, thanked Shults on Facebook for her “guidance and bravery in a traumatic situation”. “This is a true American Hero,” McBride wrote. Others on social media agreed and compared Shults with Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who guided his US Airways plane to safety in New York’s Hudson river in 2009 after birds flew into the engines after take off. When contacted by the Washington Post, Shults declined to be interviewed. But family told how she had battled from the late 70s onward, against almost blanket refusal from the military, to become a fighter pilot, eventually succeeding. She was among the first female fighter pilots for the US navy, according to her alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene University, from which she graduated in 1983, and among the first women to fly an FA-18 Hornet for the navy. Her mother-in-law, Virginia Shults, said that as soon as she heard the pilot’s voice on the radio transmission online, she said, “That is Tammie Jo.” “It was just as if she and I were sitting here talking,” Virginia Shults told the Washington Post. “She’s a very calming person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8651caf0f1aa35248769cb301615521d310bc0/0_172_5103_3062/master/5103.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b03cb00d4cf9a4acd11015879787a02f 1240w","title":"caribou south selkirk us canada extinction","story":"Experts fear only three of South Selkirk herd, which moves from Canada into Idaho and Washington, survived winter – all femaleThe last remaining herd of caribou to roam the contiguous United States is believed to be on the brink of disappearing, after an aerial count suggested that only three members survived the winter – all of them female.The South Selkirk herd were once part of a larger population of southern mountain caribou whose habitat ned much of the Pacific Northwest. But human activity – from hunting to logging and snowmobiling – has forced the population to break off into small herds.By 2009, the Selkirk herd was estimated to have about 50 members, living in an ecosystem that stretched from British Columbia to Washington and Idaho.Seven years later that number had dwindled to 12, despite decades of efforts to save them. This week, biologists with the provincial government of British Columbia suggested just three members of the herd remained.“In the absence of extreme measures, the herd is functionally lost,” said Candace Batycki of the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. “There are only three females remaining – we don’t know if any of them are pregnant. It’s a pretty dire situation.”For decades conservationists have worked to bolster the Selkirk herd’s numbers by transplanting other caribou into the herd, controversially culling wolves and banning logging and snowmobiling along large swaths of the herd’s range.It wasn’t enough. “It’s one of those things that’s a shock but not a surprise,” said Batycki, whose organisation is calling for an immediate moratorium on industrial activity in the southern mountain caribou’s critical habitat.“This herd was kind of besieged, if you will, for decades. When you get down to a dozen or fewer animals, maybe it’s just one avalanche that takes most of them out. They’re just so vulnerable at that point.”Weighing as much as 600lbs, mountain caribou feed on a slow-growing lichen that relies on centuries-old trees to develop, putting them at odds with the settlers who first chopped down old-growth forests to develop the land, and later, the logging industry.“We’ve really jeopardised their habitat over the last 30 to 40 years through unsustainable rates of logging,” said Mark Hebblewhite, a Canadian wildlife biologist at the University of Montana. “It’s all about habitat. You can do everything you want you can kill wolves, you can kill invasive predators, you can kill species like moose … but without habitat what you’re doing is just buying time.”He said the loss of the Selkirk herd was an example of the failure of the Endangered Species Act in the US, catapulting Canada into its first major test of its international commitments to protect bioersity.“The bigger picture is that this is happening across Canada,” Hebblewhite said, citing caribou populations that have effectively disappeared in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta in recent years.“This is really the legacy of 30 years of mismanagement of habitat and that we will continue to see more and more extirpations unless both the provincial and federal governments actually get a bit more serious about caribou conservation.” A recent estimate by Canadian officials suggested the number of southern mountain caribou in the country now hovers around 3,800, down from 5,800 in 2014.While British Columbia ranks among the provinces that is doing the most to protect caribou, what they are doing is far from enough, Hebblewhite said. “That’s how big the problem is. We’ve logged a lot of these places so much that it’s going to take a long time for these forests to turn back into caribou habitat,” he added. “And continuing to log just undermines everything else they’re doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230bc025b53c27dedb0f6011412735d3e2a6d82b/0_223_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a43bb2ca43881e9a32568e01c6c664e0 1240w","title":"island of no return vanuatu evacuates entire population of volcanic ambae","story":"Thousands of south Pacific islanders will leave for permanent resettlement, government says, as Manaro spews ash 30cm deepThousands of south Pacific islanders at the mercy of an active volcano will be permanently resettled by the end of May, the Vanuatu government has said.Ambae Island is home to 11,000 people, and for the second time in six months Ambae’s Manaro volcano on top of Mount Lombenben has started rumbling, spewing torrents of ash and gas from its crater and burying vegetable plots and crops, causing breathing and health problems for locals, and threatening their lives and livelihoods.People living in the north, west and south of the island are worst affected by the ash and began being evacuated on Thursday after a state of emergency was declared on Tuesday. Ash as deep as 30cm had already settled on many parts of the island, and people were experiencing breathing difficulties, skin reactions and illnesses such as chest infections as they waited to leave.One Ambae resident, Nadia Kanegai, said islanders were frightened and could not wait to get away. “And there was a gas emission as well. So the people are scared.”A local priest said the situation was “desperate” for locals as food supplies and animal feed were beginning to run out, water was contaminated by ash and disease was spreading among the evacuees, most of whom are subsistence farmers.Police and some aid agencies are already in place, with the army expected to arrive later this week to orchestrate the mass evacuation which this times looks to be permanent. “In times like these, it is always the vulnerable sections of our communities being the women, the children and the elderly, that are most affected,” Avio Roberts, national coordinator for the Vanua’aku party, told the Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper.Negotiations are under way between landowners and central government to acquire land for Ambae evacuees on either Maewo or Pentecost – the two closest islands to Ambae, but a safe distance from the volcano, which is one of the most active in the world.“People’s lives must be our first priority,” said prime minister Charlot Salwai during the October evacuation, in which planes, ships and barges were used in the DIY effort.Vanuatu is no stranger to natural disasters, and the the south Pacific nation was rated the most at-risk country in the world in a 2016 UN study. Its 83 islands are stuck in the middle of hurricane alley and they dot the border of the “ring of fire” – a belt around the Pacific prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The Australian government provided AU$3.2m to support early recovery efforts for those affected by the Ambae volcano last year, and is ready to give further assistance, a spokesperson said. The New Zealand government has provided more than NZ$1.5m in assistance, as well as technical support and relief supplies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5105cae0c3cbac3e1e92dac5343a94f820bef3ea/5_0_2082_1250/master/2082.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ca648dce8fd1bc671e00dc27ab8b54f 1240w","title":"miguel diaz canel cuba selects first non castro president in 60 years","story":"Díaz-Canel’s transition aims to ensure the country’s single-party system outlasts the ageing men who created itThe Cuban government has selected the country’s 57-year-old first vice-president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed President Raúl Castro in a transition aimed at ensuring the country’s single-party system outlasts the ageing revolutionaries who created it.The certain approval of Díaz-Canel by members of the unfailingly unanimous National Assembly will install someone from outside the Castro family at the head of the country’s government office for the first time in nearly six decades.The 86-year-old Castro will remain head of the Communist party, designated by the constitution as “the superior guiding force of society and the state”. As a result, Castro will remain the most powerful person in Cuba for the time being. His departure from the presidency is nonetheless a symbolically charged moment for a country accustomed to 60 years of absolute rule first by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and, for the last decade, his younger brother.Facing biological reality but still active and apparently healthy, Raúl Castro is stepping down as president in an effort to guarantee new leaders can maintain the government’s grip on power in the face of economic stagnation, an ageing population and increasing disenchantment among younger generations.“I like sticking with the ideas of President Fidel Castro because he did a lot for the people of Cuba, but we need rejuvenation, above all in the economy,” said Melissa Mederos, a 21-year-old schoolteacher. “Díaz-Canel needs to work hard on the economy, because people need to live a little better.”“We’re building a relationship between the government and the people here,” Díaz-Canel said after casting a ballot for members of the National Assembly. “The lives of those who will be elected have to be focused on relating to the people, listening to the people, investigating their problems and encouraging debate.”Díaz-Canel gained prominence in central Villa Clara province as the top Communist party official, a post equivalent to governor. There, people described him as a hard-working, modest-living technocrat dedicated to improving public services. He became higher education minister in 2009 before moving into the vice presidency.In a video of a Communist party meeting that leaked to the public last year, Díaz-Canel expressed a series of orthodox positions that included pledging to shut some independent media and labelling some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversion.But he has also defended academics and bloggers who became targets of hardliners, leading some to describe him a potential advocate for greater openness in a system intolerant of virtually any criticism or dissent. International observers and Cubans alike will be scrutinising every move he makes after he officially takes office on Thursday.Two years after taking over from his ailing brother in 2006, Castro launched a series of reforms that expanded Cuba’s private sector to nearly 600,000 people and allowed citizens greater freedom to travel and access to information. He has failed to fix the generally unproductive and highly subsidised state-run businesses that, along with a Soviet-model bureaucracy, employ three of every four Cubans. State salaries average $30 a month, leaving workers struggling to feed their families, and often dependent on corruption or remittances from relatives overseas.Castro’s moves to open the economy have largely been frozen or reversed as soon as they began to generate conspicuous shows of wealth by the new entrepreneurial class in a country officially dedicated to equality among its citizens.“I don’t want to see a capitalist system, hopefully that doesn’t come here, but we have to fix the economy,” said Roberto Sanchez, a 41-year-old construction worker. “I’d like to have more opportunity, to buy a car and have a few possessions.”State media went into overdrive on Wednesday with a single message: Cuba’s system is continuing in the face of change. Commentators on state television and online offered lengthy explanations of why Cuba’s single-party politics and socialist economy are superior to multi-party democracy and free markets.Fidel Castro was president from 1976 until he fell ill in 2006, having previously led the country since the 1959 revolution as prime minister. Osvaldo Dorticos was president from 1959 to 1976 but was considered a figurehead beside the man who forged Cuba’s single-party socialist system and ruled by fiat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c4a2067532001b5fd823d044fdda0fb84c9f28/0_214_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=72b8e1f96d9a950f5cdadc5c6362fb87 1240w","title":"recep tayyip erdogan turkey president election dictator seeks total control","story":"Turkey’s president is unlikely to lose an election that will make him more powerful than AtatürkRecep Tayyip Erdoğan is one of a crop of present-day political leaders who value the respectability an ostensibly democratic election confers but don’t want to risk actually losing the vote.In this respect, Turkey’s president is no different from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Their shared idea of democracy can be summed up by the motto: “You vote, I win.” It is possible Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could lose the snap presidential and parliamentary polls called for 24 June. But it is extremely unlikely. The AKP won a clear majority of seats in parliament in 2015 and is already assured of the support, should it need it, of the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspErdoğan has sidelined old comrades such as Abdullah Gül and Ahmet Davutoğlu, formerly president and prime minister respectively, ensuring nobody within the AKP is in a position to rival him. And since the failed 2016 coup, he has systemically emasculated rival power bases and independent media, locking up pro-Kurdish lawmakers and journalists and sacking tens of thousands of civil servants, academics, military, police and judges on specious grounds of national security.In such circumstances, the prospect of truly competitive, open, free and fair elections is slim to non-existent. In a very real sense, Erdoğan, himself a one-time prison inmate who came up the hard way, has been waiting for this moment all his life. If and when he wins, he will assume the full powers of the new “executive presidency” that was narrowly voted through in last year’s bitterly contested constitutional referendum.Elections had not been due for another 18 months. By bringing the polls forward, Erdoğan is finally set to gain full, personal control of all key aspects of domestic and foreign policy. He will become a dictator in all but name, more powerful perhaps than even Kemal Atatürk, modern, secular Turkey’s founding father. Worried politicians in Paris, Berlin, London and Washington no longer see a reliable friend and ally in Ankara. They see an autocratic figure exploiting nationalist and neo-Islamist sentiment, xenophobia and Europhobia, and feelings of public insecurity brought on by next door’s Syrian crisis, to justify egregious human rights abuses, institutional vandalism and anti-EU, anti-western policies.Turkey under Erdoğan, though still a Nato member, is now closely aligned with Russia. In Syria, Erdoğan has backed Moscow and Tehran in pursuing a political and territorial settlement that would keep Bashar al-Assad’s regime in place, even though he had previously demanded the Syrian leader resign.In return, Moscow gave tacit support to Turkey’s recent military incursion into Afrin, in north-west Syria, in furtherance of Erdoğan’s obsessive vendetta with the Syrian (and Iraqi) Kurds – all of whom he denounces as terrorists. On past precedent, inflammatory anti-Kurdish rhetoric will play a big part in Erdoğan’s re-election bid. The need to be “strong” in Afrin was one reason for calling early polls, he said on Wednesday. Putin and, for example, China’s Xi Jinping, another executive president-forever, may be impressed by Erdoğan’s dubious ascendancy. Iran’s hardliners may cheer him on. But the western democracies, which Turks for many years aspired to emulate, will not. For them, Turkey is increasingly on the wrong side of a global argument between freedom and control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a6e1f073ae15c28862716aca445646fb79233ee/0_23_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5758c3e777ae8122a389f556715b2000 1240w","title":"southwest explosion aviation authority orders mass engine inspections","story":"Directive requires ultrasonic inspection of fan blades on CFM56-7B engines that accrued certain number of flightsThe US Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the inspection of 220 jet engines after investigators said a broken fan blade touched off an engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines flight, shattering a window and killing a passenger. The order, called an air-worthiness directive, would require an ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of flights. The CFM56 engine on Southwest flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York’s LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board.The explosion sent shrapnel ripping into the fuselage of the Boeing 737-700 plane and shattered a window. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a bank executive, was killed when she was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat in row 14 as the cabin suffered rapid decompression. Fellow passengers were able to pull her back inside but she died of her injuries later on Tuesday. On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt told a news conference the incident began when one of the engine’s 24 fan blades snapped off from its hub. Sumwalt said investigators found the blade had suffered metal fatigue at the site of the break. Sumwalt said he could not yet say if the incident, the first deadly airline accident in the US since 2009, pointed to a fleet-wide issue in the Boeing 737-700. “We want to very carefully understand what was the result of this problem, and as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I’m very concerned about this particular event,” he said. “To be able to extrapolate that to the entire fleet, I’m not willing to do that right now.”Southwest crews were inspecting similar engines – made by a partnership of France’s Safran and General Electric – the airline had in service, focusing on the 400 to 600 oldest, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It was the second time that style of engine had failed on a Southwest jet in the past two years, prompting airlines around the world to step up inspections.An NTSB inspection crew was also combing over the Boeing 737-700 for signs of what caused the engine to explode. Sumwalt said the fan blade, after suffering metal fatigue where it attached to the engine hub, suffered a second fracture about halfway along its length. Pieces of the plane were found in rural Pennsylvania by investigators who tracked them on radar. The metal fatigue would not have been observable by looking at the engine from the outside, he said. The jet was traveling at 190 miles per hour when it made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International airport, according to Sumwalt, much faster than the typical 155-mile-per-hour touchdown.Passengers described scenes of panic as a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a plane window, almost sucking Riordan out. “The window had broken and the negative pressure had pulled her outside the plane partially,” Peggy Phillips, a registered nurse who was on the plane, told WFAA-TV in Dallas. “Two wonderful men ... they managed to get her back inside the plane, and we laid her down and we started CPR.” Riordan was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company said. Videos posted on social media showed passengers grabbing for oxygen masks and screaming as the plane, piloted by 56-year-old Tammie Jo Shults, a former US navy fighter pilot, prepared for the descent. “All I could think of in that moment was, I need to communicate with my loved ones,” passenger Marty Martinez told ABC’s Good Morning America on Wednesday. During the incident, he logged on to the in-flight Wi-Fi to send messages to his family. “I thought, these are my last few moments on Earth and I want people to know what happened,” said Martinez, who live-streamed images of passengers in oxygen masks as the plane made a bumpy descent. The airline expected to wrap up its inspection of the engines it was targeting in about 30 days. The GE-Safran partnership that built the engine said it was sending about 40 technicians to help with inspections. The investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the FAA to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bcf1d8cd46bc87b234e25bf5e79366c5a4373b/36_248_3670_2202/master/3670.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0bc76b1490ab8e1234260e9bffb50437 1240w","title":"taste the difference farm to fork movement takes off in urban flanders","story":"The densely populated area of Belgium is seeing a mini-boom in model of farming where growers sell direct to consumers Flanders, famed for its medieval cities and motorways that can be seen from space, is one of the most urban corners of Europe. Yet this densely populated area is seeing a mini-boom in a new type of agriculture where farmers sell direct to consumers.The movement, known as community-supported agriculture, is the antithesis of the sprawling global distribution chains of modern industrial food production. CSA farming means no supermarkets, no fertilisers and no monoculture.Advocates say the most important feature is the direct link to consumers, who pay upfront and often pick the produce from the fields.This model of farming – sometimes referred to as farm-to-fork – originated in the United States and the Netherlands, but has quickly taken off in the Belgian region of Flanders. More people are eating CSA-grown food in Belgium than in the more populous UK, according to a 2016 report by Urgenci, the international CSA network.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comSince the first Flemish CSA farmer struck his spade into the soil in 2007, at least 45 similar businesses have sprung up in the region.Koen Tierens, a plant biologist, is one of the newest on the scene. Tierens swapped his desk job as an agrarian expert for the 5.30am harvests that come with running his own vegetable farm. He has a 1.2-hectare (2.96-acre) plot in the village of Kampenhout just outside Brussels, where the rich, loamy soil is ideal for growing.Tierens’ father, a retired farmer, was sceptical when he outlined his plans a small holding, no fertilisers and a few old-fashioned, second-hand tools: “My father told me, ‘Koen what are you doing? You studied at university, you have a PhD! Are you going to be an ancient Belgian farmer doing how they did it in the middle ages?’”He grows 200 varieties of vegetable in a year – a much wider range than typical farmers. As well as the more common peas, carrots and potatoes, he grows less familiar varieties – purple cauliflowers, green zebra tomatoes, black radish, salsify and cardoon. But Tierens does not grow Belgian ene, the most emblematic vegetable in the national cuisine. Although he farms in a region that is famed for the bitter white lettuce, he decided it would be arrogant to grow his fellow farmers’ best-known crop.Another big difference with conventional farming is the limited use of subsidies, although he received EU funds to start his business and cover the costs of gaining organic certification.Other things are constant – the unpredictability of the weather and early starts. Tierens works in his field every day, wearing a head torch on dark winter mornings. During the peak growing season from May to October, he works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week. His customers share the risk of a storm or a bad harvest. “It would be a disaster for them as well, but the chance of that happening is not that big because I grow 200 types of vegetables,” he says.Belgium is an enthusiastic latecomer to CSA farming, which traces its roots to the biodynamic movement launched in the US in the 1980s. But there were other inspirations. The first known CSA farm in Europe was Les Jardins de Cocagne, an organic vegetable cooperative near Geneva founded in 1978. Japanese farmers were experimenting with similar models at around the same time. “It is not only about the food, it is also about the community and being outside,” says Nele Lauwers, a policy adviser at the Flemish farming union Boerenbond. She belongs to a CSA cooperative near Ghent and describes harvesting days as “a weekly outdoor trip” for her children.Demand for pick-your-own vegetables is growing among medium to high earners, she says. But price may limit its appeal. “It’s quite a different market. You have to pay in advance and it is not possible for everybody, although some CSA groups may offer social prices.”The Flemish government has agreed a ban on new urban development from 2040 unless an equivalent area of land is returned to nature.Another feature of CSA produce is that it takes longer to prepare. Vegetables arrive in customers’ kitchens with earth clinging to roots and leaves, rather than shiny and neat in plastic packaging. “Not everyone likes to bring soil into their kitchen,” says Tierens. “With me you need to invest a little bit more time, but you can taste the difference.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466164.1524076758!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more staff absences in health than any other sector","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe main illness experienced by health workers is due to musculoskeletal disorders. Stress, anxiety and depression are  also more common illnesses.The health sector has the highest rate of work absences as a result of injury and illness, new research has found. These rates climbed during the recession when absences in other sectors dropped. Some of the increases may be explained by the fact job growth continued in the health sector even after the economic collapse – an experience opposite to that of other areas of employment. Detailed reports compiled by the Economic and Social Research Unit (ESRI) and the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) examined work-related injuries and illness in five sectors between 2001 and 2014. The analysis drew on the self-reported experiences of workers as part of the Central Statistics Office’s (CSO) quarterly national household surveys. It looked at those who work in the areas of health construction industry, including manufacturing and utilities transport and storage and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Overall, the health sector was found to have the highest amount of work absences. Some of the increase in injury and illness-related absences in health could have been a result of rising employment. It had about a quarter of a million employees between 2013 and 2014, and was “one of the few sectors to show positive employment growth throughout the 2000s, even during the severe recession”. During the boom period of 2001 to 2007, it accounted for 10.1 per cent of total employment, rising to 12.9 per cent during the recession, and again to 13.1 per cent during between 2012 and 2014. The main illness experienced by health workers was due to musculoskeletal disorders – which typically occur in tendons, muscles, joints and blood vessels or nerves in the limbs and back. These accounted for about 46 per cent of cases, similar to other sectors which recorded a 47 per cent rate. Stress, anxiety and depression were also more common illnesses in health (22 per cent) than in other types of employment (16 per cent). Rates of work-related illness in the health sector were “significantly higher in the boom”, at 4 per cent, compared to the recession, at 2.8 per cent, the research found. “Overall, there has been a rising trend of injury and illness in the health sector since 2010,” it said. “Self-employed health workers who may be well-educated and in professional occupation have a lower rate of both injury and illness.” This cohort includes GPs and physiotherapists. Work-related fatalities were highest in the agriculture, forest and fishing industries. The five sectors measured by the reports accounted for 41 per cent of employment in Ireland in 2014, and 56 per cent of all work place injuries. Helen Russell, research professor at the ESRI, said that while the improving economy was creating employment growth this could bring its own issues. “Our research shows that new recruits in construction, health, agriculture and transport have a significantly higher risk of occupational injury,” she said. “Hence, there is need for supervision, training and support to prevent rising injury and illness rates.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Sex education in Ireland \u0026lsquoin the dark ages\u0026rsquo says Solidarity TD Paul MurphyBody found in Orient Gardens on Wednesday as police call for witnesses to come forwardIrish TimesIpsos MRBI poll findings mark end of encouraging run for Taoiseach and his partyBy the numbers: a total of 1,478 attacks by patients on staff in mental units in 2017Buckley told O\u0026rsquoBrien merger would typically be approved after competition clearanceMessage was sent to Leslie Buckley and then forwarded to Denis O\u0026rsquoBrienMinister says he \u0026lsquoacted to the letter of the law\u0026rsquo in his conversation with lobbyist Eoghan \u0026Oacute NeachtainWork-related injuries and illness greatest among health employees, research findsState Examinations Commission confirms some students affected by scheduling clashManager of Tallaght centre says \u0026lsquopoor now have to compete with the poor for scraps\u0026rsquoDrivers accept process which allows operation of 10-minute Dart serviceFormer EC secretary general Catherine Day says EU will continue to enlargeMinister faces questions in D\u0026aacuteil over information he provided about INM acquisitionGarda\u0026iacute are investigating incident on the N11 at the junction with Greenfield ParkSF leader says it was not appropriate for Naughten to relay his opinion to \u0026Oacute NeachtainLabour\u0026rsquos Brendan Howlin says Ireland \u0026lsquoalmost unique\u0026rsquo in not having such a bodyUHW is only designated emergency cardiac centre not offering 247 cover \u0026ndash lobby groupSenator Frances Black witnesses old people crying in pain and for their loved onesPOA wants action on assaults by prisoners, not \u0026lsquohugging philosophy\u0026rsquo from managersThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466275.1524084930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu might integrate more smoothly once permanently reluctant uk leaves","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWill the EU Survive Brexit?: former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day gave the Barrett Family Lecture at Newman University Church. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Union might integrate more smoothly after Brexit, once it no longer has a “permanently reluctant member in the room”, the former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day has said.Speaking at Newman University Church in Dublin, where she gave the Barrett Family Lecture 2018, Ms Day said that she saw “no room to hope” the UK would change its mind about leaving the European Union. But she also said that she saw no “domino effect” and that Europe would continue to enlarge, taking in countries in the Balkans “one or two at a time”.In the absence of the UK, she predicted in Will the EU Survive Brexit?, the “euro and Europe” would become synonymous, with smaller states that had resisted the single currency now being “pushed” into joining it. She also said that security and defence were “an area where Europe would have to step up to the plate”. Although most states would remain in Nato, “economies of scale” in European defence forces could deliver similar “boots and helicopters”.Ms Day told the audience, many of whom were students of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies at the University of Notre Dame, the steward of the church, that Brexit could ultimately be good for relations between Britain and Ireland, as Britain seeks an external relationship with the EU. “It is just that we need a bit more enlightenment in certain parts of London for that to happen.”She said in many ways the EU had not played fair with Turkey, keeping it “dangling” for 40 years. But she added that there were many things to consider, including that Turkey would become the unions’s largest member state on entry and that some countries would raise the issue of Christian and Muslim differences. Of the future of the EU, she said, “It may not last 1,000 years, but it will be here for a long time to come.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466289.1524086392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pressure on varadkar to offer view on naughten s explanation","story":"Minister for Communications Denis Naughten has denied that he misled the Dáil in his December 2016 statement on the purposed purchase of Celtic Media by INM. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Minister for Communications,  Denis Naughten, making a statement in the Dáil on WednesdayTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to be pressed on the Minister for Communications’s statement that he only offered a “personal view” to a lobbyist for Independent News and Media on a proposed takeover.In a statement to the Dáil on Wednesday, Denis Naughten said he “acted to the letter of the law” when he had a conversation with lobbyist Eoghan Ó Neachtain in November 2016 about the mooted takeover of Celtic Media by INM. He also insisted he had “no inside information” to give. The Irish Times reported on Wednesday details from court documents filed by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as part of a bid to have High Court inspectors appointed to INM. These referred to the Ó Neachtain conversation with Mr Naughten over whether the takeover would likely be referred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI). This was allegedly relayed to Denis O’Brien, INM’s largest shareholder, two months before a decision was made. Mr Naughten said he “expressed a purely personal view that the likely course of action” would be a referral to the BAI. The proposed takeover of Celtic Media was abandoned last July.Fianna Fáil communications spokesman Timmy Dooley said the party “will not rush to judgment” on the issue. “But the Minister gave a nod to INM, and in this instance a nod is as good as a wink. We need to hear from the Taoiseach on this. The Taoiseach needs to explain if he thinks it is acceptable for a Minister to personally indicate how he might later act as Minister.” A Sinn Féin spokesman also said the party would ask Mr Varadkar if he was happy with Mr Naughten offering a personal view on a matter under his remit to a lobbyist working for an interested party. However, a spokesman for Mr Varadkar said the Taoiseach was satisfied with the explanation given by Mr Naughten on Wednesday. Last night at a Fine Gael event in Dublin the Taoiseach said Mr Naughten’s explanation was “clear”. During a question-and-answer session in the Dáil after he made his statement, Mr Naughten said no official record of the phone call with Mr Ó Neachtain had been kept. He also said he spoke to former INM chairman Leslie Buckley at a company event in May 2017, but they had only engaged in small talk.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Former Independent News \u0026amp Media chairman Leslie Buckley told the company’s biggest shareholder Denis O’Brien that the decision to refer the company’s proposed takeover of Celtic Media Group to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland after being cleared by the competition regulator was unprecedented.Mr Buckley, then INM chairman, texted Mr O’Brien on January 12th, 2017, after Minister for Communications Denis Naughten officially announced he was referring the takeover to the BAI, two months after they first learned of his intention through a private telephone conversation he had with an INM lobbyist.Explaining his account of the telephone call and referral, Mr Naughten told the Dáil yesterday he had expressed “a purely personal view” in conversation with the lobbyist Eoghan Ó Neachtain – on a phone call on either November 10th or 11th, 2016 – that his “likely course of action” would be to refer the takeover “in light of the scale of the proposed acquisition”. Mr Naughten said that there was “nothing wrong or inappropriate” with him saying to “anyone or to the public that if the plan for the merger continued I would take advice on sending it to the BAI”. Two months later, Mr Buckley thought the referral to the BAI was unusual.He told Mr O’Brien in the text message that the takeover was “cleared by the competition authority and normally on that basis the Minister would just sign”.“This is the first time that having been approved by the competition authority that it is referred to the BAI,” Mr Buckley added.Referring to BAI chief executive Michael O’Keeffe, Mr Buckley told Mr O’Brien he thought Mr O’Keeffe was “the type of guy that won’t be pushed around”.Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan has claimed Mr Buckley’s text was one of nine communications from Mr Buckley to Mr O’Brien in which he shared information that may be defined as “inside information” relating to a public company and, as a result, that he may have breached stock market rules. Legal papers filed by Mr Drennan in his bid to seek the appointment of High Court inspectors to INM reveal confidential contacts between various parties, including Mr Naughten, with interests in the merger. Mr Naughten made a lengthy statement to the Dáil in response to The Irish Times revealing yesterday that Mr Drennan raised significant concerns about communications, including Mr Buckley’s sharing the Minister’s plans for the takeover with Mr O’Brien from the Ó Neachtain telephone call. Mr Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times yesterday that he “did not disagree with a word that was said by the Minister” in the Dáil.The Minister told the Dáil that Mr Ó Neachtain, a former government press secretary, phoned him in advance of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) telling the Minister that it would not be blocking the deal.Mr Ó Neachtain told this newspaper this week that he was hired by INM to find out the Minister’s reaction to that decision and to see if he intended to refer the deal to the BAI. He stressed he was not lobbying for the Minister’S approval.Mr Drennan’s affidavit says Nigel Heneghan, managing director of the PR firm where Mr Ó Neachtain works, shared details of the November telephone call with the Minister in an email to Mr Buckley at 9.36am the next day.Mr Heneghan wrote that the Minister said that based on the advice of his officials he would refer the deal to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for review because of the level of cross-media ownership by Denis O’Brien, INM’s biggest shareholder.Mr Heneghan told Buckley the information was “highly confidential as the Minister has not been officially informed yet of the CCPC decision.” Mr Buckley forwarded the email to Mr O’Brien at 10.07am, the Drennan affidavit shows.Despite Mr Naughten flagging his likely plans to Mr Ó Neachtain, the Minister told The Irish Times in an interview 12 days later that he had not yet looked at the deal. He told the Dáil on December 6th, 2016, he had not yet made a decision. Mr Naughten told the Dáil yesterday the proposed merger reached him on November 21st, 2016, after the CCPC ruling and that his officials recommended on January 4th, 2017, that it be referred to the BAI. The referral was official approved by him on January 10th, 2017, and then announced.The BAI was given 80 days to examine if the takeover would damage media plurality in Ireland given it would have increased INM’s ownership of regional newspapers from 13 to 20.Asked if he had any other contact with INM staff, Mr Naughten told the Dáil that, in May 2017, he met Mr Buckley at an INM data conference at the RDS in Dublin. They engaged in small talk, he said. The following month, INM and Celtic called off their proposed merger, just before Mr Naughten was due to consider the BAI’s report.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Leaders mark decades of progress but failure to deliver peace among country\u0026rsquos many problemsAdvance UN security detail forced to withdraw from Douma after being fired uponNumber of executions on judicial assembly line raises fears of miscarriages of justiceInternational investigators are allowed access to the town following alleged gas attackBritish PM defends decision to launch action against Assad without parliamentary approvalPrime minister insists call made in \u0026lsquonational interest\u0026rsquo rather than due to pressure from USLuxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regimeImpact of the strikes could have been limited by the amount of time Syria had to prepareTheresa May to seek Commons debate amid calls she lacked authority for attackUK, US and France target alleged chemical weapons facilities in bombing campaignMilitary action against Syria brings warnings from Iran and most Arab governmentsUS ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weaponsVincent Durac: It\u0026rsquos expected this US-led attack will be of much longer duration than last year\u0026rsquos\u0026lsquoWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents\u0026rsquoGrim total of 511,000 casualties may be disputed but each death is vital to accountabilityUN inspectors arrive in Syria to investigate last week\u0026rsquos chemical weapons assaultOne killed and more than 100 injured from live Israeli fireBritain asks Cyprus to reserve airspace in preparation for possible air strikes on SyriaMore than 40 people were killed in the strike in Douma last week, WHO saysThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.The research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.The research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Instead, it will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked so that they can keep using Facebook, and tell them to limit that collection using its settings if they don\u0027t.But the site has warned that it will never be possible to turn off all ad tracking, as it isn\u0027t on many websites. People will always have the option to leave entirely, a senior member of staff said.New privacy laws come into effect from the European Union this May, which apply to all companies who collect data on people within Europe.

A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.Facebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.The company said that it will now give people the chance to opt into targeted marketing, and having their data collected for ads. If they don\u0027t want to do that, they will be able to turn some of the settings off, but the site has made very clear that will not apply to all of them.The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.Facebook admits it tracks users around the internet for adsFacebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans’ permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.“Facebook is an advertising-supported service,” Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook’s headquarters.Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but “all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that’s true for offline advertising, as well”.Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, will use what are known as “permission screens” – pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance – to notify and obtain approval.The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit “decline.” Instead, they will guide users to either “accept and continue” or “manage data setting,” according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.“People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,” Sherman said.Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to US congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook’s commitment to privacy.Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.Additional reporting by agenciesThe Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Improvements in popularity were from a very low base, and only a minority of switchers preferred a Corbyn premiership.”British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street for the 1922 committee on June 12, 2017 in London, England.

More than a quarter (26 per cent) did not vote Labour in 2015, but switched their support shortly before polling day in 2017.A further 13 per cent did vote for the party in 2015, then said at the start of the 2017 campaign they would not do so again – but ultimately changed their minds during the six-week period.The average age of these late switchers was 45, compared to an average of 36 among people who had already decided by the start of the campaign to switch their support to Mr Corbyn’s party.Policy Network said that, to be in with a chance of winning a majority at the next election, Labour needs to hold on to the late switchers while also winning back the support of those who voted for the party in 2015, but not in 2017.This group also tends to be older, more opposed to immigration and less favourable to Mr Corbyn’s leadership than existing Labour voters.  Policy Network researcher Charlie Cadywould, who carried out the study, said: “Despite remarkable consistency in the polls since last June, politics remains as volatile as ever. That election showed conclusively that campaigns matter, with Labour’s fortunes turning in dramatic fashion.“Whenever the next one is called, whatever the polling at the time, neither party should go into it counting any chickens.“Our analysis shows that such a turnaround can come from any part of the electorate. Contrary to many assumptions, it wasn’t the young, passionate pro-Europeans or Corbyn-enthusiasts that drove Labour’s campaign comeback.”“To win next time around, the party will need to focus on winning back those it has lost since 2015, as well as those that have not recently – or ever – voted Labour.”He added: “Whatever happens to Labour or the Conservatives over the next four years could be wiped out overnight. We saw in 2017 what an impact a botched manifesto launch, a gaffe or an unforeseen event can have on a campaign.“The 2017 experience should warn all party leaders of the danger of hubris.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Guy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

The rotting food also emits methane as it disintegrates in landfills, adding the the atmosphere’s stock of greenhouse gases.The study was composed after researchers looked at eight years of food data to try and determine what sorts of food is wasted, and what sorts of behaviours Americans have during various meal times.The most wasteful of Americans tend to be those who are the healthiest, the researchers found, because those iniduals tend to keep a diet high in perishable fruits and vegetables.“We need a simultaneous effort to increase food quality as well as reduce food waste,” Lisa Jahns, a nutritionist at the USDA, told the Guardian. “We need to put both of those things out.”One false move and it\u0027s £1500 down the drainor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This year\u0027s transition is seen as a test of whether the Cuban Communist Party can continue its one-party rule in the absence of its more well-known leaders.Mr Diaz-Canel has served as vice president of the powerful Council of State since 2013, when he was appointed by party leadership and approved by the National Assembly. The general public knows little about the 57-year-old former engineer, who has granted no interviews to foreign news outlets.A man rides his modified bicycle past a vintage American car in HavanaA taxi sits parked by Ancon Beach waiting for returning bathers in TrinidadAfrocuban carnival group Los componedores de batea performing in the streets of La Habana ViejaPastel colours for an ice-cream place and a vintage American car in Cienfuegos after sunsetA man on the phone in a bookshop in Old Havana (Habana Vieja) selling books and displaying propaganda poster of the Cuban RevolutionStreet Musicians in Santiago De CubaA man works to repair his classic American car after it broke down along the Prado, a wide avenue that runs from Parque Central to the Malecon seafront highway, in HavanaMembers of the \u0027Ladies in White,\u0027 a group founded by the partners and relatives of jailed dissidents that regularly protests against the Cuban government, demonstrate on the streets of HavanaStreet vegetables vendor in HavanaThe sun setting through the palm trees and creates long shadows on the pool deck at this resort in Cuba VaraderoGeneral view of a street in HavanaA girls plays on a street in HavanaGirls walk past graffiti art along the Paseo de Marti, the wide boulevard that runs through the heart of the historic Old Havana neighborhood in HavanaA woman smokes her Havana cigarA man harvests tobacco leaves for drying at a tobacco drying house on a co-op plantation in Pinar del RioMen play chess on a street in HavanaLocals take part in a gay parade in HavanaScene of the Memories Paraiso Azul resort in Santa Maria KeyBeach on the Bay of Pigs, Zapata PeninsulaDivers swimming above coral reef in Caribbean SeaBut Mr Diaz-Canel is well-known to Communist Party leaders, having worked his way up the ranks for more than 30 years. He started as a member of the Young Communists\u0027 Union in 1987, and became the first party secretary in Villa Clara province by 1994. He has also served as Cuba\u0027s minister of education, and lead delegations to Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, and several South American countries.Mr Diaz-Canel was born after the Cuban Revolution – one year after Fidel Castro took office – but has shown no signs of abandoning his revolutionary predecessors\u0027 policies.I believe in continuity, he told reporters who asked about his vision for Cuba\u0027s future, according to CNN. I think there always will be continuity.Mr Diaz-Canel is expected take office after Mr Castro retires this week, after serving two successive five-year terms. Mr Castro took over from his brother, Fidel, when he resigned in 2008. The two brothers have ruled the country since the revolution in 1959.Rual Castro is remembered for opening up the Communist country up to slightly more private enterprise, and for restoring diplomatic relations with the US under President Barack Obama. He will continue to serve as president of the Communist Party – a powerful government role. He attended and applauded Mr Diaz-Canel\u0027s nomination on Wednesday.Cuban elections are a multi-pronged process that start with the election of municipal representatives and end with the selection of the president. Candidates for many roles – including the president and vice president – are selected by government bodies.

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.
