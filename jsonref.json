One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp - Mirror OnlineElon Musk denies threesome with Amber Heard and Cara Delevingne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ed507203aabe0b98e339d917da33deed420fe/43_81_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb19a41fc94e32a182f340d362d7234","title":"prince parade cherry moon jeff katz best photograph","story":"‘I took this on the Cote d’Azur where he was filming Under the Cherry Moon surrounded by megastars. He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b7a3a686f3fee2b41a3a7eacac4b74be49e39a/0_159_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1117e21718935dd1d8cd9461c2710586","title":"grace jones jagger gaga and more music legends in pictures","story":"From Bowie outtakes to early shots of Rihanna and Amy Winehouse, these rare prints are being sold to support the entertainment industry during Covid-19 and fight racial injustice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcec264292db299cbbfca29abf134c1223104ffc/0_0_2953_1905/master/2953.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8df8e16972636d83a919498a58320348 2020w","title":"delivering joy meet south londons lockdown book angel","story":"As libraries remain shut, Millie Ginnett has been delivering secondhand books to desperate readers. She talks about trading books for brownies, and which novels have been most popularIn the three months since lockdown began, I’ve spent more on books than I care to admit. But with charity shops and secondhand bookshops shut, donating finished books seemed impossible – until I discovered the South London Book Swap. It is run by Millie Ginnett since she was furloughed from her advertising job in April, and she is bringing joy to the lives of those stuck at home.“Everyone was asking how I was going to make my time on furlough ‘productive’. They were asking, what online courses I was planning to take, was I going to learn a language, none of which I wanted to do,” says Ginnett. “I was burning through books and after swapping a few with a friend, I resorted to buying some – which I knew would get expensive and was unsustainable.”Ginnett, who lives in Tooting with her boyfriend, posted a list of around 20 books on various community support groups, and offered to deliver them as part of her daily exercise. All of them were snapped up that day. So Ginnett set up the South London Book Swap on Facebook. Within two days, she had amassed almost 300 books by collecting them from doorsteps all around south London.“The group has gone from strength to strength, gaining more members every week I feel so privileged to have met and interacted with many amazing people who I maybe never would have had the chance to otherwise,” she says. “One lady gave me some fresh blondies in exchange for her book, and we laughed about how wholesome it was to swap baked goods for books.”Another person gave her wine vouchers, which Ginnett used to celebrate when she hit the 500-book milestone. And there was also a high-speed book drop: “It was a rainy evening and I was meeting a lady on her bus route home. She ran to the front of the bus and grabbed them from me without getting off. The driver was very amused!”Ginnett collects the books from people’s doorsteps, adds them to a spreadsheet, and then photographs them by genre. Books are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. She wipes down all the books before rehoming them, either by delivering them on her walks, or collection from a box outside her house made by her boyfriend.As libraries remain shut, demand is high, with books such as Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams and The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris proving most popular. One week, I managed to bag a copy of Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo. Navigating several school drop-offs meant collection was tricky, so it was a delight to have Ginnett leave it on my doorstep, and to have a socially distanced chat.There are currently 378 people signed up to receive and donate books. The swap has even spawned a sister group in Fiji.Ginnett hopes to continue the group after lockdown ends, but says she may have to find an alternative way to keep it running. “I’m keen to carry the swap on for as long as I can, but once I’m back at work I will struggle to keep up, with the collections, deliveries and admin. We will also have to turn our library back into a spare bedroom as and when we are allowed to have people stay again, which means I would have nowhere to store the books in our small flat.” But with such strong community support, Ginnett is brainstorming all options, including starting a weekend stall or handing the project on to a member.“I’ve had so many touching messages from people who have found it a help during this uncertain and scary time,” she says. “I will keep thinking and working towards ways of keeping it alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3418873fce60d267bad82e6a375e44601ff1dfb/0_178_5385_3234/master/5385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6077048ffa4c32affb22312e12d9de","title":"uk retailers remain gloomy about quick post lockdown bounce back","story":"CBI says retailers fear lower consumer demand, problems from staff absences and transport difficulties will hit dent salesBritain’s retailers are downbeat about the prospects of a rapid bounce back in business after the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, the CBI has reported.Despite the reopening of non-essential stores from 15 June, retailers fear that a lack of demand and a continued absence of staff due to school closures will leave sales in July well below levels of a year ago.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: “With high street shops, department stores and shopping centres reopening across England last week amid some scenes of long queues, you’d be forgiven for thinking retailers’ difficulties are coming to an end. But the health of the retail sector remains in the balance.“Despite retailers working flat out to make sure they are safe and ready to open their doors, outside the grocery sector most retailers expect sales to be far below where they were this time last year.“Enabling these businesses to open is a critical step on the road to restarting our economy and will help support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691ab490cfae444fde14b10d2ee844d7ea038fc5/0_0_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4842a3f0a8d0c8d0c67af5a638d7765c","title":"markets ftse covid 19 cases investors retail sales unemployment business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsThere’s still two hours to go, but Wall Street isn’t expected to bounce back when trading starts.A reminder of the scale of the Wirecard scandal:Cinema-goers will be barred from visiting the pick-n-mix stall when they’re allowed back to the screens next month.The new coronavirus safety measures outlaw cinemas from selling open, unpacked, confectionery, to curb the spread of Covid-19. Disappointment for sweet-toothed film fans, but perhaps a relief for parents who fear they’ll need a second mortgage to fund a handful of fizzy cola bottles.Singalongs are also outlawed because of worries they could encourage aerosol spreading of the virus. So, no chance to warble along to Mamma Mia!, The Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Sound of Music (shame....).Although the FTSE 100 has recovered its earlier losses, there are twice as many fallers as risers on the blue-chip index today.Technology stocks, consumer cyclicals and industrial groups are down, suggesting there is still concern about the impact of rising Covid-19 cases on the economy.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:“Any gains made by equities over the last week or so are being wiped out as concern builds over the increase in coronavirus infections in the US.“Selling which started in Europe on Wednesday spread to the US overnight, not helped by sickly looking US manufacturing numbers.”Apple’s decision to reintroduce store closures in some US cities seems emblematic of the ongoing struggle with the disease in the world’s largest economy.Just in: UK retailers remain very gloomy about their prospects this summer, despite the government’s efforts to reopen the economy.The “vast majority” of retailers expect sales to be lower in July than a year ago, after suffering slumping sales under the lockdown, according to the latest survey from the CBI.Retailers also reported that sales were much poorer in June than a year ago, although not as bad as in May.Here are the key findings from the report:Shares in Wirecard have, predictably, plunged after it applied for insolvency protection (which will presumably wipe investors out).They’re changing hands at just €2.50 each this morning, down from €140 back in January. Many investors will now be wondering why they ignored the warning signs - the Financial Times’ excellent investigation flagged up there was something seriously wrong with Wirecard’s accounts. German financial regulator Bafin is also in hot water, after it banned investors from betting against Wirecard shares and filed criminal charges against the FT! Wirecard may simply have been too important. Europe has long been envious of Silicon Valley’s success, so didn’t want to admit that one of its own rising stars was flawed. Here’s our news story on Wirecard’s fall from grace:The crisis in the airlines industry also deepened overnight, with Australia’s Qantas announcing 6,000 job cuts.The 2,000 job cuts announced at Royal Mail today will hit managers, not posties on the streets.But frontline jobs are also under threat, as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains:CEO Keith Williams described the job cuts as “regrettable”, adding: “We are committed to conducting the upcoming consultation process carefully and sensitively. We will work closely with our managers and their representatives during this difficult period, including supporting them as they transition into the next stage in their careers.”While delivery staff were not targeted by the cuts, Royal Mail confirmed there would be a gradual decline in frontline workers as it started to automate the processing of letters and parcels.Newsflash: German payments company Wirecard has applied to open insolvency proceedings, a week after admitting that €1.9bn is missing from its accounts.The management board of Wirecard AG has decided today to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings for Wirecard AG with the competent district court of Munich (Amtsgericht München) due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness.It is currently evaluated whether insolvency applications have to be filed for subsidiaries of Wirecard Group.Wirecard’s technology handles billions of payments between online retailers and customers each year. CEO Markus Braun was arrested on Monday. Last Thursday, Wirecard admitted the money was missing - having previously denied reports in the Financial Times that its sales and profits were being artificially inflated, misleading auditors for many years.Britain’s stock market has now shrugged off its early losses, driving the FTSE 100 back up towards last night’s close.Investors seem to be cheered by the ECB’s new offer of euro loans to non-eurozone central banks (see previous post)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137617c874d6900dc884d79ddff39a16d28e3616/4_0_1663_998/master/1663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4be1240ed16274f6d35ce7ef62ba8529","title":"it got to 38 degrees in the arctic civilisation is burning down","story":"New research proves what we already knew, the main problem with climate change is ... the super wealthy!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0795d134e6156233d2e20c14c1805db78ebba3de/0_212_3216_1929/master/3216.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=84f87b37c19247cd629f4b9024c769b0","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

Launched into the water last month, this is no shipwreck, but the base of what will soon become a floating home and, in the eyes of its makers, the first step towards building a brave new post-Covid-19 society, out on the open ocean.“Coronavirus is an opportunity to show the world that what we’re building is actually going to be very useful in the future,” says Chad Elwartowski, in a recent video post from his beachside base in Panama. The Michigan-born software engineer turned bitcoin trader is a leading figure in the seasteading movement, a libertarian group dedicated to building independent floating cities on the high seas. Along with the bunker builders and survivalist preppers, their long-held ambitions have been bolstered by the current global pandemic. “No matter if you’re scared of the virus or the reaction to the virus,” he adds, “living out on the ocean will be helpful for these situations.”It is not the first time Elwartowski has attempted to realise his dream of a floating future. In April last year, he and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet (aka Nadia Summergirl), were forced to flee their first floating home off the coast of Thailand, just moments before it was raided by the Thai navy. They had constructed what they declared to be “the first seastead” 12 nautical miles from Phuket, but the authorities decided that the six metre-wide fibreglass cabin, perched on top of a floating pole, posed a threat to Thailand’s sovereignty. It was an offence punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty. “The couple announced on social media declaring their autonomy beyond the jurisdiction of any courts or law of any countries, including Thailand,” said Rear Admiral Vithanarat Kochaseni, adding that they had invited others to join them. “We see such action as deteriorating Thailand’s independence.”After a few weeks on the run, dodging Thai patrol boats and eventually making their way to Singapore, the couple moved to Panama to relaunch their company, Ocean Builders with the financial backer of the project, Rüdiger Koch, a retired German aerospace engineer. “This event has doubled down our efforts,” the group said in a statement, following the Thai ordeal. “We can all clearly see that seasteading needs to happen now as tyranny creeps ever more deeply into our governments to the point that they are willing to hunt down a couple of residents residing in a floating house in middle of nowhere.”The coronavirus pandemic has given fringe libertarian groups around the world renewed vigour to pursue their dreams of building autonomous new societies. Government-enforced lockdowns and increased digital surveillance have added fuel to their suspicions of state control, while the suspension of day-to-day norms and the spectre of an economic meltdown have amplified their calls to rethink society. “When you’re not sure which virus is more contagious,” says the slogan of a recent meme made by Americans for Liberty, shared on Elwartowski’s Facebook page. “Covid-19, or those fine with complete government control.”The sentiment lies at the core of the seasteading community, a disparate group that has grown since 2008, when the Seasteading Institute was founded in San Francisco by Patri Friedman. The self-styled anarcho-capitalist (and grandson of Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman) was working as a Google software engineer when he managed to attract funding from PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel to set up the institute. In a founding statement, they described its goal as being “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with erse social, political, and legal systems”. Thiel was nothing if not confident: “The nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level,” he proclaimed.Seasteading represents the ultimate Silicon Valley approach to governance, conceiving society as a technology that can be hacked and innovated upon as simply as an operating system. It is predicated on the idea that government regulation stifles innovation, and therefore the route to a better world can only be found by unleashing a new generation of start-up societies that are forced to compete for citizens in a free market of ideologies. Don’t like the rules of your current micro-nation? Simply move to another one. “We will give people the freedom to choose the government they want,” said Friedman, “instead of being stuck with the government they get.” Its boosters see it as the route to salvation its critics say it would lead to “an apartheid of the worst kind”.Progress has been bumpy. Thiel’s donations soon dried up, and Friedman’s plans never got much further than launching Ephemerisle – a waterborne version of the Burning Man festival, staged in the Sacramento River delta near San Francisco, where rival floating pontoons compete for the attention of soggy partygoers. He has since moved his focus away from the water, recently launching a company to develop experimental cities on dry land instead. But the Seasteading Institute continues without him, headed by author and self-appointed “seavangelist”, Joe Quirk.“Nearly half of the world’s surface is unclaimed,” says Quirk, who published a book on seasteading in 2017, with the ambitious subtitle: “How floating nations will restore the environment, enrich the poor, cure the sick, and liberate humanity from politicians”. In an introductory video, he describes the planet’s oceans as “a sort of research and development zone where we could discover better means of governance”, and says that seasteading could “provide the technology for thousands of people to start their own nano-nation on the high seas”, giving people “opportunities to peacefully test new ideas about living together”. The most successful seasteads, he says, “will become thriving new societies, inspiring change around the world”.So far, his own attempts don’t bode particularly well for the future of floating utopias. In January 2017, after years of technical feasibility studies and political negotiations, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of French Polynesia to build the first seasteads in its territorial waters. The designs, developed by Dutch architects Blue21, looked like a high-end resort in the Males, depicting a series of villas linked by an undulating green landscape. It was all to be magicked from the waters by an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding through selling tokens of a new cryptocurrency, all the rage among the tech community in 2017. “We’re going to draw a new map of the world with French Polynesia at the centre of the aquatic age,” Quirk declared.The choice of location was strategic. Comprised of almost 120 dispersed low-lying islands and atolls, French Polynesia is at severe risk of suffering devastating consequences from even the slightest rise in sea level. It also happens to boast the world’s largest exclusive economic zone, an area of sea that can stretch for 200 nautical miles from a territory’s coastline, over which it can claim exclusive economic rights. At five million square kilometres, French Polynesian waters  an area as large as the landmass of the entire European Union, making it an ideal place to experiment with novel forms of aquatic jurisdiction. In theory.“We explained to the Polynesians how having a quasi-autonomous area nearby was a good thing,” says Tom W Bell, professor of law at Chapman University in Orange County, California, who drew up the legal agreement for the project. “Look at Monaco, or Hong Kong or Singapore – special jurisdictions create a lot of growth outside their borders.” In his book, Your Next Government? From the Nation State to Stateless Nations, Bell traces the projected evolution of a seastead. It would begin “like a coral polyp”, he writes, protected by a country’s territorial waters, where it would start to generate economic activity, “enriching its environment and attracting still more life”, before breaking free to start a new autonomous life on the open ocean. Ultimately, he imagines seasteads nurtured by different host nations congregating in mid-ocean gyres, sheltered within floating breakwaters. “A new kind of government arises,” he writes, “born in Earth’s last free places, fated to advance the human frontier.”The reality didn’t quite pan out that way in the South Pacific. “There wasn’t a perfect alignment of interests,” says Marc Collins Chen, former minister of tourism of French Polynesia, who co-founded the company Blue Frontiers with Quirk to realise the project. “The government was looking for something to address sea level rise and environmental degradation, whereas the Seasteading Institute was more about autonomy.” He says that the prospect of a tax-free enclave held little appeal for the locals, given that Polynesians don’t pay income tax anyway. One Tahitian TV host compared the situation to the evil Galactic Empire in Star Wars imposing on the innocent Ewoks, while secretly building the Death Star. The libertarian position didn’t help either. As Collins Chen puts it: “It’s very difficult to ask for government support when your narrative is that you want to get rid of politicians.” In retrospect, Bell agrees: “They already had a beautiful paradise in French Polynesia. The local community wasn’t very enthusiastic about the project, and I get it. They didn’t need strangers coming in and ruining their view.”Collins Chen has since moved to New York, where he has established a new company to develop further plans for floating cities, this time stripped of any libertarian tax-dodging ideology. “I realised that the real future for these sorts of projects has to be closer to cities,” he says. “They have to be an extension of an existing city’s infrastructure, they need to be run by the mayor, and they have to pay their taxes – as opposed to being enclaves for the wealthy.”His plan, titled Oceanix City, has been designed in slick Ted Talk style by Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect beloved of Silicon Valley tech companies. His twinkling animations depict a floating world of interlocking hexagonal islands, where power is harvested from waves and the sun, where residents live on a diet of seaweed and fish, and where marine life is “regenerated” by artificial reefs. “If this floating city flourishes,” said Ingels in a presentation, “it can then grow like a culture in a petri dish.” On a screen behind him, the floating hexagons multiplied until they took up an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, a vision of low-density suburbia sprawling virulently across the sea.“Over the next 40 years, the world is expected to build 230bn square metres in new construction,” says Collins Chen, “the equivalent of adding one New York City every month. This could be a way to accommodate that growth, without the devastating effects of land reclamation or deforestation.” He says part of the appeal is the ability to reconfigure the urban form according to changing needs, in a process of drag-and-drop city building. “You could literally float one a city block away and put a different one in its place, when the need for a new school, hospital or university arose.”Remarkably, their sci-fi scheme has won the support of the United Nations’ sustainable development arm, UN-Habitat, which hosted a round table discussion for the project in April 2019. As global heating accelerates, sea levels rise and more people crowd into urban slums, “floating cities is one of the possible solutions,” said UN-Habitat’s executive director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Back in Panama, the notion that floating habitats could be an inclusive solution to global housing need seems a long way off, to put it mildly. Despite the country’s coronavirus lockdown, the Ocean Builders team has been at work throughout, laying the foundations for a factory that will soon house the largest 3D printer in Central America, ready to produce what their website touts as “the world’s first 3D-printed, smart floating home with an underwater room wrapped in an eco restorative 3D-printed coral reef” – yours for between $200,000 to $800,000 (£160,000 to £640,000).“In light of the global pandemic, we’re really focusing on making the homes feel like a kind of lifeboat,” says the company’s CEO, Grant Romundt, who worked on the Freedom Ship project in Florida in the 1990s, an aborted plan to build a mile-long cruise ship for 40,000 people, topped with a runway. “They should be a safe place to escape to and be totally energy independent, with solar panels on the roof, water desalination on board, waste collection by drone, and aeroponic systems to grow your own food.”Designed by Koen Olthuis of Dutch architecture practice Waterstudio, the plans for the luxury “SeaPods” look like a row of gigantic motorbike helmets on poles, sticking up out of the sea in pearlescent shades of blue, green and grey. “We wanted to have something that was very futuristic looking, very clean and flowing,” says Romundt. “I didn’t want to have a 90-degree corner anywhere in the house. I think that’s bad feng shui.” The interiors recall supersized sanitaryware, envisaged as white, wipe-clean worlds of free-flowing surfaces, echoing retro-futuristic visions of streamlined space capsules. The similarity is no accident: for company founder, Rüdiger Koch, seasteading is merely a stepping stone for trialling exploits in space. He has long harboured plans to build a cable “launch loop” to propel payloads into space without rockets, and he sees the ocean as the perfect launchpad. “There are almost only large open spaces at sea,” he told German regional newspaper, Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, “and you need them to make sure that nothing goes wrong and nobody is hit by possible flying parts.”Romundt insists that the company is merely building floating holiday homes, which will be registered as boats under the Panama flag for legal purposes, and likely operate on a timeshare basis. “That would give you the slow adjustment period,” he says, “then more of an economy would start to build as more people come requiring more services, and it would start to self-perpetuate and grow.”For Bell, the ultimate goal is to see such floating communities raise their own flags in the open ocean. “Right now, a self-flagged seastead would have effectively no status at all in international law,” he says. “The coast guard would show up, assume you were either a pirate or a floating meth lab, and tow you right back in to shore. But if seasteaders can say they have enough people and a big enough territory, and start flagging themselves, that’s when things will start to get interesting.”And if they fail? “That’s the marvellous thing about seasteads,” says Quirk. “If a government fails, there’s nothing much the people who live there can do about it, but if seasteads fail, they simply disassemble and go away” – seeing all those bitcoin dollars sink into the sea just as quickly as they were conjured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc366b8c53b65cd1183e3695c6bf80616b22064/0_1070_3230_1936/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb328511bd1699320214b575f561700a","title":"act fast to stop uk carbon emission rebound climate advisers urge","story":"Report says Boris Johnson’s lack of climate leadership risks missing target and embarrassing UK at Cop26The UK is falling behind on its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and risks a surge in carbon emissions as lockdown eases, the government’s climate advisers warn.Ministers must act fast if the UK is to avoid a massive rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis eases, Lord Deben, chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), which published its progress report to parliament on Thursday, said. By setting up new schemes to insulate homes, raise carbon taxes, switch to electric vehicles and improve broadband, the government could spur a green recovery to create jobs and cut emissions permanently.The CCC found that the lack of clear leadership and direction from the prime minister was at the heart of the problem, just as the world was looking to the UK as host of the next UN climate summit.Boris Johnson has chaired only one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change since taking personal charge of the issue last October, with the government’s statutory advisers urging him to convene the group more often, as a matter of urgency, if the UK is to meet its 2050 net zero carbon target, which is off track.Deben added: “We have to do this as rapidly as possible – this window of opportunity is closing clearly. What we do not want is a lot of good-hearted statements about beginning policies – what we need to do is seize the opportunity.”Delay in the government’s regulations for housebuilding had already resulted in 1 million new homes that were “not fit for purpose” because they had been built to old inefficient standards, he said. They would all have to be retrofitted for energy efficiency at extra cost.“That’s what happens if you don’t take these measures,” he said.The “central role” of the cabinet committee on climate change, which Johnson said last October would spearhead a cross-government push to bring down emissions, is mentioned 10 times in the CCC’s 196-page progress report to parliament, published on Thursday.The cabinet committee’s one meeting, chaired by Johnson, was in March, the  has established, and a second meeting is planned in the near future. Details are scant as the government has said it does not intend to report publicly on the committee meetings.Insiders told the  that despite the government’s public commitment to net zero carbon emissions, the lack of leadership was severely hampering the UK’s ability to meet its carbon targets and its credibility as host of next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit.“We are not being given a good lead by the prime minister and this is really undermining our ability to move things on,” said Tom Burke, co-founder of the environment thinktank E3G and a veteran government adviser. “What binds any institution, but especially the government, is leadership, and if you don’t get leadership, then people go off in different directions.”He called for Johnson to take personal control. “The point of setting up a cabinet committee is to signal the importance of the issue for the government. If you don’t follow up that signal by using the device you created, you tell people you are more interested in the headline than in the outcome.”Other recommendations in the CCC report include:The report sets out 29 milestones for the government to reach by 2030, as well as more than 130 detailed policy recommendations covering each government department. Ministers must respond to the report by 15 October.A government spokesperson said: “We agree with the CCC that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. We were the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and want to ensure the UK has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.”Green campaigners called on ministers to act urgently, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepared a statement on the post-coronavirus economic rescue package for early next month. Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK, said: “The likes of energy, efficiency, cycling and saving peatlands are essential, not nice-to-have measures. The CCC have shown the government where they need to put their money, and all eyes are now on the chancellor to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ed6ca88087f5875d2f2052bc519c1211d27979/0_261_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20393a1f7f50e4db9ebeed80553b342d","title":"road to net zero what the committee on climate change recommends","story":"The government adviser publishes its progress report today. Here are the areas it says require urgent attentionThe government’s statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), publishes its progress report on Thursday on efforts to cut emissions. This is what it says needs to happen urgently if the UK is to reach its target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050.A national plan for insulating the UK’s draughty homes is needed. This would create thousands of new green jobs as the UK struggles to emerge from the coronavirus recession. Previous attempts at national programmes have foundered and there are few incentives for homeowners to pursue energy efficiency, but housing is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, along with transport.Gas boilers are one of the most intractable problems for reducing emissions. Alternatives such as ground-source heat pumps have been slow to take off, but low-carbon heating must become the dominant form of new heating installation by the early 2030s.Earlier this year, the prime minister pledged to bring forward the phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles to 2035. The CCC says its research suggests the switch could be managed by 2032, despite objections by car manufacturers.Oil prices stand at historic lows, making this a good time to raise fuel duty without hitting consumers, according to the CCC. About £15bn a year could be raised in government revenues that could be recycled into other green measures, such as incentives to motorists to switch to electric vehicles.Tree planting and restoring peatlands, wetlands and other natural carbon sinks could generate “shovel-ready” projects that create new jobs around the country – in rural areas, but also in cities where green space is shrinking. The agriculture bill going through parliament should offer an opportunity for more nature-friendly farming that helps lock carbon into vegetation and soils, turning agriculture from a major source of emissions to a net absorber.The net zero economy will require a net zero workforce, according to the report. This will include everything from installing low-carbon boilers and home insulation to improving broadband networks (for more home-working) and creating jobs in burgeoning industries such as offshore wind. The recovery from the Covid-19 crisis offers an opportunity for the government to step in with retraining incentives.About half of employed people in the UK were working from home during April, the CCC found, showing how much home working is possible. If more of us worked at home, transport emissions would be vastly reduced, so more employers should be encouraged to make the changes permanent where possible. New infrastructure is needed to help people continue to cycle and walk to work. The public sector should lead by example in encouraging remote working.Kickstarting research and innovation in low-carbon technologies will be vital if the UK is to become a centre of low-carbon development after leaving the EU. Promising technologies include hydrogen fuel and the development of carbon capture and storage in depleted oilfields under the North Sea.Ministers have pledged to spend £5bn on flood defences, which could be brought forward to protect homes and create green jobs. Housebuilders and homeowners also need to adapt the UK’s housing to hotter summers older people in particular are in danger from more frequent heatwaves. Growing thick ivy on the walls is one good way to protect a house against overheating in scorching summers, the CCC says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea9476a6c2b341f0cf592889835df020afd15b67/0_0_5617_3371/master/5617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec39e5b3a35e92dc348cdf19859920d","title":"what the west midlands is getting right and wrong for cycling","story":"The region has made progress in getting people on to bikes, but where’s the ambition?When the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, stood on an unlit section of towpath opposite what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse recently and hailed a “big summer for cycling and walking”, it was perhaps worryingly symbolic. That Friday, hours after Street invited us to “come cycle Birmingham’s canals”, at least two women were pushed into Birmingham waterways by a group of young men.The West Midlands is proud of its industrial heritage, but unlit, isolated towpaths are no replacement for a cycle network that safely takes people places they want to be.Happily, another part of the region’s heritage is the modern bicycle, invented on Street’s patch by JK Starley in Coventry in 1884, kickstarting an era of bike manufacturing in the region.Street, the former boss of John Lewis, was elected the region’s Conservative mayor in May 2017. Improvement of the region’s canal network aside, just four miles of protected on-road cycle routes have been built by Birmingham since, and those were funded via the city council rather than Street’s combined authority. Birmingham may have bold plans to cut unnecessary car use, but there are concerns too little is being done to help people cycle in the region.The West Midlands was given £17.2m from the government’s emergency active travel fund in May, £3.4m to be spent in the next two months on 47 projects including a pop-up cycle route from Coventry city centre to the canal basin, bike parking and cycle training. How the remaining £13.6m will be spent is still under discussion with the region’s seven council leaders.Street’s team will top that up with a £23m pot granted by government last year. Of that sum, £15m was already assigned to four main projects, three alongside rapid bus or metro extensions for delivery in 2022 or 2023 and a route between Coventry University and University hospital, now being brought forward to start this year. Community projects were allocated £2m.In the long term, West Midlands’ 200km region-wide “route network plan” lacks the scope, the cohesive branding or urgency of Street’s colleagues’ plans in Manchester – the 1,800-mile £1.5bn Bee network Sheffield – 620 miles of walking and cycling routes and Leicester, which is currently adding a mile a week to its active travel network.Then there’s confusion over the contract of Street’s cycling and walking ambassador, the former world champion cyclist Shanaze Reade, which her agent says Transport for West Midlands decided not to renew last month. Street, however, insists “her contract’s been extended, so as far as I’m concerned, we have a cycling champion”. Street’s press department said they are looking to work with Reade “ad hoc” in what sounds like a zero-hours version of roles held by counterparts Chris Boardman in Manchester and Sarah Storey in Sheffield.As mayor it’s Street’s job to cheerlead for investment in the region and to allocate government funding for the seven councils to spend, but he seems to be talking cycling down while saying “the best way of getting people out of their cars is to invest in rail and that is what we want to do“. He is also still banging a drum for the car industry, a major employer in the region.More worryingly, a document published this week detailing the region’s post-coronavirus recovery plans and setting out requests for funding from central government makes only a single passing mention of cycling. This may be a missed opportunity, given the government has explicitly told local councils they must support walking and cycling in any plans.It’s fair to say the region hasn’t had the cycling investment London has enjoyed, and high-quality routes are not always cheap – though they still cost a fraction of the amounts pledged to road building. Street says Birmingham’s two protected routes cost £60m, although Birmingham city council’s website says they cost £12.4m, including a city-centre link. Either way, with the £23m pot alone, they have £10 per head to spend on cycling in the next year, a lot more than most UK cities.Street’s own government has said it wants to “decarbonise transport” and reduce car use, and Boris Johnson has called for a “golden age of cycling”.Street says with the money available, current cycling plans are realistic. But are they really ambitious? His response: “The evidence of that is, once we’ve got just this little bit of emergency funding, how imaginatively, quickly, in a united way – no political difficulties over this – all of our boroughs have got behind the opportunity.“There is no lack of desire or ambition. It’s a question of how rapidly we can assemble the funding, as it was not here historically. I actually think we’ve done a pretty decent job.”It’s good to hear this, and there is progress. The region’s bike hire scheme, NextBike, foundered last year after supplier issues led to the contract being terminated, which Street says was a frustration. A new supplier will be chosen in July and “we will be rolling that out through this year”, he said.Street’s position, like other city mayors, is in limbo, with elections postponed during the coronavirus crisis. This leaves him a choice: He can talk up cycling as a viable means of mass transport, or he can keep it a minority pursuit to be delivered while keeping cycles on towpaths out of the way of cars.If he wants the former, that means having a big vision for it, as he does with his £15bn public transport network. He could learn from counterparts in Manchester, Leicester, Sheffield and indeed London – think, talk and plan big for cycling, ready for the next round of funding when it comes, which it will. He could realise the huge potential for cycling in the region by planning a genuine network of safe, protected cycle routes on roads – the network that already takes people where they want to go.The potential is huge, but now is the time for deeds to match words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0a53a5eabd44b4f662b2966839007efed38fd5/0_0_4561_2739/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f51266c1dcb4c0139caf4613327672","title":"glastonbury is 50 the best style moments in pictures","story":"From Kate Moss’s mini-minidress in 2004 to Lizzo in lilac sequins and Dennis Brown’s 80s double denim, here are 35 great looks seen at Worthy Farm over the years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb44a52c89753b637f75213df5e9846c27b78ac4/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fbac266770492d0447729fd92e1e2e4","title":"the booksellers review","story":"New York’s bibliophiles provide the contents of a documentary about a once-cherished trade caught in a bind by the digital ageThe interest of this garrulous, convivial documentary creeps up on you by degrees: a study of secondhand and antiquarian booksellers in New York City. This was once a clubbable – and very male – profession that hardly changed for centuries, run by a mole-tribe of eccentric, tweed-wearing guys who were irritated to be beckoned from their chaotic shelves of old books by someone cheeky enough to want to buy one. (I myself find something necrophiliac and stifling about used-book shops like this, but this film sold me on them, a bit.)The business was upended by the internet, which brought unexpected calamities and benefits. The market for mid-range 20th-century first editions – ie a mint-condition copy of Ian Fleming’s From Russia With Love – collapsed because their rarity value plummeted: you could just type in any title online and find it. (The film doesn’t mention it but there were once firms akin to private detective agencies advertising “out-of-print book searches”, who were allowed to charge you even if they didn’t find the book.)But this upset has caused an upsurge of interest in manuscripts, annotated editions and ephemera collections, conferring archival and financial value on items that had previously been disregarded, and which has been a boost to studies of the cultural lives of women and people of colour, helping to bring these subjects in from the margins. Now the business is not just men only, it is younger and more erse (though no one uses the hip word “curators” – it’s “collectors”) and they are convinced that reading hasn’t been killed off by Netflix.The sharpest interviewee is the bibliophile and collector Fran Lebowitz, who supplies a couple of insights. “You know what they used to call independent bookstores?

The Arsenal goalkeeper was 22 when, in November 2014, injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina afforded him his first crack at the top level. He was outstanding in a win over Borussia Dortmund before keeping clean sheets against West Brom and Southampton. Arsène Wenger was sufficiently impressed to decide that, if another three points followed at the then Britannia Stadium, the imposing youngster would keep his place despite Szczesny’s return. But Arsenal crumbled in familiar fashion and, while little blame could be attached to Martínez in their 3-2 defeat, Wenger reverted to what he knew.Until last Saturday, when Bernd Leno’s injury necessitated a 50-minute outing as a substitute, Martínez had made only made two further appearances in the Premier League. Now he has a chance to amass at least another eight, with Leno almost certainly sidelined for the rest of the campaign, and those who have worked with him during his decade in north London are adamant that he is no stopgap Martínez, they say, has what it takes to become Arsenal’s long-term No 1.Mikel Arteta agreed on Tuesday, pointing out that anyone who was not ready to become first choice “wouldn’t be the No 1 at Arsenal”. The nagging doubt, looking objectively at the career of a 27-year-old with only 90 professional appearances and 26 for his parent club, is that something must be wrong: is the player ambitious or, for that matter, good enough? But there would be few eyebrows raised within the club if Martínez used his own stroke of fortune and pushed seriously for the position he has never written off.Martínez came to Arsenal’s attention during the 2009 South American Under-17 Championship in the Chilean city of Iquique. Their scout Francis Cagigao – who turned up Cesc Fàbregas and Gabriel Martinelli, and is the now the head of recruitment – had another target in mind before Martínez, drafted into Argentina’s side due to an injury, staked his claim. He was brought to London for a two-day audition with the then goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton upon turning 18 and quickly signed from Independiente for a sum that – including a sizeable appearance-related fee paid this season – stands at around £1m.Arsenal’s staff had a good feeling about Martínez. They liked the way he used his 6ft 4in frame maturely for one so young and saw the potential of his laser-like “side kick”, a technique often seen in Latin American goalkeepers. The raw materials were present in bundles and so, according to one figure closely involved at the time, was “an inner hardness” that he has certainly gone on to need.While Szczesny, Ospina, Lukasz Fabianski, Vito Mannone, Jens Lehmann, Manuel Almunia and Petr Cech have been and gone, Martínez was shuttled around on six loans, the time never quite right to give him a serious first-team opportunity upon returning from any. He was lent to Rotherham, then struggling in the Championship, for the end of that 2014-15 season, with Arsenal’s coaches telling their second-tier counterparts in complete seriousness he would keep them up. They were not wrong, but other moves did not go as well. He began well at Wolves before hurting a thigh and a season with Getafe went less successfully than hoped, five La Liga appearances proving considerably fewer than Arsenal had been led to expect.But Reading were hugely impressed during an 18-game spell last season and Martínez returned to north London with a bounce. “When I was playing for Reading, I got this feeling of being the No 1 – and I want that at Arsenal,” he said in an interview with the club’s website last September. One school of thought around Arsenal’s training ground has been that previous goalkeepers were, in some cases, pitched into action too early. Martínez has bided his time and is deemed a more rounded inidual than some of his predecessors, living an uncomplicated family life and making plenty of allies with his sunny, yet focused, disposition.If he can convince at St Mary’s on Thursday, and help Arsenal revive their push for the European places, then he will quickly forge thousands more friendships. Another close associate of Martínez points out that goalkeepers have become so durable over the last two decades that the mid-to-late 20s can still be considered a relatively young age, emphasising that none of his coaches has doubted his potential to become first choice. Now, half a decade after seeing a leaky back line sieve his chance in the Potteries, he finally has the opportunity to prove them right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8afcfcc31803eaf94b204c6b4291a85ddd241b/0_145_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d4198eaf9b20d3432eecf3be230645","title":"manchester city v liverpool to go ahead at etihad stadium even if title up for grabs","story":"Manchester City’s game against Liverpool next Thursday will go ahead at the Etihad Stadium even if the title remains up for grabs.The decision was made by Manchester council’s safety advisory group, which said it had no objections to the match being played as planned.The SAG, which includes representatives from the council, emergency services, environmental health and supporters’ groups, could have asked for the game to be moved to a neutral venue.Liverpool will win the Premier League before that match if City fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday.

They did it twice on Wednesday, surrendering a lead in the 81st minute, then doing it again in the 89th. This after coming from behind to lead at the half.Conte gambled with his team selection, leaving out five of 11 starters from Sunday’s win over Sampdoria. A slow-motion midfield of Roberto Gagliardini and Borja Valero looked like a mistake from the outset, Filip Djuricic accelerating away to set up Francesco Caputo for Sassuolo’s fourth-minute opener.Inter had shown little sign of coming back into the game, before Jeremie Boga lost track of Milan Skriniar, swiping a boot into his opponent without even knowing they were there. Romelu Lukaku converted the penalty. Five minuts later, Cristiano Biraghi exchanged a one-two with Alexis Sánchez and ran through to make it 2-1.Even Conte must have wondered how his team was ahead. All of Italy, though, would be left flummoxed by Gagliardini’s failure to extend Inter’s lead once play resumed.Lukaku fed Lautaro Martínez down the left channel to launch an Inter counterattack. The Argentinian returned the ball to his strike partner near the penalty spot. Lukaku’s first-time effort was parried straight into the path of Gagliardini, five yards from goal. All he had to do was nudge it over the line. Somehow, he thwacked it on to the bar.It was an astonishing miss – right up there with Edin Dzeko against Palermo in 2016 and Mattia Destro for Bologna against SPAL. At least this was not the fourth minute of added time of a derby. Gagliardini’s gaffe is unlikely to be commemorated, as Destro’s was, with its own choreography, but it did cost Inter a chance to put this game to bed.Instead, they shook it awake. Ashley Young, on as a sub in the 75th minute, was lucky not to give away a penalty in the 77th when the ball struck his arm in the area. He allowed no such room for interpretation in the 80th, when he went through the back of Mert Müldür. “I never touched him, mate,” protested Young. Reality begged to differ.Domenico Berardi scored the penalty. Five minutes later, Inter were back in front, Valero arriving unmarked at the back post to help Antonio Candreva’s free-kick across the line.It could have been an ending that spoke to the resilience of Conte’s team: evidence they were ready to fight for the Scudetto. But it wasn’t. Müldür had already drawn another good save from Samir Handanovic before Giangiacomo Magnani swept home a deflected cross to make it 3-3.There was barely time to breathe before Atalanta and Lazio filled up a nation’s TV screens. For the second time in four days, kick-off at the Gewiss Stadium was preceded by a moment’s reflection to a soundtrack of Roby Facchinetti’s Rinascerò, Rinascerai (I will be reborn, you will be reborn). The game that followed could have served as an extended metaphor.Atalanta were two goals down inside 11 minutes. Marten de Roon smashed the ball into his own net from a similar range to where Gagliardini had missed from. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic casually picked out the corner of Pierluigi Gollini’s goal from 25 yards.At the time, it felt like a statement of intent. Juventus had moved four points clear of Lazio at the top of Serie A when they beat Bologna on Monday. That was already their third game back since the coronavirus interruption, with the previous two coming in the Coppa Italia. Likewise Inter, this season’s other aspiring title contender, had played three times between league and cup.Lazio had been left kicking their heels, itching to get out there and remind everyone what they were capable of. Before the pause, they had gone 21 league games without defeat. Now they were 2-0 up away to the team that sat fourth opponents who had demolished Sassuolo 4-1 on Sunday.Like Inter, though, they failed to press home their advantage. Ciro Immobile missed a pair of chances to make it 3-0, before Robin Gosens halved the deficit instead. Atalanta never looked back.It took a spectacular finish from Ruslan Malinovskyi to get them level, belted with such violence from the edge of the area that the cameraman could scarcely react in time to catch it hitting the net. Atalanta, though, were already dominating the play by that point. José Luis Palomino finally headed them in front in the 80th minute, but the outcome had long felt inevitable.Lazio’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, could not hide his disappointment, acknowledging that his team’s path to the title had become “more complicated”. That four-point lead for Juventus over Lazio, as well as the eight-point advantage they hold over Inter, was enough for some to declare the race was already at an end.It is easy for such fatalism to take hold when the team in first place has won the past eight titles. Juventus were already the favourites and their position has strengthened. On the other hand, there is still almost a third of the season to go. They have games against Atalanta, Roma and Milan in July, as well as a head-to-head with Lazio.What is true is that the fixtures have fallen kindly for Juventus in this initial phase of restart. Although the Coppa Italia ended badly, it allowed them to shake off any rust before resuming their league campaign against a spirited, but modest, Bologna. Lazio looked tired in the second-half against Atalanta – as you would expect for a group of players thrown into such a high-intensity encounter without any competitive action in their legs.None of which should be used to diminish Atalanta’s efforts. It is worth remembering they led 3-0 at Lazio in October, too, before the home side pulled off an extraordinary comeback of their own to rescue a point.Atalanta were the top scorers last season with 77 goals. They have reached the same tally this time around with 11 games to spare. Twelve points behind Juventus, they are unlikely to challenge for the title, but not even the craziest Inter can truly claim to put on a more entertaining show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440290c990d848cf2b92b1a5b0a28fa40b178887/176_281_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1525416ec1ca4f26e7876326cb323e7c","title":"he could nutmeg a mermaid the rise of brentfords said benrahma","story":"Algerian has dazzled for Brentford, having followed a familiar path through France’s lower isions, and looks Premier League-boundBe it with backheels, rainbow flicks or making the opposition look silly, few players outside the Premier League have made a bigger impression than Saïd Benrahma in the past couple of seasons. The Brentford winger boasts an endless box of tricks but he is more than just easy on the eye – he is approaching double figures in assists after equalling last season’s goal tally of 11 with eight Championship games to play. More often than not, his coup de grâce is sliding the ball through the legs of dazed defenders. “He could nutmeg a mermaid,” said Sam Saunders, the Brentford B assistant coach.The buzz around Benrahma is growing and Friday’s game at home to West Bromwich Albion brings another opportunity to impress after he scored the opening goal in victory at Fulham last weekend. In February Middlesbrough’s Lewis Wing was left hopping in frustration after being on the receiving end of a double nutmeg and, given Benrahma’s palette of pirouettes and twirls, it is perhaps no surprise he counts Ronaldinho and Hatem Ben Arfa, with whom he played at Nice, as idols.Chelsea are among those taking a keen interest in his progress. Last summer Aston Villa, whose manager, Dean Smith, worked with Benrahma at Brentford in the player’s first season in England, had a bid of about £15m rejected, with the Bees unwilling to sell both him and Neal Maupay, who joined Brighton for £20m.Benrahma was born in Aïn Témouchent, an Algerian resort on the Mediterranean popular with holidaymakers, but grew up inland in Bel Abbès, a city with a rich military history once home to the French Foreign Legion. He moved to France with his parents at the age of 11, settling in the suburbs of Toulouse, where he played for fifth-tier Colomiers, for whom his performances for the under-19s, including at a tournament in Barcelona, attracted interest from Monaco, Bordeaux and Nice. He joined Nice, making his debut as an 18-year-old under Claude Puel, who promoted him from the reserves.Ankle injuries and the arrival of Lucien Favre – “we didn’t understand each other” – halted his progress and a series of loans followed: to Angers and then Gazélec Ajaccio of Ligue 2, where he came to the attention of Brendan MacFarlane, Brentford’s lead scout in France. His flair and ability to eliminate players in one-against-one situations stood out against Bourg-en-Bresse Péronnas, against whom he scored twice and celebrated with his mother, and then came a fruitful spell at second-tier Châteauroux.Two years ago he joined Brentford from Nice for £2.7m, 12 months after Maupay made a similar move from Saint-Étienne for £1.6m after impressing on loan at Ligue 2 Brest. It is a well-trodden path and Bryan Mbeumo, a 20-year-old winger who has scored 14 goals in his first season in England after joining from Troyes for a record fee last summer, is the latest to make the transition look remarkably easy.He did not speak English on arrival and credits Maupay with a key role in his rise, particularly in helping him settle. He lives with his mother and has struck up a friendship with an Algerian chef at the training ground. Incidentally, his first professional career start came at Griffin Park six years ago, for Nice in a pre-season friendly defeat, a game in which Maupay scored. “We would find each other on the pitch with our eyes closed. I have known Neal since Nice but we were not so close then. He took care of me as soon as I arrived here and was essential to my integration. I wasn’t expecting him to make that much effort for me. He became my friend, my brother.”These days Benrahma is one-third of Brentford’s ‘“BMW” attack alongside Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins, who has led the line impeccably in the No 9 role vacated by Maupay. Algeria is enjoying a boom of talented players as a result of investment into infrastructure, namely a national technical centre on the outskirts of Algiers, and Benrahma, who has three caps, has inevitably drawn comparisons to their captain, Riyad Mahrez, the Manchester City winger who provides an obvious source of inspiration given his journey since leaving Le Havre of Ligue 2 six years ago.Benrahma, too, seems destined for the Premier League and, just like Mahrez, trying to stop him is a thankless task, as Henrik Dalsgaard, the Brentford defender, can vouch. “He’s such a tricky player, you think you’ve got him locked in the corner and then, all of a sudden, he’s out,” he said.• Who will make a late dash for the play-offs? A vibrant Derby side head into the weekend in mid-table but three points off sixth-placed Preston, whom they visit next Wednesday. Louie Sibley’s stunning hat-trick on his second Championship start helped them to victory over Millwall, who remain among a clutch of seven play-off-chasing teams separated by three points. Before then, Preston take on Cardiff, who returned with an impressive win over Leeds. “I was pumped up for the game to beat Marcelo Bielsa, because he’s the man,” said Cardiff’s manager, Neil Harris. “It is only one game and we want to build on that.”• Is the great escape on for Barnsley? Gerhard Struber’s side remain four points adrift of safety but have won four of their past six matches and host Millwall and Blackburn inside the next five days. Wigan, too, are seemingly heading in the right direction after one defeat in 10 matches, a run that includes five successive clean sheets. Middlesbrough travel to fellow strugglers Stoke on Saturday having acted on their dreadful form by appointing Neil Warnock, and things do not get easier for Hull, who dropped into the relegation zone having last week banned the Hull Daily Mail owing to “negative coverage”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6ceece18933c660b02dab90d54540038067d43/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=756526cd71d324bd286fd73b1133d608","title":"trauma and triumph my father his dementia and surviving segregation","story":"For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017I had just entered my father’s nursing-home room when he swung his head around and pronounced, “They killed that boy in Mississippi.”Not the greeting I expected. I was startled by how swiftly he turned and pinned his gaze on me. Confined to a wheelchair and the world of dementia, my father rarely moved that quickly anymore. He often would talk to me, full-out lucid conversations, without opening his eyes. But that day he looked at me intently, eyes wet and runny. Tears or discharge from an ongoing eye issue, I didn’t know.Neither did I know what he was talking about, and I felt ambushed by the simple declarative sentence about another black death at the hands of a “they” that I assumed to be police. I wracked my brain to recall the day’s headlines. Had I missed a shooting, an unexplained hanging, a suspicious suicide? There have been so many – too many to remember.Then, he said, insistently: “They killed that boy in Money, Mississippi,” and gestured to the television. Sound muted, it flashed new developments in the case of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Cleveland boy killed by police in late November 2014 as he played with snowballs and a pellet gun in a park. With the “Money” reference, I realized that my father was conflating Rice with Emmett Till. Another black boy, big for his 14 years, considered a threat and accused of “provoking” his own lynching in 1955 when a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, lied that he’d approached her sexually.It would do no good to correct my father the brain on dementia doesn’t always respond to reason. My father had vascular dementia. Different from the more common Alzheimer’s disease, it’s a form of cognitive and physical decline often caused by multiple strokes. Those strokes might be virtually undetectable until, cumulatively, they result in brain damage, confusion, and impaired mobility. When my father was diagnosed, a kind doctor told us that his brain was functioning like a camera shutter that’s constantly misfiring – sometimes fast, sometimes slow, collecting thousands of impressions that it couldn’t process or organize. But that didn’t mean that all memory was lost.This was the case with my father, who died this spring at the age of 86. His historical memory was remarkably intact. He could remember a football game from decades ago, the shebeen called Hell’s Half Acre that he frequented as a young, wild-oats-sowing man (the same place he tried to take my mother, who said, “I’m not that kind of girl” and demanded to be taken elsewhere). But he sometimes got stuck in a time machine.I realized, as my father spoke with a firm voice and brimming eyes, that he was of an age with Emmett Till. Could have been an older brother. I mulled turning off the TV or turning it to a sports channel. Distraction and ersion are your friends when a loved one has dementia. I wanted to dislodge this memory that defined his generation in the way that the killings of Trayvon Martin and George Floyd have and will define later ones.For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017.I trotted out all the techniques I’d been taught by “memory care” experts. I changed the subject gently and agreed pleasantly when he seemed agitated, an old conflict-resolution trick called “fogging”.I left, thinking it had worked, until I heard that my father refused to have a white certified nursing assistant (CNA) bathe him.“She might say I’d try to rape her,” he said.My father became irate when a CNA said things like white women’s unfounded rape allegations against black men “didn’t happen”. He knew it did, from both the impersonal arc of history and family experience. Soon after, when my father had a bad reaction to steroids, he lashed out at his caregivers, shouting about the mistreatment he’d suffered as a black man born during the 1930s in rural Appalachia.I think of this moment often now, as I see and hear black elders talk about this latest racial spasm in our society and their lives. I worry for African American seniors like my father, who are living with dementia and struggle to make sense of eating breakfast. Or those who live in nursing homes where they are one of the few black residents (for years, my father was the only black man in his). I wonder if they see modern-day uprisings and are mentally catapulted into the fires that burned cities in 1968, if they see police brutality and marches, and think of the daily indignities of Jim Crow.I know that my 74-year-old mother does. Since George Floyd’s death, she’s commented multiple times about white children spitting on her from school buses she could not ride, how the state of South Carolina was so fixed on ridding the state of future “problems” that it paid the difference between in-state tuition and her out-of-state fees (better if educated Negroes went out of state and stayed there).A friend told me that her senior mother abruptly packed her bags and fled the city she lived in, going to the country town of her upbringing and resettling among her people. Maybe to flee Covid-19, maybe to find succor in open spaces and familiar faces. And these women, my mother included, don’t have dementia.My mother can talk about her feelings and sort through them consciously in a way my father couldn’t. I got to better understand his racial wounds as a survivor of segregation – and maybe we should think of black people of my parent’s generation just this way: as survivors. I heard more about the things that made him through the loss of inhibition that made him both irritable and so affectionate. My father told me that he loved me more as he declined. I heard about his adventures hunting, running bootleg liquor across state borders to earn money for graduate school, the fast pitch that almost took him to the Negro Leagues, the difficult horse he broke and trained.Dementia gave me my father in a new way. It also took him away.I cherish the times I have with my mother and listen to her stories of trauma and triumph. I’m proud that she goes to a therapist to talk to people who aren’t her children. My mother also has the Southern gifts of well-rehearsed public politeness and meaningless, cordial chitchat. Recently shopping in a grocery story, she had a brief encounter with a white woman customer, around her age, that gave her pause.“We were just saying hi to each other, in the aisle. We both had our masks on, and we were saying ‘How are you?” And I said, ‘These are trying times.’ She said, ‘Are things THAT bad for black people?”’ – a sign of both white oblivion and a pandemic-driven thirst for conversation.There’s little precedent for the multiple hits that everyone is taking now — with Covid-19 and police violence taking many black lives. Many black elders of the civil rights generation are aware that they are extremely vulnerable to coronavirus, but they may be hard to reach with the latest and best information.Boddie said: “The main thing is socialization. We have people who live in our housing and want to go in common areas together, who go to the grocery store as a group. We can’t do our chair exercises in a group. It’s hard to say to a grandmother that her grandson can’t come in and visit.”Boddie’s own grandmother, formerly a South Carolina native, celebrated her recent birthday, thanking God for seeing 90 years and not having coronavirus.In the past, she had her own domestic ritual to support civil rights activists – and it’s one she’s replicating now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74761d0d1d2fd4eb3c803d4a05edf88d303cae07/0_150_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb2dd2c96d5dec5639e10f8722d6436","title":"coronavirus lockdown eased 4 july england pub hairdresser gym","story":"People in England will able to visit a pub, restaurant or hairdresser, but not a gymThe government has announced an easing of lockdown rules in England from 4 July. Hospitality and leisure businesses will be allowed to reopen, and there will be more freedom to see other people.From 4 July you will able to go to a pub, cafe or restaurant, visit a museum, library or theme park, watch a film at a cinema, or stay in a hotel or on campsite – as long as the venue can open safely. You can also be part of a group meeting at a place of worship. If you need to sort out your lockdown hair, you will be able to go to a hairdresser or barber.You can’t go to the gym or do any type of exercise class – the risk is still too great to allow people to breathe heavily while in close proximity. The risk level also means that you can’t watch a play, except on a screen, or live music. Soft play areas will still be closed, as will activities that involve sharing or borrowing equipment – for example bowling or ice-skating. In more bad news for anyone trying to shake off any lockdown pounds, swimming pools will remain closed. Beauty salons, casinos and nightclubs won’t reopen yet, nor will cricket clubs. If you are a church goer, you will not be allowed to sing at services.Yes – and friends. But it is complicated. You will be able to spend time indoors or outside with another household, either at home or at a pub or restaurant. If you are outside at a pub, you can meet up to five people from more than two households, but if you are inside the two household rule applies. Social distancing of 1-metre-plus will apply in all cases.If you are already in a support bubble, that will count as one household so you can all visit another set of friends or family. You can stay overnight at someone’s home and there are no restrictions on how far you can travel to see people. But again the 1- metre-plus social distancing rule applies.Yes, over-70s can meet others under the easing, but they have been advised to remain especially cautious as their risk of complications if they do get Covid-19 is higher than for younger people.The government says the fall in the number of infections and the fact that the R rate – the number of people each virus-positive person infects – has remained below 1 means it can reduce the social distancing guidance for England. Instead of insisting that businesses cater for people to stay 2 metres apart, the guidance has been reduced to 1-metre-plus. This means that people can be closer as long as there are other safety measures in place – such as more handwashing facilities and screens at venues, or you could be asked to wear a face mask or sit so you are not facing other people.It’s a yes to staycations – you can stay overnight at holiday homes and second homes, book hotels, caravan parks and campsites, and tourist attractions can reopen. You can visit one other household, as long as you maintain social distancing.As for trips abroad, the government is in discussion to create “air bridges” with other countries, which would allow people to travel without quarantining, and an announcement is expected in the next few days. The countries being considered include holiday favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece.At the weekend Tui said it would resume trips to Spain and Greece on 11 July, suggesting that the ban on travel could end by then.In Wales there is no date set for pubs and other leisure outlets to reopen but tourism businesses have been told they can open on 6 July and take bookings from 13 July. It’s a similar situation in Scotland, although tourism could reopen in the middle of the month. In Northern Ireland pubs, cafes and restaurants can reopen from 3 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f6bf277254e4902df5bb46ede4f46f97f1fa23/0_50_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c75fc1bbbf8137a4a8eb66c848b7917b","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

Founder Ethan Diamond explains how he did itIn the decade afterwards, the music industry remade itself in Spotify’s image. Streaming services – including YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer and Tidal – signalled that the era of ownership was over. Who would want dusty vinyl or external hard drives if they could have all the music they wanted on their phone or laptop for a low subscription price? The result of this shift, as musicians from Taylor Swift to Thom Yorke to Joanna Newsom have complained, has been paltry payouts for artists and a consolidation of power among tech companies. Spotify has rarely turned a net profit, but it has 130 million paid subscribers and managed to scrape together $100m for a recent deal to host podcaster Joe Rogan exclusively.Meanwhile, Bandcamp has become the rarest of Silicon Valley stories: a slow-burn success. The early years of the site were defined by outsiderdom –\u0026nbspvideo game soundtracks, internet-born genres such as vaporwave and seapunk, music for the “furries” subculture of people who dress as animals\u0026nbsp– and you can still find pretty much anything, from pirate metal to eco-grime. As well as downloads, about half of Bandcamp’s sales are for physical items – vinyl, CDs, cassettes, T-shirts, posters, USB sticks, even MiniDiscs. “The growth of the company has been almost comically steady. For 11 years it’s a line like this,” says Diamond, holding his hand out at a gentle incline. “This year will be the first year where there’s a noticeable change in the growth rate, and that is because of the pandemic and the awareness that has been raised around the need for fans to directly support artists.”Miles Opland, head of Bristol-based experimental dub label Bokeh Versions, got together with his Avon Terror Corps collective to donate sales from a “name your price” compilation to homeless charities in his city. Along with sales from his own label, he ended up giving £2,000. “It was really important for our community to feel like we could get together and do something, even though we were all stuck in our houses separately,” he says. “With Spotify, it wouldn’t be possible to do any fundraising because everything is so siloed off. I have no way to communicate with anyone who streams our music. I don’t have a way to post messages.”In contrast, Bandcamp is all about interaction – fans are invited to leave reviews, share their collections and send and receive messages from artists they follow. “People feel like their money is going somewhere, and not getting lost in this big black box of royalty nightmares,” says Opland.Spotify has now introduced a “tip jar” on artist pages, encouraging listeners to directly donate to artists or to coronavirus relief efforts. Diamond doesn’t know if Spotify’s gesture was influenced by Bandcamp. “Regarding other services’ similar efforts, I support anything that helps get artists paid,” he says carefully.\u0026nbspBandcamp is Diamond’s second winning bet, launched after he sold his first company, an email service called Oddpost, to Yahoo in 2004. With his tousled hair and horn-rimmed glasses, he’s more stylish and genial than the stereotypical tech entrepreneur. He’s a genuine music lover, too – a former saxophone player who likes to browse the racks at Groove Merchant in San Francisco. In February last year, Bandcamp opened its own record store in Oakland to sell physical releases from the site. “We can’t have every record on Bandcamp,” says Diamond of the bricks-and-mortar space in Oakland, “because the inventory would be twice as big as the Tower Records in Tokyo, which is a nine-storey building – and that’s just to have one copy of each record.”\u0026nbspThis cornucopia is investigated on Bandcamp Daily, an editorial arm launched in 2016 to shine a light on the mind-boggling variety and volume of uploads to the site. With music magazines and websites battered by budget cuts and layoffs, the Daily has ended up as one of the few remaining outlets for serious writing about everything from sludge metal and power ambient to Black Appalachian banjoists and modern Māori music.So is Bandcamp going to save the music industry? Absolutely not, according to musician and writer Damon Krukowski – and that’s for the best. He is suspicious of the desire to “scale up”, an impulse that is at the heart of Silicon Valley capitalism. “All the troubles with the internet, the direction it’s gone since its early idealistic days, have to do with this question of scale. Bandcamp won’t scale, in the sense that it’s not for everyone –\u0026nbspand that to me is a positive. Thank God that the CEO is amused by his steady graph, because that’s sustainability. We take the term sustainability from the environment – the whole idea of scaling up is disastrous on a global scale.”Krukowski thinks the link between Bandcamp and progressive politics is logical. The direct connection between fans, artists and labels, whether it’s leaving a positive review or paying an extra few pounds because it’s your favourite artist, is about “being an agent, rather than a passive participant,” he says. “When you have not surrendered your agency, it makes perfectly natural sense to think, ‘What can I do with that agency to take some action?’”Support for the fundraisers is widespread, but, with around half of Bandcamp’s sales coming from outside the US, the focus on American causes hasn’t gone unnoticed. One critical artist, who asked to remain anonymous, comes from a label that has put out hundreds of albums of ambient music and amassed a significant international fanbase. “As a non-American,” he says in an email, “I object to the idea that my music is used by Bandcamp to push what are essentially American political messages, regardless of whether I agree with the spirit of the message. I view it as a form of American cultural imperialism that is ignorant of the international user base.”The artist has set up a separate webstore to underline what he sees as an unhealthy dominance of the underground music market. “Bandcamp should be a tool to help artists and labels achieve an end, not the cultural statement in itself. What began as a liberating force is starting to fester into a rigid dead end, stifling the creative freedom of artists by indirectly and facelessly demanding they comply with the cultural standards they dictate to us.”Generally, support for Bandcamp among artists and fans is high. Independent record shops may be monitoring the situation with caution, but if people are willing to empty their wallets when their favourite artists are struggling, they’re probably also enthusiastic about supporting record shops. If they choose to spend £5 on a Bandcamp download that they could have for nothing, then those fans aren’t just a market – they’re a community.More than once, Diamond makes the case that music “is essential for humanity. If you’re serious about that, then the welfare of artists is essential,” he says. “It can’t be that music is a commodity, or content to use to sell advertising or a subscription plan. Artists have to come first.” Bandcamp has become a lifeline for artists doing something different, cooking up new ideas with little regard for trends, scenes or playlists. The streaming services aren’t designed for music like that. “They’re never going to pick out the thing that’s different,” says Krakowski. “Freaks on the music scene do that, music writers do that, really skilful radio programmers do that. But the algorithm is never going to do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838d67a5496864c99486329efc29c918 620w","title":"boris the narcissists narcissist flails wildly as pmqs exposes cracks","story":"The PM can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir StarmerWhat a difference a day makes. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson had been in his comfort zone. The Mr Bright Side telling the Commons more or less what it wanted to hear and getting little pushback even from opposition MPs. The saviour releasing the country from months of hibernation. Trusting everyone to still observe the essentials of social distancing even while they were getting pissed in newly-opened pubs and bars.Prime minister’s questions, though, exposes Boris’s fallibilities. Not because he is too lazy to properly prepare and isn’t nearly as clever as he imagines himself to be – though both of those things are true – but because the very idea causes his psyche to go into meltdown. Johnson is the narcissists’ narcissist. He believes in his inalienable right to do whatever he pleases. Even the merest hint of a challenge is an insult to his fragile ego.Someone more self-aware might realise that the coronavirus is nowhere near half-done. That mistakes have been made and others may well be in the future. That the pandemic can make fools of anyone and a degree of humility might be in order if he is to keep the country onside in the weeks and months ahead. People can forgive a lot if they feel they aren’t being taken for mugs. But for Boris any admission of failure or liability is a psychological impossibility.Asking Boris to take responsibility for his own actions is pointless. He just can’t do it, because he is the centre of his own universe, locked into his own closed system of thought. What he wants he must have. So it follows that whatever he does must automatically be right. People who disagree with him or are no longer useful to him are easily discarded as inconveniences.The trouble is that Boris can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir Starmer. For the first time in his life, Johnson has come up against an immovable object. And rather than accept the inevitable, Boris has merely allowed himself to regress.Initially he saw the Labour leader as a mild inconvenience – an unwelcome intrusion into his alternative reality – but, after discovering that he couldn’t make him go away with mockery, a few cheap gags and by trying to turn the session into an interrogation of Starmer, his feelings have turned to hatred. Keir has got under his opponent’s skin. Somewhere in Boris’s subconscious he knows that Starmer is both better briefed and a great deal sharper and he can’t bear it. So all he can do is lash out, flailing wildly, tilting at windmills.Part of Starmer’s skill is to keep things simple. His questions have a logic that even a 10-year old can follow. It’s just a shame that Boris is still stuck in the toddler age of development. The Labour leader began by pointing out that easing restrictions was all very well providing that the track-and-trace system was functioning properly. Which at present it wasn’t as it was missing two-thirds of cases. So how did the government propose to get it working properly by 4 July? Boris was outraged. How could the person who had offered him cautious support the day before dare to now challenge him on the detail? That was the kind of disloyalty only he was allowed. The Labour leader just kept plugging away. This wasn’t obstruction, it was constructive criticism, he observed, as he reiterated the point that he was quoting from the government’s own data and wasn’t interested in the one-third of the system that was working. He then moved on to the app that had been downgraded in the past few weeks from critical and world-beating to “additional support” before observing that the prime minister had misled the house on the child poverty figures last week and would he mind correcting himself. Just for the record.All that Boris had to offer was histrionics and lies. Gestures of feigned “What me Guv?” innocence, combined with blatant untruths. Boris still labours under the impression that if you tell a lie often enough then it somehow becomes true. But what might work on the campaign trail on the side of buses just doesn’t cut it when you’re supposed to be the prime minister during the greatest health crisis for a century.We reached full-on meltdown shortly after Johnson claimed he had never said the app would be anything other than “icing on the cake” – since Boris begins each day as a tabula rasa, he must think the rest of us are equally amnesiac – when he went back to the tactic of asking Starmer about schools that had been moderately successful the week before. Only this time it failed dismally as Starmer had long since answered it.The few dozen Tory backbenchers in the chamber kept their heads down. They were as embarrassed as Boris would have been had he the capacity for that level of empathy. It’s slowly dawning on most Tories that Boris just isn’t up to the job as they witness their leader unravel at PMQs week after week. Nor do many have much faith in his ability to make the right calls at the right time with the pandemic. And having used up what little goodwill he might have had – Boris has never bothered to conceal his contempt for most, make that all, of his colleagues – his support is dwindling.Too many more PMQs like this and something will start to give. And as Boris is incapable of change, then it can’t be long before his suitability for the job comes under scrutiny from his own party. It was probably always inevitable that the person who would ultimately destroy Boris was Boris himself. But Starmer is doing a great job of exposing his faults. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9902d6a2af850c018b2050ac3a888ed7bee058d2/0_136_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e499ea047cd436fe6daed96219fb3372","title":"dominic cummings could face inquiry over special advisers","story":"Exclusive: MPs asked to examine whether PM’s chief of staff exerts excessive control• Gazza, Caino and Roxstar: the strange world of Dominic Cummings’ ‘spads’Dominic Cummings is facing a possible parliamentary inquiry following claims No 10 is exerting excessive control over ministers’ special advisers, the  has learned.The FDA union, which represents more than a dozen “spads”, has asked the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to investigate why the prime minister’s chief of staff has been given extra powers. It follows concerns that Cummings, on behalf of Boris Johnson, has centralised power in No 10 and is impeding the roles of cabinet ministers and parliament.According to latest government figures, there were 109 special advisers in December, more than half of whom were new to government, costing just under £10m a year. In the past, cabinet ministers typically hired and oversaw their own special advisers, who are political appointees paid from the public purse, though the prime minister approved all appointments.Since September, the Cabinet Office has required advisers to sign new contracts, which say the responsibility for their conduct and discipline will be jointly held between the appointing minister and the PM’s chief of staff.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, has written to William Wragg, chair of the committee, saying there is mounting evidence that the role of spads has been radically altered to break the link with ministers and put Cummings in charge.“We have a cadre of special advisers with little security of employment and who are being directly managed by No 10 through the PM’s chief of staff. Even without the concern over how this power over employment is being deployed, it is clear that there is a deliberate approach from No 10 to fundamentally change the nature of the role,” he wrote.The committee has agreed to examine the complaint, which could result in Cummings being asked to give evidence to MPs.The FDA letter claimed that weekly meetings for special advisers, chaired by Cummings, are being used to enforce the idea that spads are now run from Downing Street, not by ministers.“There was a consistent message that special advisers were being directed in their work and essentially centrally run. The conduct of these meetings was also criticised as being overly confrontational,” Penman wrote.Following the election, Penman added, spads were being used as a central resource and moved around different departments by No 10.“This resulted in some special advisers being left without posts, and concern that the process for determining who stayed, moved or left not only lacked transparency, but was being used to exert control and dilute the relationship between minister and adviser,” he wrote.One former permanent secretary told the  there was a belief in Whitehall that Cummings was forcing out independent-minded advisers to create a pool of spads who could keep an eye on departments. “The concept of ‘No 10 narks’, placed in departments to keep a close eye on ministers and civil servants, is gaining ground,” he said.Cummings is facing a sex discrimination claim from Sajid Javid’s former special adviser Sonia Khan, after she was frogmarched out of Downing Street by a police officer last year. Javid resigned as chancellor in February after refusing to fire all five of his advisers.Before Johnson, special advisers were chosen by ministers themselves and worked directly to them, but were ultimately hired by the PM.In a further development, the Conservative party has launched a new process for the hiring of media and digital staff using the website www.spadjobs.uk.In a break from tradition, the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy will do the initial recruitment. Paul Stephenson, a founding partner of the firm, was director of communications for the Vote Leave campaign.Though the initial screening will be done by Hanbury, the new intake of spads will only be appointed if the government’s director of communications, Lee Cain, approves, which is said to be the normal hiring convention. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment.Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaigner who worked closely with Johnson during the general election, has faced intense criticism for driving 260 miles to Durham with his sick wife during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and making a further 52 miles round trip to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight.A spokesperson for the select committee said MPs were considering whether to hold an evidence session or launch a full inquiry in light of a backlog of inquiries because of Covid-19.No 10 did not respond to a request for a comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27d5c0b79a2876caa555d78fb50a38010b9bf7cb/0_203_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9c5563a5adea9a73fd3eef429f02d1","title":"britain beyond lockdown can we become cleaner coronavirus","story":"As Covid-19 accelerates the shift towards renewable energy, Jonathan Watts hears how this change risks causing intergenerational injustice in AberdeenLike many young people in Aberdeen, Mike Scotland dreamed of a well-paid job on a rig in the North Sea, the oil and gas field that has made his home a boom town for most of the past 40 years.In February, the 28-year-old finally landed the position he had always wanted at Shell and was due to take a helicopter to the Shearwater platform in July, once he had completed training.“I don’t think I have ever been as excited about anything in my life,” he recalled. “All I ever wanted was to land a health and safety role on a rig. I really wanted to make a difference.”Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off.He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns minimum wage.“I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said the man, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago as well as increasing social pressure to rein back fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.No age group is immune from the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.Timothy Robinson is a 62-year-old petroleum geologist, who has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in AberdeenIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand across the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.But a  callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to ersify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.“It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea but the number of such flights is far down compared with six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. But last week he was laid off after more than five years employment at a major oil service company.He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.”He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but is seething at his experience.He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now, he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said.He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance,” he said.The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said.She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest-ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a wind farm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest wind farm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.Colette Cohen, the chief executive officer for the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.“From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.”Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.”One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.Earlier this week, Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for the young as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen with long-term scarring for communities across the country, and for our young people in particular,” the chair of the group, Benny Higgins, said.It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he is throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.“I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.“I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up. People have had more time to be at home and to think,” he said. “We have to expect the worst and hope for the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6261ab38effea7e72a27e1c314fd5319a3b6271/0_84_4482_2690/master/4482.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cf61db0530025121c7d599bdba23d175","title":"novak djokovic left isolated as adria tennis tour acrimony rumbles on","story":"Novak Djokovic couldn’t buy a friend on Wednesday – at least not outside his tight circle of confidants and family in Belgrade, where the row over his virus-hit Balkan charity fortnight slid further into denial and acrimony.First to his side was his father, Srdjan, who tried to shift the blame for the fiasco on to Grigor Dimitrov, the first of three other players to test positive for coronavirus in Croatia, where the two-week tour was abandoned minutes before the final on Sunday.“How did the infection come about?” Djokovic Sr said on RTL’s Croatian TV network. “Probably because Dimitrov arrived sick, from who knows where. He was not tested in Zadar, but somewhere else. I don’t think that’s right. He brought great harm to you in Croatia, and to us as a family, and to Serbia.”At Wimbledon, meanwhile, the new regime took a more kindly if firm view of their blundering 2019 champion, who is quarantining in his home city for two weeks while coping with Covid-19, along with his wife, and contemplating the evaporation of goodwill that launched his well-meant venture.Richard Lewis, who hands over to the All England Club’s first female chief executive, Sally Bolton, in August, said protocols at the US Open in August and Roland Garros in September “will be easier to enforce and observe than they otherwise might have been”. And, while he shied away from saying Djokovic had a special responsibility to the game as its title-holder, he said: “It’s a fact in this day and age that all sportsmen and sportswomen have a leadership role that goes with the territory. It is disappointing.”The notion that the virus itself has bypassed the Balkans came under further scrutiny on Wednesday when another high-profile Serb athlete, the NBA star Nikola Jokic, had to delay his return to the US after testing positive. Jokic spent time with Djokovic during the Belgrade leg of the Adria Tour.Elsewhere, five footballers from Red Star Belgrade revealed they had contracted the virus 12 days after playing in the local derby against Partizan in front of a crowd of 18,000 on 10 June, about the time Djokovic’s tour was getting under way in the Serb capital. Neighbouring Montenegro, which had been declared virus-free, later confirmed a minor outbreak there after fans returned from the Belgrade football match.There was little respite for the world No 1 anywhere outside Serbia. Paul Annacone, who has coached Roger Federer and Andy Murray, told Sports Illustrated: “I think there’s a lot of his peer group who are scratching their heads. His passion to do something good clouded all the information, all the science. It was a good cause, driven by the right reason, but the end result was pretty disastrous.”The world No 35 Guido Pella is the latest player to take Djokovic to task. “He played with many people’s health and crossed a line from which it will be challenging to return, disrespecting the world of tennis and the entire planet,” he is quoted as saying on tennisworldusa.org. “I don’t know how he’s going to get out of this.”For Djokovic the party that rumbled joyously in a Belgrade nightclub two weekends ago is over. But the hangover lingers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff267075b03d3ef1c472ed65956fc095667a9451/1315_116_2185_1310/master/2185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6118fdc8c8aab6f9e66ff7ecaa74ada9","title":"talking horses aidan obrien outlines plans for quick derby double","story":"Record-seeking trainer could rely on Russian Emperor, Mogul and Vatican City at Epsom, but Mogul’s prep has been rushedRussian Emperor, Mogul and possibly Vatican City look like forming the core of Aidan O’Brien’s challenge for the Derby a week on Saturday. Victory for the Irishman would break the trainer’s record of seven wins in the Epsom race, which has stood since Robert Robson was the first to reach that total in 1823, but O’Brien lacks an obvious star and the first three in the betting are trained in England.The difficulty this year is that the three major European Derbys will take place over a period of just eight days, starting with the Irish version on Saturday evening. Speaking in a webinar organised by Curragh officials on Wednesday evening, O’Brien said it was unlikely that he would ask any horse to run in the Derby just a week after competing in Ireland.Asked about his Epsom plans, O’Brien began by saying: “We’re thinking of running back some of the Irish Guineas horses in Epsom.” That race was just a fortnight ago and the trainer decided this weekend’s Irish Derby would come too soon for the likes of Vatican City, second in the Guineas. Though he did not mention them by name, he may also be considering Epsom for Armory, fourth in the Guineas, and the pacemaker Fort Myers.Of Russian Emperor, a winner at Royal Ascot, O’Brien said: “He looks to have come out of it well. He hasn’t done a lot, one little bit, he seems to be in good form. Entries for Epsom are on Monday. We have him down to be entered at the moment. So far, he seems to be in good form.” O’Brien made no mention of the French Derby a week on Sunday, for which Vatican City is currently second in the betting and Russian Emperor third.He appeared more concerned about the rushed preparation given to Mogul, a beaten favourite at Ascot. “He needed two runs, really, before the Derby but we weren’t able to get two runs into him. So we ran him in the toughest race over a mile and a half and we’re kind of asking that race to do two races’ job.“We had worked him as hard as we could but some horses need racing to get them there. He was very vulnerable going to Ascot but we thought, going to Epsom, he probably had to have a tough mile and a half somewhere. We just felt that was as tough as we could give him and at the same time give him a chance to make it back.”O’Brien named six horses as potential runners in the Irish Derby: Arthur’s Kingdom, Dawn Patrol, Tiger Moth, Santiago, Mythical and Serpentine. Adding spice to the rest of this weekend’s action at the Curragh, his intended runners include Magical, having her first race since winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October, and Sovereign, not seen since his shock 33-1 success in last year’s Irish Derby.He confirmed that Love, the impressive 1,000 Guineas winner, was on course for next week’s Oaks, so long as the ground does not go soft. Peaceful, his Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, is more likely to wait for the Irish Oaks later in July.Meanwhile, English King, the Derby favourite, has had a getting-to-know-you gallop with Frankie Dettori, recently booked to ride him at Epsom. The colt’s trainer, Ed Walker, said: “Frankie just wanted to come down, get a feel for the horse and he really liked him. He really wanted to get inside the horse’s head and understand him, which is a mark of Frankie’s professionalism. He rode him for well over an hour, they got on great.“He loves his personality, because he’s got a really big personality. He’s a playful horse, he’s not a boring horse, who just plods around the gallops. He’s a fun horse.”The money has been coming this morning for Exotic Escape (2.45) at Haydock, after the same connections had a well backed winner there on Wednesday. This three-year-old showed promise on her first start since leaving David Lanigan for David Loughnane, staying on bravely into fourth at Chelmsford after racing wide and far too free in the early stages.Today’s extra furlong helps and Hollie Doyle is booked. As at 9.30am, the best available is 11-2, as the influential Hugh Taylor tipped her up half an hour earlier.At Leicester tonight, Buzz Killington (6.55) could be overpriced at 14-1 on his first start since joining Grant Tuer from Noel Meade. Just two starts ago, he beat 13 rivals at Dundalk, although the blinkers fitted that day have been left off here. A mile and a half was too far on his only start since and he has since had a wind operation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807fe7fbe81ad77545e9a9e6554887782bacab0b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa7f50683726eeaae71aa7293efed7d","title":"qanon facebook conspiracy theories algorithm","story":" investigation finds more than 3m aggregate followers and members support QAnon on Facebook, and their numbers are growingIn early May, QAnon braced for a purge. Facebook had removed a small subset – five pages, six groups and 20 profiles – of the community on the social network, and as word of the bans spread, followers of Q began preparing for a broader sweep.Some groups changed their names, substituting “17” for “Q” (the 17th letter of the alphabet) others shared links to back-up accounts on alternative social media platforms with looser rules.More than just another internet conspiracy theory, QAnon is a movement of people who interpret as a kind of gospel the online messages of an anonymous figure – “Q” – who claims knowledge of a secret cabal of powerful pedophiles and sex traffickers. Within the constructed reality of QAnon, Donald Trump is secretly waging a patriotic crusade against these “deep state” child abusers, and a “Great Awakening” that will reveal the truth is on the horizon.QAnon evolved out of the baseless Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which posited that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a Washington DC pizza restaurant, and has come to incorporate numerous strands of rightwing conspiracy mongering. Dedicated followers interpret Q’s cryptic messages in a kind of digital scavenger hunt. Despite the fact that Q’s prognostications have reliably failed to come true, followers rationalize the inaccuracies as part of a larger plan. Q’s initial commentary on the Facebook bans was concise: “Information Warfare,” Q posted on the website 8kun. Two days later, in a post that included a collage of dozens of news headlines about the takedowns, Q went further, speculating that there had been a “coordinated media roll-out designed to instill ‘fear’” in believers and dissuade them from discussing QAnon on social media. “When do you expend ammunition?” Q wrote. “For what purpose?”The anticipated purge never came. Instead, QAnon groups on Facebook have continued to grow at a considerable pace in the weeks following the takedown, with several adding more than 10,000 members over 30 days.These groups and pages play a critical role in disseminating Q’s messages to a broader audience and in recruiting more believers to the cult-like belief system, researchers say.“Facebook is a unique platform for recruitment and amplification,” said Brian Friedberg, a senior researcher at the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Project who has been studying QAnon for years. “I really do not think that QAnon as we know it today would have been able to happen without the affordances of Facebook.”Moreover, Facebook is not merely providing a platform to QAnon groups. Its powerful algorithms are actively recommending them to users who may not otherwise have been exposed to them. did not initially go looking for QAnon content on Facebook. Instead, Facebook’s algorithms recommended a QAnon group to a  reporter’s account after it had joined pro-Trump, anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown Facebook groups. The list of more than 100 QAnon groups and accounts was then generated by following Facebook’s recommendation algorithms and using simple keyword searches. The Instagram accounts were discovered by searching for “QAnon” in the app’s discovery page and then following Instagram’s algorithmic recommendations.Receiving QAnon recommendations from Facebook does not appear to be that uncommon. “Once I started liking those pages and joining those groups, Facebook just started recommending more and more and more and more, to the point where I was afraid to like them all in case Facebook would flag me as a bot,” said Friedberg. Erin Gallagher, a researcher who studies social media extremism, said she was also encouraged to join a QAnon group by Facebook, soon after joining an anti-lockdown group.Facebook did not directly respond to questions from the  about its policy considerations around QAnon content. “Last month, we took down accounts, Groups, and Pages tied to this conspiracy theorist movement for violating our policies,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We also remove Groups and Pages that violate other policies from recommendations and demote in search results. We’re closely monitoring this activity and how our policies apply.”The company also claimed that “all of the Pages” and “the vast majority of Groups” documented by the  had been removed from recommendation algorithms prior to the ’s query. The company did not provide evidence for this claim, which is contradicted by screenshots of pages and groups appearing in recommendations that were taken in May.  also continued to receive recommendations to join additional QAnon groups after its initial query to Facebook.Asked about this discrepancy, Facebook said that the pages and groups in question had been marked as “non-recommendable” as of 8 April 2020 for violations of policies against clickbait, viral misinformation and hate speech, but that a page or group can be restored to eligibility for recommendations if its behavior improves for several months.To Friedberg, the window for Facebook to act on QAnon may have already passed. “I’m starting to wonder if we’re just waiting for the next shoe to drop – another act of violence,” he said. “That seems to be what the platforms wait for, and that in and of itself is terrifying.”While QAnon thrives on Facebook, another social media site took timely and decisive action against it. Nearly two years ago, Reddit, the link-sharing network of interest-based message boards, carried out a site-wide purge of QAnon – and made it stick.Reddit had been central to the development of the QAnon movement, which began in October 2017 with the emergence of “Q” on 4chan, the anarchic image board that has served as a launching pad for memes and internet culture but also racist extremism and harassment campaigns. Q, whose cryptic messages and predictions claimed to be based on a high-level government security clearance, quickly decamped from 4chan to the even more extreme 8chan, where believers could read Q’s latest “crumbs” directly from the source.Q went briefly silent in 2019 when 8chan was forced offline in the wake of the El Paso massacre, but re-emerged on the new site founded by 8chan’s owners, 8kun.Anonymous internet posters claiming to be high-level government officials are not entirely uncommon in recent years, other so-called “anons” have emerged with claims that they were revealing secrets from inside the FBI or CIA. But Q is the first such figure to have achieved such a broad audience and real-world political influence. This is largely due to the activism of three dedicated conspiracy theorists who latched on to Q’s posts in the early days, according to an investigation by NBC News. These activists worked to develop a mythology and culture around QAnon and cultivated an audience for it on mainstream social media platforms. Reddit was significantly easier to use for the kind of crowd-sourced research and interpretation that forms the core of participation in QAnon, and the site was host to a large pool of potential recruits, such as the 1.2m members of the subreddit rconspiracy. It had also long enjoyed and at times even earned a reputation as one of the danker cesspools of the social web, for years tolerating communities known as “subreddits” dedicated to sharing non-consensual sexualized images of women or advocating rape.But the violent anger of adherents to QAnon crossed the line for Reddit in less than a year. On 12 September 2018, citing its ban on content that “incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses”, the company banned 18 QAnon subreddits, the largest of which had more than 70,000 members.Social media bans are often difficult to maintain, but Reddit’s move was uncommonly effective. Today, QAnon remains unwelcome on Reddit, with the few subreddits that address it dedicated to either debunking the theory or providing support to people who have lost friends and family members to QAnon.QAnon did not disappear after Reddit pulled the plug, however. Instead, its believers moved on to other platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Discord and – crucially – Facebook. At the time of the Reddit ban, one of the largest closed Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon, “Qanon Follow the White Rabbit” had 51,000 members, according to NBC News. Today that group has grown to more than 90,000 members.And while YouTube and Twitter have played an important role in providing a broadcast platform for QAnon content, the specific structures provided by Facebook are uniquely suited to the participatory “work” of engaging with QAnon. Facebook also provides QAnon with an even larger pool of potential recruits than Reddit could, especially for the somewhat older, Evangelical crowd that has proven susceptible to QAnon’s messaging.Will Partin, a research analyst with Data \u0026amp Society, and Alice Marwick, a professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, describe QAnon as a “dark participatory culture”, which is to say that it is a community that takes advantage of the infrastructure of social networking sites to bring disparate people together and foster discussion, collaboration, research and community, but directs those energies toward anti-democratic, regressive and even violent ends.“Everything about our research suggests that these people are not irrational they’re hyper-literate, even if they’ve come to beliefs that are empirically inaccurate ,” Partin said. “That’s partly because they have a fundamentally different epistemology to judge what is true and false.”The digital architecture of Facebook groups is also particularly well-suited to QAnon’s collaborative construction of an alternative body of knowledge, Friedberg said. The platform has created a ready-made digital pathway from public pages to public groups to private groups and finally secret groups that mirrors the process of “falling down the rabbit hole or taking the red pill”.“You can mechanically take those steps,” he said. “Very few of the contemporary Q-following base actually need to engage with 8chan at all.”While Facebook has policies banning hate speech, incitement to violence and other types of content that it considers undesirable on a family- and advertiser-friendly platform, QAnon does not fit neatly into any single category.Much of what is shared in QAnon groups on Facebook is a mix of pro-Trump political speech and pro-Trump political misinformation. Memes, videos and posts are often bigoted and disconnected from reality, but not all that different from the content that is shared in non-QAnon, pro-Trump Facebook groups.The pages and groups that were removed in early May violated the company’s ban on “coordinated inauthentic behavior” – ie the kind of digital astroturf tactics that Russian operatives used to support Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. Those rules are aimed at operations in which actors make false representations about their identities in order to mislead people – a description that could encompass Q – but Facebook only applies its policy to deceptive behavior that occurs on its platform, not on 8kun.To enact a blanket ban akin to Reddit’s under its current rubric of rules, Facebook would likely have to designate QAnon as a “dangerous organization” – the category it uses to ban both terrorist and hate groups and any content published in support or praise of them. QAnon is hardly an organization, though as a movement it has certainly caused harm and could be considered dangerous.There are innate societal and inidual harms to convincing people of a version of reality that is simply false, as QAnon does, said Data \u0026amp Society research analyst Will Partin. “When a common sense of what is real and what is correct breaks apart, it becomes nearly impossible to reach a democratic consensus.”And QAnon followers’ enthusiasm for misinformation is not confined to politics as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the groups became a hotbed for medical misinformation – something Facebook has claimed to be working hard to combat. Analyses by Gallagher, the social media researcher, and the New York Times demonstrated how QAnon groups fueled the viral spread of “Plandemic”, a 26-minute video chock full of dangerously false information about Covid-19 and vaccines.Facebook’s algorithms appear to have detected this synergy between the QAnon and anti-vaccine communities. Several QAnon groups are flagged with an automated warning label from Facebook that reads, “This group discusses vaccines” and encourages users to go to the website of the Centers for Disease Control for reliable information on health.It appears that anti-vaccine propagandists are also taking notice, and attempting to capitalize. Larry Cook, the administrator of Stop Mandatory Vaccination, one of the largest anti-vaxx Facebook groups, has begun incorporating QAnon rhetoric into the medical misinformation he peddles, as well as making explicit invitations to QAnon believers to join his group.Cook has begun referencing the “deep state” and stoking fear of forced vaccination and “FEMA camps”.“I have discussed the concept many, many, many times that vaccines destroy our connection to God and that we are in a spiritual war with Principalities of Darkness that have a death wish for our children, and humanity at large,” he wrote in one QAnon-inflected post. (Cook also uses the site to aggressively promote his various products and a subscription-only platform for “medical freedom patriots”.)But the potential for damage from QAnon goes well beyond. For those iniduals who truly believe in the QAnon narrative, the crimes of the “cabal” are so grievous as to make fighting them a moral imperative. “They’re talking about a group of people who are operating our government against our wishes and they’re molesting and torturing children and destroying our society,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science who studies conspiracy theories. “It’s an incitement to violence.”Indeed, there have been numerous incidents of real-world violence linked to QAnon, and in May 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat in an intelligence bulletin. While anti-government conspiracy theories were not new, the bulletin stated, social media was allowing them to reach a larger audience, and the online narratives were determining the targets of harassment and violence for the small subset of iniduals who crossed over into real-world action.Despite this, Uscinski is skeptical of the idea that kicking QAnon off Facebook would help anyone. He regularly polls conspiracy theories and consistently finds that QAnon is “one of the least believed things” out there, well below belief in theories about Jeffrey Epstein’s death, anti-vaccine hoaxes, and Holocaust denialism. Uscinski also cautions against overly exoticizing the QAnon narrative, noting that “most of the component parts of QAnon have been around forever”, with parallels in the Satanic Panic of the 1980s or the plot of Oliver Stone’s JFK. And he’s concerned about the free speech implications of censorship by tech platforms.“It’s a potentially dangerous belief it’s very disconnected from reality I don’t really think we want more people getting into it,” he said of QAnon. “Do the internet companies bear some responsibility? Yes. Would it be better if they took it down? Probably. Does that take care of it? No.”Partin said that he generally favored Facebook taking a “more aggressive approach to moderation”, including addressing the recommendation algorithms and trying to reduce the spread of misinformation out of dedicated conspiracy communities and into the mainstream.“If Facebook flipped a switch and every Q post disappeared tomorrow, that probably would be harmful for QAnon,” he said. “But there is resiliency built in. Getting deplatformed is harmful, but the idea that it would somehow make this disappear is fanciful.”In May, Republican voters in Oregon nominated a QAnon believer to run for the US Senate in November. Another QAnon supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is likely to be elected to the House of Representatives after she came first in a Republican primary in a conservative Georgia district on 11 June.“In some ways, the second that Trump officially acknowledges QAnon is the second it becomes a partisan political issue that Facebook may not be able to take action against,” said Friedberg. “We’re watching a normalization process of these conspiracies, and I think the beast that is Facebook was really the answer to this all along.”Indeed, Trump himself has repeatedly retweeted QAnon accounts on Twitter, which believers take as confirmation of their alternate reality. And on 20 June, just before Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump’s adult son Eric posted a QAnon meme on his Instagram account. Eric Trump deleted the image relatively quickly, but not before screenshots spread across the Facebook Q-sphere.“So Eric Trump posted a pic with a ‘Q’ in the imagery,” an administrator of one of the larger QAnon groups wrote. “The pic has been taken down but the message was received!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceae7912d683b62b4477b8563ff13b63959c09f1/395_567_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96580e84de31c0e91f19ddf92788c773","title":"withings sleep analyzer review advanced sleep tracking made easy","story":"Track sleep, heart rate, snoring and even sleep apnoea with a zero-maintenance mat you stick under your mattressSleep tracking has become an important piece of total wellness monitoring, but typically requires strapping devices to your wrist or head. Withings Sleep Analyzer records your sleep and heart rate, plus is one of the first devices to monitor sleep apnoea, all without you needing to attach anything to your person.Instead, the £120 Sleep Analyzer is a sensor-packed slim mat that you slide under your mattress. Once it’s there you simply go to sleep as normal.The mat is 637mm long, 190mm wide and only 5mm thick, so easily slides between your mattress and base (including slatted bases), positioned around where your chest lies. It tracks your breathing, heart rate and movement with a pneumatic sensor, and your snoring and sleep apnoea with a sound sensor. It then syncs the data via wifi to your Withings account and the accompanying Health Mate app when you get up.Set up is simple using Health Mate on iOS or Android. Put the mat in place, plug it in, find the mat via Bluetooth in the app and then wait for it to inflate and calibrate. The process takes about five minutes.You can’t feel it in bed and can barely see it, as just a thin USB power cable pokes out from under your mattress, which plugs into an adapter. The cable is long enough to stretch to the nearest plug, even if it’s on the other side of the bed.The tracking is automatic, so all you have to do is get into bed and sleep as you usually would, which is the beauty of the Sleep Analyzer system. You can completely forget about it and just pick up your data when you need it.Your data is securely synced and stored in your Withings account, but can be synced from there with other apps and combined with fitness data such as steps from Google Fit and Apple Health, among others.You get a colour-coded graph showing your periods of being awake, in light, deep and REM (when you dream) sleep over time, an overall sleep score each night out of 100 and a rating in words, such as “restful night”. But you also get data broken down into sections including duration, depth, regularity, the number of times your sleep has been interrupted, the time it took you to go to sleep and the time it took you to get up after waking.Each section has a traffic light system: green dot for good, orange for average and red if it’s been a bad night. They can be expanded for more information, too, such as a range of what was good and bad, comparisons with previous nights and some simple advice.Those are the basics of most sleep trackers and the Withings matches the data from various other wrist-borne sleep trackers including Garmin and Samsung watches pretty well. The Health Mate app presents the data in a way that makes it fairly easy to follow what happened overnight, and gives an average of sleep scores and sleep time over the last week or month. What it doesn’t do is provide much in the way of guidance on how to improve your sleep beyond the most obvious things, such as maintaining regular hours, keeping noises to a minimum in the bedroom and the temperature low.Beyond basic sleep stats, the Sleep Analyzer also measures your sleeping heart rate, with an accuracy matching wrist-borne heart rate monitors, as a good measure of overall health: the lower the better to a point.You can see a chart of your heart rate for the night, but also see the trend over the last quarter. My average sleep heart rate has decreased by two beats a minute over the last quarter, for instance. Here Withings has more advice covering health, fitness, diet and other bits, which can help you find out why your sleeping heart rate might be high.You can also spot things in your own charts. I can see, for instance, when I’ve been ill as my sleeping heart rate is higher than normal across the full night, or when I’ve drunk alcohol in the evening as my heart rate starts higher then tapers back down to normal as the night progresses.The Sleep Analyzer’s killer feature, which few other devices can offer, is tracking of sleep apnoea, something Withings recently got regulatory approval in the EU to implement.Sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing becomes more difficult when you’re asleep due to the relaxation of the muscles in your throat, which can lead to you to stop breathing. The result is a disturbed sleep where you’re often jolted at least partially awake to breathe again.For many this may happen occasionally in the night, but for some it can happen as much as 20 times an hour, which does your sleep no good at all. Many may be completely oblivious this is happening too.Each night the Sleep Analyzer watches for signs of sleep apnoea, recording events as well as snoring, which can be a precursor. The data is then presented to you on a sliding scale of normal to mild, moderate and severe. My highest over the last couple of months has been 11 events an hour, which was rated as normal to mild, but most nights are symptomless. I also don’t snore very often, but when I have the tracker has picked it up reliably.You can view your data over the last day, quarter or year, to keep an eye on it. But if the tracker detects enough sleep apnoea events it will recommend a couple of tests to estimate your risk, give you guidance on the symptoms, advice on how to improve things and lets you share a report with your doctor should medical help be needed.It’s worth noting that some wrist-borne fitness trackers with blood oxygen sensors can also track sleep apnoea events by measuring the dip in oxygen in your blood associated with them.The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a sleep tracking mat that’s simply easy to live with. Stick it under your mattress and go to sleep. It works automatically. You can’t feel it, nor do you have to wear or charge anything.The data it produces is good and the way it’s presented in the excellent Health Mate app is easy to follow and track across days, weeks or quarters. Sleep heart rate data is interesting and the ability to track both snoring and sleep apnoea without having to wear anything is the mat’s killer feature.The app provides some good information around heart rate and sleep apnoea, what it means and how to improve it, but it could do with some more effective guidance on how to turn around a trend of bad sleep, rather than letting the user work it out from graphs and stats.With sleep tracking built into many wearables, you might wonder why you need a purpose-built gadget for it. Really the Sleep Analyzer is for those who, like me, don’t like wearing devices or watches overnight. It’s not cheap, but the Withings Sleep Analyzer works great with the minimum of fuss if you want to track your sleep.Pros: comprehensive sleep tracking, nothing to wear, very easy to live with, fits most beds, tracks heart rate, monitors sleep apnoea, syncs over wifiCons: expensive, guidance on how to improve sleep could be better This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I say “we” paddled – the kids, in their kayaks, drifted downstream. But what a great trip to Orléans – the city liberated by Joan of Arc after years of English occupation – this was. We glided down the shallow, warm waters of the Loire, with only small pleasure craft, pretty towns like Gien and the occasional castle to break up the view.

I’ve been visiting, first as a spectator, then as a participant since 2014. Even without the event, Saumur is a pretty little town with a cracking château. But when it’s filled with vintage costumes, music and bicyclettes, it’s transformed into a carnival of colour. The festivities start on the Friday evening with 1950s live music and dancing in the vintage “village” overlooking the bridge over the Loire.

The Democratic National Committee said in a statement that official business, including the votes to nominate Biden and his yet-to-be-named running mate, will take place virtually, with delegates being asked not to travel to Milwaukee.It’s the latest sign of how much the Covid-19 pandemic has upended American life and the 2020 presidential election, leading Biden and the party to abandon the usual trappings of an event that draws tens of thousands of people to the host city to mark the start of the general election campaign. Not even during the civil war or second world war did the two major parties abandon in-person conventions with crowded arenas.Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, said the drastically altered convention won’t be an impediment. “Vice-president Biden intends to proudly accept his party’s nomination in Milwaukee and take the next step forward towards making Donald Trump a one-term president,” she said, adding that Biden’s campaign will continue to highlight Wisconsin as a key battleground state.Democrats had offered strong signals before Wednesday that they’d curtail convention activities, including when Tom Perez, the Democratic party chairman, pushed back the original convention dates in mid-July.The new details were released the same day that Biden’s team announced its leadership team in Wisconsin, one of three key states that helped propel Trump to an electoral college victory four years ago. He won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes – less than 1 percentage point.Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi will serve as convention chair, party officials said.Perez said scaling back Democrats’ festivities is a matter of public health. He sought to draw a contrast with Trump’s push for a traditional convention in North Carolina, clashing with the state’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and public health officials over the details amid the pandemic.The Republican National Committee has confirmed its official business will be conducted in Charlotte. But Trump has said he plans to accept his nomination in Jacksonville, Florida, because Cooper wouldn’t guarantee Republicans the ability to host a large-scale event in Charlotte’s NBA arena.“Unlike this president, Joe Biden and Democrats are committed to protecting the health and safety of the American people,” Perez said.Besides events in Wisconsin, Democrats plan other events in satellite locations around the country to broadcast as part of the convention.Veteran producer Ricky Kirshner, who has worked on every Democratic National Convention since 1992, will lead production of the convention, including the satellite broadcasts. Kirshner has served as executive producer of the Tony awards since 2004 and the Super Bowl halftime show since 2007 he’s won nine Emmy awards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff394f5ce885a2705b011e3feb0494bccd5343c1/363_645_3908_2345/master/3908.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b2f8c93637000b42762b547316cdf416","title":"planning rules lifted for fairs markets and car boot sales in england","story":"Events can be held without planning permission under new laws designed to boost the economySummer fairs, outdoor markets and car boot sales can be held without planning permission in England, while alcohol will be widely available to take away, under what are designed to be new feel-good laws drawn up by ministers.Eating and drinking in pub and restaurant car parks will also be allowed when the business and planning bill is introduced tomorrow. The changes come ahead of what is being dubbed “Super Saturday” on 4 July, which will see the mass reopening of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and museums in a dramatic easing of coronavirus lockdown measures.The new laws are part of a series of government policies designed to help people socialise and reinvigorate the economy this summer. But serious fears remain over the risk of a second wave of Covid-19, especially amid crowds where physical distancing is impossible, as well as the impact on workers.Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said: “We have to bear in mind that for a lot of people they won’t have confidence about going to restaurants and bars. It also won’t be the same experience so we shouldn’t see the reopening as a panacea for things getting back to normal.”It comes as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told MPs that plans for “air bridges” to allow quarantine-free travel abroad are gathering pace.He told the Commons transport select committee that there would be an announcement to parliament on Monday 29 June, with criteria and clarification on how they would operate.Shapps expects to speak to representatives from the devolved nations in coming days. Wales’ current five-mile restriction on travel – which would make it difficult for many to travel to an airport – will be discussed.New elements added to the business and planning bill, to be announced tomorrow, are designed to help businesses serve more customers outside and increase street trading. As well as summer fairs, car boot sales and outdoor markets not requiring planning permission, measures will be taken to help English councils pedestrianise streets so these events can be set up easily, the government said.Temporary changes to licensed premises will allow people to take drinks off-site, something which is typically banned in England through town by-laws.On Wednesday, sector-by-sector guidance for 4 July reopenings was issued, necessitating separate facilities for household groups in hotels and hostels, the use of screens and regular cleaning. Hair salons have been urged to keep the volume of piped music low to avoid customers and staff needing to shout, which creates an increased Covid-19 risk.Ahead of the hospitality sector opening its doors however, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), warned that the new guidance was creating “chaos and confusion”.“For our sector, 4 July might end up being more ‘doomsday’ rather than the ‘independence day’ that the prime minister is envisioning,” he said.“We are now grappling with operational guidance that places unworkable conditions on customer behaviour. This will make it highly challenging for the businesses to re-engage, meaning many venues will simply be unable to open and trade profitably,” he said.Trades unions complained that, unlike the reopening of other sectors, they had not been consulted on the new regime for the hospitality sector.The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “The governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all working closely with trade unions to keep workers safe.“England’s workers deserve the same commitment so it is totally baffling that the Westminster government will not accept Unite’s offer to use our standing army of health and safety reps to help with safe reopening of the economy.”The TUC has also raised concerns about whether the new guidance is enforceable.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is asking for more funding for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to carry out checks to make sure workplaces are safe.Boris Johnson’s spokesman said it will be up to local authorities and the HSE to police the new guidance under existing legislation that allows them to close premises and levy fines if safety is being put at risk.Police will retain the power to break up “irresponsible” gatherings of more than 30 people – though there will be nothing to stop pubs or other venues serving more than 30 customers, provided they abide by physical distancing rules.Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union, said he was disappointed with the Conservatives announcing the new “1 metre-plus” rule without meaningful consultation with workers who will be staffing pubs, restaurants and cafes, and working on food assembly lines.He said the union was also unhappy with the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for accepting the rule change.He said: “It’s the people that have been missing from this announcement. It might suit the business lobby and it shows the pubs have a very powerful business lobby but workers haven’t been consulted.”The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, criticised the government for reopening the hospitality industry on a Saturday.“I would say that they have just come down on the side of risk, rather than caution, on the side of the economy rather than health,” he told Sky News.“The plan to open everything on a Saturday is, I think, a mistake, certainly unwise.”He added: “I am concerned about everything opening up on what Sky might dub ‘Super Saturday’. Why open everything on that day? Surely a staggered approach would have been fairer for our police force.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3544356208e7072c9edb9833bf0ce0f649904c/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=06ddb320eefc968ba360466fa1548a55","title":"macron promise to reinvent himself may not save his presidency","story":"The French president is facing a barrage of criticism from voters and colleagues. Will a leftward turn be enough?France should be proud of what its people – and government – have achieved in the battle against the coronavirus, Emmanuel Macron told the nation in his most recent address. Unfortunately, the nation seems in no particular mood to listen.With two years of his five-year term left, the 42-year-old French president’s agenda of economic and social reform – aimed at spurring growth, creating jobs and deregulating the economy – has been thrown badly off track by Covid-19.He is also battling a critical, if not outright hostile, French public an anticipated avalanche of dreadful local election results on 28 June and ever more evident splits in the centrist La République en Marche (LREM) movement that he led to sweeping presidential and parliamentary victories in 2017.Despite undeniable blunders, France has, by most measures, handled the pandemic reasonably well – and better than comparable neighbours such as Spain, Italy and Britain (although not, importantly for French voters, Germany).The country should probably have imposed its mandatory lockdown several days earlier than it did, on 16 March, and should certainly have been more honest about an early shortage of masks – and more energetic in building up testing capacity.But France contained the virus largely to the greater Paris region and the north-east was quick to propose a generous €500bn (£450m) aid package for businesses that has protected more than 11 million employees and has managed its exit from lockdown smoothly.The number of new infections has fallen steadily, to a recent seven-day average of about 450, compared with 4,500 in late March. Daily deaths have followed a similar curve since a peak of nearly 1,500 on 15 April and now average about 35. Cinemas, and all schools for the under-16s, opened again on Monday.“We have nothing to be ashamed of,” Macron said in his address on 14 June. “In how many countries was all this done? That’s fortunate and it shows the strength of our state and our social model. We can be proud of what was done and of our country.”But French voters, almost always more critical of their rulers than most, are not buying it – or Macron.The president’s ailing popularity has many causes besides his perceived errors in handling Covid-19. Having blown up France’s political landscape, crushing the main centre-left and centre-right parties on his way to the Élysée, he has no established tribe on which he can rely to back him come what may.Strongly partisan voters on both left and right loathe Macron with real passion. While he still retains the reasoned support of many in the centre, polls show a clear majority of voters, despite his recent efforts to appear more relatable, continue to see him as aloof and imperious.His LREM movement, meanwhile, is struggling to transition from raw political startup to functioning party machine. Last month, 17 MPs – mainly disgruntled former Macron supporters who believe the party, contrary to its pledge to be “neither left nor right”, is distinctly more right than left – formed a new parliamentary group.Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity is not formally part of the opposition, but has warned it will vote against the government if it feels it warranted. The move cost LREM its absolute majority and was a significant symbolic blow, even if the party still has a comfortable working majority thanks to other centrists in parliament.Nor will the second round of France’s local elections, delayed by the pandemic, provide much encouragement. In Paris, the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is on course for re-election after a disastrous LREM campaign elsewhere, one-time Macron allies face excommunication after sealing electoral pacts with rivals.For these reasons and more – even if an early Ifop poll this week saw him winning the 2022 election by 10 points against the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen – Macron’s presidency is in need of a reboot. He is uncomfortably aware that both his immediate predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, were ejected from office after a single term.Macron has promised to “reinvent” himself – and present a detailed plan for the final two years of his mandate – next month. With the positive impact of some initial reforms (such as 800,000 new jobs) set to be mostly wiped out by Covid-19, most observers assume that this will entail at least the appearance of a shift to the left.The president signalled this in his 14 June address, promising a “new path” for the second half of his mandate, heavy on greener economic policies, more social solidarity and a greater emphasis on national production. “Our first priority will be to rebuild an economy that is strong, ecological, sovereign and united,” he said, but also “founded on hard work”.Acknowledging the crisis had “exposed our shortcomings and weaknesses, our dependence on others for certain products, our organisational handicaps,” he promised “massive investment” in education, greater “technological, digital, industrial and agricultural independence” and more power to local authorities.Since it is standard practice for French presidents to sack their prime ministers to mark a fresh start, an early victim of the administration’s expected step-change could be his loyal prime minister, Édouard Philippe, a conservative who never joined LREM and is, for most French voters, clearly associated more with the right than the left.So, Macron faces a dilemma: replace a credible, well-liked prime minister (and possibly create a future rival) or risk being eclipsed as he struggles to chart a more caring, eco-friendly, post-coronavirus course in the run-up to 2022. It is not the biggest decision the president faces, but it could be one of the more significant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b43ac9139be20331e1b2ac54930af46a5293ce/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04c4aca6e69bc84459294e944571e92b","title":"out of work households 1600 worse off during covid 19 due to austerity","story":"Families falling out of work during the coronavirus crisis will get £1,600 less on average in benefits than they would have done without a decade of austerity imposed by the Conservatives.Unemployment is expected to more than double this summer to levels unseen since the 1980s, as the coronavirus crisis and lockdown controls used to contain the spread of the disease trigger the deepest recession since records began.Highlighting the scale of the Tories’ austerity drive and the stuttering recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, the IFS said cuts to working-age benefits and tax credits meant low-income households in particular had experienced stalling improvements in living standards.Finding that the impact was entirely down to benefit cuts, which offset growth in wages over the period, it said incomes for the poorest 10th of households were essentially the same in 2018–19 as they had been five years earlier in 2013–14.The thinktank warned that Britain entered the coronavirus crisis with a less generous welfare safety net, and after the worst decade for income gains for households since comparable records began in the 1960s.“We now have the dual challenge of trying to recover the ground people have lost in their careers and employment prospects, and addressing the problems we already had.”Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which funded the IFS research, said the government’s levelling-up agenda was now more important than ever and could not be left to drift as the country grapples with the coronavirus crisis.“Finding a lasting solution has taken on a new urgency as the crisis has shown how close many of us are to being swept into poverty when circumstances change,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “Throughout the pandemic our wide-ranging and generous support package has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods, with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“As we focus on fighting Covid-19 we remain absolutely committed to helping every part of the country return to growth, jobs and prosperity in a way that is safe.

I want to build this school near my home. There are many poor people around here who can’t afford to take their children to school.”“I am not educated but I like things run in a professional way.

President John Magufuli phoned to congratulate Laizer live on television.“This is a confirmation that Tanzania is rich,” Magufuli told minerals minister Doto Biteko.Tanzania last year set up trading centres around the country to allow artisanal miners to sell their gems and gold to the government.

Instead – with no warning, or chance to buy water or use the toilet – she found herself on a four-hour bus trip to Rotorua, a city 225km away, to spend her quarantine there.When she tweeted about her experience – New Zealand’s government had started to use hotels in Rotorua and the South Island city of Christchurch to quarantine returning travellers as Auckland reached capacity – it didn’t take long for responders to chide Ellen for what they saw as complaining. “Stay away from us until you’re declared safe,” one wrote. “So sorry if we don’t care about your food needs.”It was just one example of the backlash from some quarters against New Zealanders returning to the country in search of safety from the pandemic raging on other shores. In a nation in the rare position of returning to normal life free from Covid-19, New Zealanders are roiling with anxiety as coronavirus cases ratchet up in other countries, fearing the virus could be imported here. And some would rather pull up the drawbridge.“It was just baffling to me that these very fundamental, basic human needs that people would be willing to deny those in others,” Ellen said. “By no means have any of us been complaining about needing to quarantine, or the sacrifices or even the quality of quarantine. We just wanted to be told what was happening.”New Zealand was, until just over a week ago, free of Covid-19 after the last remaining case in the country was declared recovered, and had recorded 24 consecutive days with no fresh instances of the virus, drawing global admiration for prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s government. The nation has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in total, and 22 deaths.But over the past week, a slow trickle of cases has begun at the border - as Ardern and her officials warned it would - as the number of New Zealanders returning home increases.Quarantine hotels appointed to manage their two-week isolation are filling up - there were 4,200 people quarantined in the facilities as of Monday, Ardern said, with 900 more expected in the next two days.There are currently 11 active cases of Covid-19 in the country, with none in hospital - all of them returning travellers, and all but two diagnosed during routine testing at the quarantine hotels. Tensions among New Zealanders over some of the cases exploded last week when officials were forced to admit that two of them, women returning from Britain, had been allowed to leave quarantine early on compassionate grounds without being tested.Dozens of others were also allowed to leave facilities without testing before rules were tightened up, it was revealed. Now, resentment of new arrivals for - in the eyes of some - putting the country’s Covid-19 elimination status in jeopardy, combined with anger at news outlets for reporting each new quarantine bungle and complaint, has proved a potent mix.“Early on, we predicted there would be much higher levels of anxiety, but people really pulled together as this ‘team of five million,’” said Dougal Sutherland, the clinical practice manager at Victoria University’s school of psychology, referring to the phrase Ardern had coined to unite New Zealanders during a strict national lockdown in March and April.“On the other side, it seems like there’s a few fractures and splinters,” he added. “That animosity towards returning New Zealanders who might have the coronavirus is part of a fight, flight or freeze response, and the fight response really activates that anger part of it.”The country was on wartime footing, he said, and threats felt heightened. “The downside of the ‘team of five million’ is that we cast people as the out-group,” he said. “Anyone coming in from the outside is a potential threat and we respond to them that way.”Only New Zealanders, their immediate families, and certain essential workers are permitted to enter the country, Sutherland added: “They all have the right to be there.”The rhetoric of national unity – New Zealand together against the world – that Ardern successfully deployed to manage the national lockdown has been a unique part of the country’s response, other analysts said.“In New Zealand, we had enormous buy-in to this strategy that you don’t see elsewhere,” said Rodney Jones, an economist based in Auckland with Wigram Capital Advisors. “You read the British papers and you see enormous societal isions.”New Zealand had been “able to fashion consensus” about the need for a strict national lockdown, he said. “Australia has, but not to the same degree.”Now, Jones said he understood the anger about new arrivals taking issue with their conditions.“For me that’s people who finally make it to the lifeboat complaining they got wet,” he told TVNZ on Monday. “New Zealand is the lifeboat.”The government is considering making returnees pay for part of their quarantine and Jones said pressure would continue on ministers to do so.“I have seen people saying that people in quarantine should be grateful to be put in these hotels that are paid for by the taxpayers,” Ellen said. “People have said that New Zealanders have made so many sacrifices, they were in lockdown for a month, so we just have to suck it up and deal with it.”She and other returning travelers also made sacrifices during the crisis, she said she had lost her job in London and spent three months in isolation with almost no human contact in order to stay distanced from a housemate who was flouting the rules. New Zealanders have a complicated relationship with the idea of living overseas travel is considered a rite of passage for inhabitants of the small island nation, but there is resentment about it from some, said Sutherland, the psychologist.“I wonder if that’s a little bit of that tall poppy syndrome,” he said, referring to the phenomenon of high achievers being ‘cut down to size.’“You’ve been away and you’ve come back and you think you’re all that, but you’re not, you’re just one of us, so pull your head in a bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9bf7196fefbf3747c482735ad07a527f71546dd/0_508_6229_3737/master/6229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dae940b694c53b770cb430f1ea8c485c","title":"uruguay and paraguay buck latin america coronavirus trend","story":"Despite sharing borders with Brazil, small countries can claim victory against virusLatin America has become the new centre of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic but two small countries, Uruguay and Paraguay, have bucked the regional trend and can claim a near total victory against the virus.There have been just 13 deaths in Paraguay and only 25 in Uruguay so far, despite the porous land borders both countries share with Brazil, where the pandemic has claimed more than 50,000 lives.Free of the endemic corruption and political strife that has plagued most other Latin American nations in recent decades, Uruguay in March switched painlessly from 12 years of centre-left administration to the centre-right administration of its new president, Luis Lacalle Pou, who has maintained the social advances of the previous administration.Uruguay is now gradually reopening its schools and shopping malls, albeit with social distancing, face masks and massive testing.Adapting to reduced physical contact has been no small feat in a country where kisses and warm embraces are the standard mode of greeting, and in which the sharing of the mate gourd, passed around between friends and family who sip the tea-like brew through the same metal straw, is deeply etched into the national psyche.“The key to our success has been a quick response detecting and isolating cases,” Rafael Radi, one of the government’s chief Covid-19 advisers, said.Testing is so aggressive that Uruguay is fourth worldwide after New Zealand, Australia and Thailand in the number of tests conducted per new confirmed case. Uruguay conducts 1,610 tests per new case. By comparison, the US and UK conduct only 52 and 21 tests respectively.With just 882 positive cases since the virus arrived on 13 March, Uruguay’s success has earned it comparisons with New Zealand, without it having the advantage of being an island surrounded by a vast ocean. Uruguay is sandwiched between South America’s two largest nations, Brazil and Argentina, where numbers are soaring.Its “red-hot” northern border with Brazil is a special source of concern. “Brazil is the great sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,” said Radi. The 1,000-kilometre border has towns and cities pitched right on it.“Our greatest concern is the city of Rivera, where the border is only an imaginary line down the middle of an avenue,” said Radi. About 170,000 Uruguayans and Brazilians live in Rivera and its Brazilian twin city Santana do Livramento, crossing the border daily to work, shop and visit family on the other side.Widespread testing in Rivera is not replicated in Livramento. “We had one case of a Uruguayan woman who crossed the avenue to go shopping in Livramento, caught the virus there, then travelled all the way to Montevideo,” said Radi. “We had to do a lot of work to trace all her interactions.”To the west, sandwiched between Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia, is Paraguay – a country where tereré, the ice-cold version of the highly communal mate tea, is ubiquitous – which has achieved a similar success in containing the pandemic. The landlocked country of 7 million has recorded only 1,392 cases and 13 deaths to date.Dr Antonio Arbo, an epidemiologist and former health minister, said the key to Paraguay’s success had been prompt, strict government measures, accompanied by good behaviour from the majority of the population. “Closing the borders, social distancing and an initial lockdown phase were successful when we analyse the data,” he said.The government of president Mario Abdo Benítez was one of the first in the region to implement containment measures after just the second confirmed case of Covid-19 on 10 March. It has now progressed to phase three of a four-stage reopening plan with the economy greatly reactivated.As in Uruguay, preventing the virus crossing from Brazil has been a priority. Paraguay has militarised key sections of its notoriously porous border and provided obligatory quarantine centres for returning Paraguayans. More than half of Paraguay’s Covid-19 cases have been related to citizens returning from Brazil.Despite the enviable results so far, criticism of Abdo Benítez’s administration is strong. A loud public outcry over multiple scandals involving the misuse of some of the funds designated to handle the crisis has led to several high-profile resignations.Numerous irregularities were detected in the procurement of medical supplies and there are insufficient levels of vital items such as testing kits, Arbo said.Dr Carlos Schaerer, a medical association leader, said that, despite the remarkable success achieved by authorities and the population so far, Paraguay has been left in a position of vulnerability.“In circumstances in which unselfishness should come first and corruption should be left to one side, corruption has surged even more strongly,” he said. “If there is an explosion of the disease, we’re going to be helpless because we aren’t prepared.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ede4c1b46f7703870747764c7395594a9cd272/0_0_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a106bcf6879fbd2bc680deb0bb7bf56b","title":"china is reshaping the global news landscape and weakening the fourth estate","story":"Beijing’s involvement in media overseas is growing almost faster than it can be tracked – the ultimate aim is both ideological and geopoliticalKindergartens, handicrafts markets, high-tech companies, hydroelectric dams ... political indoctrination camps? These are some of the sights international journalists are whisked around when they take part in all-expenses paid tours to China. The motive of these invitations is, in the mantra of Chinese president Xi Jinping, to “tell a good China story” to the outside world.In the past, that good China story would have been told through clumsy Communist party propaganda broadcast on its state-run news outlets. But during our research for the International Federation of Journalists, we found that Beijing is increasingly outsourcing the storytelling to foreign journalists, who often end up amplifying its messages in their own languages in the pages of their own news outlets.At one roundtable discussion in Myanmar, all journalists present had been on all-expenses paid tours to China. One had been nine times. This was when we realised just how systematic and sophisticated China’s global outreach campaign had become. In fact, journalists in half the 58 countries we surveyed said they’d been on such trips. Much of the reporting that came out was positive. While some were bowled over by China’s modernity and technological developments, others said they’d signed agreements promising not to write critical reports. It’s worth noting that at a time when foreign reporting budgets are shrinking, almost all those who took part believed these tours to be beneficial to their national media.More than 120 US journalists have also been on such tours, as well as at least 28 Australian journalists. These journalists often end up doubly co-opted, with their presence harnessed for domestic propaganda purposes. Twelve reporters who visited the re-education camp in January 2019 saw their faces splashed across China’s main national evening television news bulletin as they smilingly interviewed tracksuited detainees. Across the globe, journalism unions and organisations are having their needs – whatever they may be – met by Chinese entities, often with the involvement of local Chinese embassies. This s the whole gamut from a couple of computers and tape recorders donated to one journalism union in tiny Guinea-Bissau, all the way up to a state-of-the-art studio built with Chinese funding for the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. A third of the journalism unions surveyed had been approached to sign memorandums of understanding with Chinese entities.China’s involvement in media overseas is growing almost faster than it can be tracked. There are co-productions, joint ventures, Chinese-sponsored television and radio shows, and even Chinese-funded news outlets such as the Pauk Phaw newspaper in Myanmar. Chinese companies are also using apps and browsers to capture digital audiences. In India, the UC News browser – which is in Hindi and 15 other local languages – has 50 million users. Despite clashes on the border, it is hard to find a single story on China-India border tensions. Such media ventures risk becoming chokeholds on global news delivery systems, potentially denying other narratives outside Beijing’s favoured version while embedding Chinese influence in media ecosystems far outside its borders. In this way, Beijing is reshaping the global news landscape. We often use English-language output as our yardstick, yet Beijing’s inroads in other languages has gone largely unnoticed. In recent months, disinformation campaigns are being waged not just in English, but in other languages such as Italian and Arabic. The ultimate aim is both ideological and geopolitical China is pushing its own model of journalism as an alternative to the liberal western way of reporting, at the same time as hoping to translate positive coverage of its projects into votes in its favour in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.At a time when news organisations are being pauperised, reporters who accept Chinese hospitality may risk compromising their own journalistic ideals. It is perhaps hubris that independent-minded reporters believe they can take part in these tours without internalising Beijing’s messages. Yet their very presence makes them tools of a Chinese state that uses them in domestic propaganda to shore up its own legitimacy. As China multiplies its investment in news production and distribution across the world, its advances can only weaken the “Fourth Estate” model of journalism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6d89db012c1984ecc8134e2b1ad772b039202f/70_66_4708_2826/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d9ad3b959d9dfd195142fa657fb964","title":"moscows victory day parade in pictures","story":"Russia is holding its postponed Victory Day military parade despite rising coronavirus infections.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Traffic volumes in Dublin city have returned to 75 per cent of their pre-coronavirus levels, according to new figures from Dublin City Council.The number of vehicles travelling in and out of the city at morning and evening peak times began to drop rapidly from the first week in March, hitting a low at the end of the month when strict Covid-19 restrictions on travel were introduced.At that point, when travel was restricted to 2km except for essential reasons and most businesses were closed, traffic volumes fell to just over a third of their normal levels.However, despite no change to the restrictions over the following month, traffic crept back to more than 40 per cent of normal levels at the start of May.Since then, peak-time traffic has risen steadily as travel and business restrictions have eased, with the largest jump seen from the start to the middle of this month when most shops in the city centre reopened.At the end of the first week in June, traffic was at about 60 per cent of its pre-pandemic volumes and by June 21st, it had hit 75 per cent.The rise in traffic has been matched by calls from the public for a reallocation of roadspace to cyclists and pedestrians.Since April the council has been gradually implementing a Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme”.Parking spaces and loading bays have been annexed for pedestrians, and segregated cyclepaths, protected by bollards, have been installed at a number of locations, including the Liffey quays.The council is also phasing traffic out of College Green. In recent weeks flower boxes were installed in front of the Bank of Ireland on the northbound side of the Green to protect cycling facilities from traffic.While, on Wednesday morning the bus-stop lane on the opposite side of the road, from Trinity College to Church Lane, has been reallocated for footpath space. Buses will now stop in what is an existing traffic lane, leaving one lane for traffic.More than 700 requests for “mobility measures” including footpath widening, more space at bus stops, segregated cycling facilities, and contraflow cycle lanes have been made to the council since April.Meanwhile councillors were told on Wednesday it would take 100 years to resurface the city’s roads at the current levels of investment.Government funding for the maintenance of the city’s 1,250km of roads has fallen from €7.65 million in 2011 to €5.78 million this year.Over the same period road construction costs have increased by 50 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan BetsonAn infectious diseases specialist will on Thursday warn the Oireachtas about a second wave of Covid-19 and call on the Government for greater healthcare investment over the coming weeks “to rapidly upscale in emergency department capacity and isolation room facilities in hospitals.”Professor Paddy Mallon, an infectious diseases consultant at St Vincent’s and UCD, will tell the Covid-19 special committee that a highly effective programme of rapid testing, contact tracing and community actions must become a priority “in maintaining our national biosecurity.”The medic will tell TDs that as society reopens, the public is handing back some responsibility for controlling the virus to the State and if the programme of testing and tracing “fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains provided to us through the sacrifices of the Irish people.”“We are still in the midst of a national public health emergency and our citizens are at no less risk of severe illness and death if they contract Covid-19 infection now than they were back in March,” Prof Mallon will tell the Oireachtas committee.He will tell say that there is “a very narrow window of opportunity” to learn from the lessons of the first wave and that this time must be used “wisely to improve our infrastructure.”“Failure to learn, or delays in planning and resourcing for what is ahead, would not only be potentially negligent but would be a travesty to the memories of those who have died from Covid-19, some avoidably, during the first wave,” Prof Mallon will say in his opening statement.Medical specialistsHe will call for networks of medical specialists to be established operating regionally under a common governance structure to enable “scalable, rapid regional responses to both current and future threats as they arise and evolve” and the rapid implementation of national guidelines.The HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry will tell the committee that a critical project for a new model of contact tracing and testing that will operate for the next 18 months and beyond will run over the summer months with a target implementation date in late August.It will be “flexible for any potential surges” of the diseases that may come, he will say.School closures will have a “real risk of regression” for many vulnerable children with complex needs, the Department of Education has warned.At a meeting of the Covid-19 special committee on Thursday, a senior department official will say that the loss of the regular school routine, social interaction with friends, access to teachers and vital supports are presenting risk of harming the learning, the social and emotional development, and wellbeing of these children.There are about 14,000 children attending special schools or special classes with special or complex needs.Inclusion Ireland, the support group for children with disabilities, said its survey of members found that most parents are struggling to educate and support their vulnerable children at home.It says support from schools has been variable, from “excellent to almost non-existent”, while plans for a summer catch-up programme continues to exclude some cohorts of children with disabilities and has been characterised by “poor planning leaving schools and families frustrated and in the dark”.Everything you need to know about the

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to put himself forward as a candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, the influential club of finance ministers of countries that use the euro.The Minister will be forced to show his hand because the deadline for candidacies is on Thursday, which makes for awkward timing because parties do not conclude voting on the programme for government until Friday.“It’s tricky for him. It’s a gamble,” said one EU official. “But if he runs, he would be a serious candidate.”Mr Donohoe is thought to have wide support as a potential compromise candidate among Eurogroup members, as Ireland is viewed as a middle-ground country that straddles Europe’s north-south isions on economic matters.The job involves forging consensus in the informal but powerful group and would come at a crucial time ahead of an expected downturn across the EU.Coalition formationThe campaign by Spain’s deputy prime minister for the economy, Nadia Calviño, has already kicked off, and Mr Donohoe’s supporters in Europe have been forced to grapple with the complexities of Irish coalition formation in recent days in an attempt to understand whether his candidacy is certain.Luxembourg’s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, has also been named as a potential contender for the job.Leaders Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will meet on Thursday to discuss the allocation of ministerial portfolios.If Mr Donohoe applies for the Eurogroup position, it will be taken as an indication that he is confident he will stay in the Department of Finance.Such a scenario would likely see Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath become minister for public expenditure and reform, with Mr Donohoe and Mr McGrath swapping roles when Mr Varadkar takes over as taoiseach from Mr Martin in 2022.Voting is due to take place on July 9th, by which time Mr Donohoe’s position as finance minister will need to be clear, for him to have a chance of success.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288352.1593084486!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s ability to avoid severe restrictions depends on fast testing and tracing committee hears","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Paddy Mallon speaking to the Covid-19 committe on Thursday. Photograph: Oireachtas TV screenshot A resurgence in coronavirus cases could emerge very quickly and the capacity to deal with it and avoid severe restrictions depends on the ability to test and trace contacts quickly, the Covid-19 committee has been told.Expert in infectious diseases Prof Paddy Mallon warned that the likelihood of lockdown restrictions depended on two stress tests.“The first stress test for Ireland’s capacity to deal with a resurgence in Covid-19 cases will be in August when people decide if they’re going to travel overseas or not because we will inevitably have imported cases coming back into the country.“The second big stress tests is the onset of seasonal influenza because you will get a large number of people with symptoms consistent with Covid, seeking tests at one time.”The professor of microbial diseases at University College Dublin said a resurgence could emerge very quickly like what happened in Victoria, Australia where one million people are in “almost” stay at home restriction.The Australians were scrambling to upscale their testing capacity and Prof Mallon said “we cannot got rid of all our testing capacity and expect to switch it on overnight”.In a committee session dealing with testing and tracing, he told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly: “If you get a large number of people returning to the country from overseas and you’ve a wide geographical spread of community transmission and you can’t test and contact trace efficiently the only way that you’re going to control that is by returning to mass lockdown.” HSE clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said the number of testing centres had gone from 48 to two with the number of tests gone from 100,000 to 18,000 a week because of the low community transmission.Questioned by Fine Gael TD Colm Burke, Dr Henry said they should be able to ramp up testing at “extremely short notice”. He told Sinn Féin health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly he was confident of hitting the target of 72 hours.HSE national lead for contact tracing and testing Niamh O’Beirne said services would be upscaled “if we have three consecutive days of 100 tests”. But Prof Mallon said the turnaround time should be one day for testing. The importance of containing infections at borders becomes higher as the level of transmission drops off.He warned that “if you want to maintain community transmission at minimum it’s important to have a robust screening methods at the point of entry”. He said that a different response to someone coming from New Zealand compared to Texas “might be a pragmatic approach.

Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw EPAPublicity shots of the meeting showed Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and French president Emmanuel Macron seated happily beside each other at a candlelit dining table set for two.The pair were taking advantage of the recently reopened restaurants of The Hague on Macron’s visit to the Netherlands this week: one of the first physical meetings between leaders in the EU since the coronavirus pandemic shut down normal life.The French leader’s mission was to try to make a dent in Dutch resistance to a recovery plan aimed at rescuing the European Union from deep economic damage caused by the pandemic. And it may take more than a friendly dinner to do so.The rescue plan was pioneered by France and Germany, and has been a subject of debate among the EU member states since it was formally proposed by the European Commission a month ago.It involves borrowing by the EU’s executive and distribution of funds to member states that does not need to be paid back: a generous approach to the downturn and a step towards common borrowing that some regard as a breakthrough in EU unity and a potential redress of one of the structural problems of the euro.But the Netherlands, as the leader of the EU’s so-called “Frugal Four”, has been heading up resistance to the plan, as it opposes anything that involves increased cost to the bloc’s stronger economies or smacks of taking on responsibility for debt incurred by others.The four, including Austria, Denmark and Sweden, have called for a “realistic level of spending” and want member states to be obliged to pay back any funds they receive.For many years The Hague leaned on Germany to advocate tight economic policies in the bloc. But a recognition of the unprecedented nature of the current challenge, a sense that the EU needs a demonstration of solidarity to shore up unity, and an increasing belief that the time for austerity has passed has shifted attitudes in Berlin and beyond.Not far away from where Macron and Rutte spoke stood what may be the plan’s greatest obstacle: the Dutch parliament.The Netherlands is heading for an election due in March next year, and that makes it a difficult time to extract Dutch political compromises.Far-right euroscepticism has long been the tail that wagged the dog of Dutch politics. For two decades anti-immigration and Brussels-bashing politicians have gnawed at the support of the centre-ground in the Netherlands, forcing natural moderates like Rutte into harder positions and mainstreaming a negative view of the bloc, despite the Dutch economy’s profound reliance on the single market.One key element of the recovery plan – the proposal that the European Commission should be allowed to raise its own funds through taxes such as a digital or carbon levy to pay back the rescue funds – would need to be approved by national parliaments.Campaigning opportunityA YesNo vote on an EU issue would be an ideal campaigning opportunity for right-wing anti-immigration parties such as Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy, or the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, though these days he is very much a weakened force.Baudet was a key campaigner in driving the Netherlands’ 2016 referendum on whether to approve an EU association agreement with Ukraine, a tokenistic topic that was used as a wedge issue to mobilise the eurosceptic base and deliver a bloody nose to Rutte and Brussels with a 64 per cent rejection of the treaty on a razor-thin turnout.The Dutch electorate is anything but uniform. It is fragmented into an array of groups from a party for the over-50s to the famous Party for the Animals, and, in the last election, the EU-friendly D66 and Greens increased their vote share, albeit while still emerging only the fourth and fifth largest parties in parliament.Yet so potent and ingrained is a Dutch grumpiness towards the EU, alongside a British-style conviction that the bloc should remain a quid-pro-quo arrangement of economic advantage rather than a union of broader interests, that even nominally pro-EU parties sometimes temper their positions on the issue.One of D66’s defining positions is its support for the EU. But the party joined the Dutch majority to vote against the idea of euro bonds in April after a group of nine countries including Ireland called for them.The recovery plan, which proposes once-off borrowing by the commission to be repaid by granting the executive body the ability to raise its own money, is not the leap forward in integration that euro bonds would be. But it is a step forward, and the Dutch electorate may not allow their parliament to budge an inch.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Only under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

And if, as official data currently suggests, China is able to keep future outbreaks of Covid-19 under control, then it will no doubt look to capitalise wherever possible for its own economic, commercial, and political advantage.  The existential threat facing the EU, meanwhile, cannot be underestimated. Although we have seen the EU bounce from crisis to crisis over the past 10 years, it seems that, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic – ironically a crisis originating almost certainly in China – the decisions the EU takes now will be a defining moment for the future of European integration. This combination of a China looking to exert and strengthen its global power and a Europe battling for its very survival has sadly created a truly perfect storm. And it is Italy – which was one of the EU’s most struggling countries financially pre-Covid-19, and which has been arguably the hardest hit by the virus – that sits firmly in the eye of this storm.As Italy faces its most severe crisis since the Second World War, with more than 35,000 Covid-19 deaths and its economy on course to suffer the deepest recession in modern history, there is a rising feeling within the country that it is being abandoned by its neighbours. China, meanwhile, is clearly looking for a major “satellite” in Europe, or, more politely, for a more permanent entry-point to the continent. And Italy would appear to be an obvious choice. As one of the G7 advanced economies and the second-largest manufacturer in the EU, it would be quite a catch. Put bluntly, Italy’s feelings of betrayal by its European partners, Germany in particular, seem to coincide  unfortunately with Chinese attempts to deepen its penetration of Europe. And an Italy reeling from the fallout from coronavirus, and from previous woes, may, by providing China with a willing partner on the continent, be the weak link in the EU’s approach to Beijing and to the defence more generally of European values.We have witnessed this crisis magnify the economic and political isions between northern and southern Europe that have long threatened to tear apart the EU.When Italy appealed to the rest of the EU for assistance, it was initially rebuffed. Italy, and the rest of southern Europe, had hoped for a real demonstration of solidarity from the rest of the EU early in the pandemic. And even if the EU has subsequently increased assistance in the form of financial aid and equipment, the initial hopes and expectations were by no means met. Last month, the new European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tacitly admitted this, offering Italy a “heartfelt apology” for not having done more to help.But was this act of contrition too late? With regards to Italy in particular, it is a situation that has been brewing for quite some time. Italy’s economy has barely grown since the launch of the euro in 1999. “Reforms” were imposed on the country during the financial crisis and it has seen its status as one of the “big three” founder-members of the EU, alongside France and Germany, effectively downgraded.A migrant crisis in which, again, Italy was hit hard and the EU faced accusations of a lack of solidarity, merely added to the resentment. It is, therefore, unsurprising that, long before coronavirus was a word on most people’s lips, Italy last year signed up to China’s Belt and Road initiative, a hugely ambitious scheme to drive trade links via infrastructure projects from the Far East into the heart of Europe. It was the first major Western country to do so.Perhaps fittingly, an early symbol of Italian participation in this scheme was to be found in Chinese involvement in the deep-water port city of Trieste in the Adriatic, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and ceded to Italy after it joined the Allies during the First World War. Trieste has long been considered the European terminus of the maritime Silk Road from the Far East to Europe, a key trade route for about 2,000 years until the 1700s, which is thought to be a key inspiration for the Belt and Road project.Of course, European partnership with China is not confined to Italy. George Osborne, Chancellor from 2010 to 2016, ignored US opposition and signed the UK up for Beijing’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, widely seen as a rival to the Washington-based World Bank. Neither is Italy alone in feeling bruised by its treatment by its EU partners after bearing the initial brunt of the coronavirus crisis. Spain harbours similar feelings of neglect.Nevertheless, it is Italy that will surely be the immediate battleground for any clash of ideas and ideals between China and the EU. And unless bold action is taken by northern European countries, there is a very real risk of Italy turning its back on the European project forever and potentially turning to China. The EU must take significant measures to support and protect both Italy and wider EU integration. As Donald Tusk, now president of the European People’s Party, notes: “We must save Italy, Spain and the whole of Europe and not be afraid of extraordinary measures. This is a state of emergency.” Italy itself must also look to do everything it can to be as attractive as possible to foreign investors and businesses. There must not be overwhelming bureaucracy or an ineffective legal system preventing investment into the Italian economy. Reform in these areas – in Italy and across southern Europe generally – is long overdue and cannot be delayed any longer. We must hope that EU leaders and their Western allies take action now. They will not get a second chance – especially as an opportunistic China lurks in these unchartered waters. Nicole Junkermann is the founder of NJF Holdings, an international investment companyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive destinations first set air bridges uk revealed","story":"Air bridges with a series of short-haul destinations are set to be unveiled at the weekend as the Government plots a three-stage approach to revive flying.The first tranche of bridges are expected to be with popular low-risk holiday destinations including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany, largely to re-fire the Mediterranean tourist industry from July 4, according to sources.Portugal is not expected to be included after its spike in coronavirus rates, but the bridges mean people going on holiday to the other destinations will not be required to quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK.Ministers hope the plan will enable families to start planning Mediterranean summer breaks to the most popular destinations this weekend.A larger second set of countries is expected to be unveiled next week, including other EU nations such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland along with low-risk Caribbean islands and La Reunion, a French department in the Indian Ocean, which Public Health England has identified as having minimal infections.Ministers are examining at least one long-haul air bridge to Australia, although there are difficulties over transiting in stop-over countries which could carry a risk of spreading coronavirus. Any traveller will be expected to ensure that any stop-overs are in nations with low coronavirus rates or risk having to self-isolate on their return to the UK.Ministers are also looking to open bridges to low-risk British territories including Gibraltar, Bermuda, Montserrat and the Falklands Islands as soon as possible. Even though the number of flights and demand is low, they are regarded as special cases.It is understood that countries in a third wave, such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, have been told it is unlikely that air bridges will be established before late summer.The USA, where Donald Trump has closed the borders, is unlikely to be opened until after November, although that will depend on whether states can reduce their coronavirus rates.New Zealand is planning to keep its borders closed with a 14-day quarantine until March because of fears of a second winter wave of coronavirus. That may change if a vaccine is developed and proves effective by then.The UK bridges policy is expected to be finalised at a Covid-19 strategy meeting on Thursday with Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary.Mr Shapps is understood to have been pressing for a more ambitious, bigger opening of travel corridors in the initial phase, describing them on Wednesday as a massive priority to reinvigorate the aviation industry, help rebuild the economy and enable Britons to enjoy overseas summer sun.Foreign holiday bookings have risen by 52 per cent in two weeks, according to travelsupermarket. Seven out of 10 of the top destinations are in Spain.The criteria for deciding which countries, to be published on Monday, is focused on the virus infection rate, whether it is rising or falling and whether the prospective destination has a test and trace system to limit any outbreaks and social distancing rules as strict as the UK\u0027s.It will be set against their popularity as destinations for Britons and the economic case, which could mean dozens of countries in the first two waves.Mr Shapps told MPs on Wednesday: You can see there are a lot  of complexities. I don\u0027t want to be evasive but I don\u0027t also want to give people false hope, which is why I need to wait until the end of the process and wait until June 29.The European Commission has warned that it would be discriminatory to allow travel corridors between some but not all EU countries with similar low-risk coronavirus profiles. Backbenchers are making similar pleas. Henry Smith, the chairman of the cross-party Future of Aviation group, said: I would like to see air corridors across the whole of the EU and Schengen area.The Department for Transport, however, argues that there is no legal impediment to bilateral deals. We would regard that as their problem. I don\u0027t think you can imagine Brussels trying to tell the Spanish: \u0027You can\u0027t take Britons, said a minister.The moves came as the airport ground handling company Swissport announced plans to cut more than 4,500 jobs. The Airport Operators\u0027 Association warned in a report on Wednesday of 20,000 job losses at airports and a further 100,000 in associated businesses.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), on Wednesday joined BA\u0027s parent company, Ryanair and Easyjet in a legal challenge to ditch quarantine because of the economic damage.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"patriotic duty go pub save one britains last great institutions","story":"An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a pub. Oh, those were the days!For a nation of boozers, the opening of the pubs next month brings glad tidings, and a dystopian “new normal”. Patrons could soon be queuing, supermarket-style, outside, before listing their personal details on arrival (for contact-tracing purposes), navigating one-way systems and dodging hazmat-suited barmaids. They may order their G\u0026ampTs through apps, and sit inside perspex booths to drink them. Outside, social distancing Stasi could patrol the beer gardens for signs of non-compliance.Sounds terrible, doesn’t it? And yet, I miss the pub so much, I don’t even care. When they are finally liberated, I’m half-tempted to pack a deckchair and thermos, and queue up overnight, swathed in a Union Jack, like those starry-eyed monarchists at the Lindo Wing whenever a new royal baby arrives.The PM insists supporting pubs is a “patriotic duty”, and so it is – not because this timid Government says so, but because, through no fault of its own, a great British institution is in mortal peril. Pandemic, lockdown and excessive caution have conspired to create a situation so dire that we should assume many of our favourite watering holes will never resurface from this economic maelstrom, and spend as if their – and our – lives depended on it.Britain is home to a dizzying array of pubs, a rich ecosystem in which all have their place. There’s the old-fashioned sort, where scotch eggs and pickled onions mingle with a selection of real ales as long as the wine list at the Ritz. There’s the splendour of an oak-timbered gastropub, or the spartan charm of a cheap-and-cheerful joint offering £3 pints and nothing to eat but a few salted peanuts, with a dartboard and an invariably rude landlord who will, nevertheless, sanction a bit of indoor smoking after dark.The country pub is a separate but equally vital institution. Betjeman unkindly described the “village bores more sure to roam  To village pubs than stay at home”. But we bores must go somewhere and certainly, my parents’ local, the Cottage Tavern in Ashorne, has bolstered morale with takeaways and Sunday roasts, and helped coordinate a tight-knit hub of local volunteers.The truly “faultless” pub remains as elusive as George Orwell’s fictional inn the Moon Under Water, yet many treasure a pantheon of near-perfect pubs (for me this includes the Sloop Inn at Bantham, The Union Tavern in Westbourne Park, London, and The Trout Inn, at Godstow, just outside Oxford, with its peacocks and aura of danger from the thundering weir).Public houses have always fulfilled mankind’s need for sanctuary and belonging – not for nothing does the satanic monster Grendel target the mead-hall in Beowulf. They are secular churches, binding communities together. Along with the Army and the monarchy, the pub is one of our last great institutions at a time of overwhelming systemic failure. Allowing pubs to fold through Covid-based nanny statism and neglect would deprive our descendants of their rightful inheritance.The “new normal” may be sterile and unappealing, but we must sustain the great British pub until we can provide the rapturous homecoming it deserves. Hazmat suits be damned, we\u0027ll meet again.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"devolution creating perplexing divides pandemic","story":"One of the many oddities of pandemic politics is how Boris Johnson has faced hostile questioning from MPs from Scotland and Wales even though these matters are devolved. Ian Blackford has taken it upon himself to demand action from the Prime Minister when the policy in Scotland is decided by Nicola Sturgeon and the administration at Holyrood. What happens in England is not a matter for the Westminster leader of the SNP. Indeed, he is not accountable for what happens north of the Border, either.The constituent parts of the UK have gone their own way, albeit more in timing than in substance. Ms Sturgeon has insisted upon maintaining a two metre rule in Scotland and has not yet followed England in modifying it to “one metre plus if circumstances allow” but will soon. In Wales, there is still a restriction on driving more than five miles from home which will need to end soon if the Principality is to benefit from “staycation” tourism this summer. It is expected to be lifted on July 6.Given the fact that the leaders of the four nations have access to the same scientific advice, these differences are perplexing though may be deliberate in order to make a point, which is not something their voters will appreciate. Indeed, in Scotland a public backlash has led the government to promise the return of all schools in August, when the term normally starts, without any social distancing among pupils.In England Mr Johnson has said all schools will return in September but this will only be possible with no social distancing. As we report today the Government is drawing up plans to match Scotland with “bubbles” of 30 children per class.

He said the furloughed workers faced a long interruption to their airline careers.The actions that we\u0027re taking will have a huge impact on thousands of our people. This is something that weighs very heavily on all of us, Joyce told reporters. This is something that we don\u0027t make a decision on very easily. But the collapse of billions of dollars in revenue leaves us with little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible longer term.Joyce said the airline entered the crisis in a better position than most airlines and remained optimistic about the future.Guests staying at Premier Inn this summer will be kept apart by floor markings in the communal areas of the hotel, while staff will be behind acrylic screens at check-in and wear additional PPE “where appropriate”. New no-touch key return boxes and automated hand sanitisers are among changes to be introduced by the hotel chain as it prepares to reopen on July 4. Premier Inns are, of course, not the only hotels due to open next weekend.

Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said. Morgan defended himself by saying: “That’s not why I’m asking you the question. You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak. You’re not going to do this to me, mate. Let’s keep it calm.”After Morgan called his response “aggressive”, Dizzee – laughing – replied: “This is what happens – I become the aggressive black man! I just wanted to be nice, and look how he’s behaving.”Viewers praised the rapper for “totally owning” Morgan.“Dizzee Rascal has made everyone’s morning,” one tweeter wrote, adding: ”I love watching Piers Morgan squirm for once.

Over the years, it has been criticised for presenting the Antebellum South and its history of slavery through rose-tinted glasses.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter being taken down by HBO Max, Gone with the Wind has now returned to the site, along with two videos discussing its historical context.One clip features TV host and film scholar Jacqueline Stewart, who says that while the movie was “one of most enduringly popular films of all time”, its depiction of African American people was controversial even when it was released 80 years ago.Why has Gone with the Wind been accused of racism?“Producer David O Selznick was well aware that black audiences were deeply concerned about the film’s handling of the topic of slavery and its treatment of black characters,” she said.She added that the film’s treatment of the Antebellum South as a “world of grace and beauty… through a lens of nostalgia denies the horrors of slavery, as well as its legacies of racial inequality”.The second video features a panel debating Gone with the Wind’s “complicated legacy”.Hattie McDaniel, who played house servant Mammy in the film, became the first African American to win an Oscar when she was awarded the accolade for Best Supporting Actress.However, due to racial segregation, she was not allowed to sit with the other cast members at the ceremony dinner.Gone with the Wind\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acts including Static-X, Dope, Bobaflex and Royal Bliss are set to feature.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Twitter, the band wrote: “Nonpoint is not playing the show because of the name of the show.”Since then, the festival’s organisers have removed the original advertising on Facebook, and posted a message which reads: “For the record the venues land can accommodate up to 10,000 occupancy. This is an OUTDOOR EVENT for three days We are only selling 20 per cent of that so anyone has the choice and ability to social distance.Maxine Peake: ‘People who wouldn’t vote for Corbyn voted Tory’Why the baby-making reality TV show Labour of Love isn’t so crazy“The Festival is also not called ‘Herd Immunity’ and the name no longer tied to any of our social media or promotion.”It has not yet been confirmed whether Nonpoint will rejoin the lineup following the name change.The festival’s original post read: “As humans we NEED other human contact.

Takes us all away on a trip that unless you have felt it you won’t understand.”The “herd immunity” theory posits that allowing the coronavirus to spread through the population encourages people to quickly develop immunity, becoming less likely to then pass the virus on to others.It has been refuted by many medical experts and has been rejected as a pandemic strategy in countries across Europe.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fitness gear Holidays, the area to live in, smart phones, and coffee also feature in the list as those things where sometimes, second best will have to do.But researchers from OnePoll found two thirds of those polled DO want more out of le, and the same percentage say the older they get, the less likely they are to settle for anything less than perfect.Four in  adults will only settle on somethingthey really don’t have a choice, and  per cent said money is always the decisive factor.Being too relaxed, lacking confidence, and wanting to go with the flow are also reasons why Brits don’t push to get what they want all the time.Butthey had the choice and felt able,  per cent would like to improve their financial situation, while  per cent want a better salary.One fth of adults would like to improve their relationships, and one third want to live somewhere nicer both in terms of house, and location.A spokeswoman for Lottoland added: “As a nation we’re go-getters, and striving to do better is part of who we are.Lottoland wants to mirror that by offering playing more chances to win, more flexibility and more enjoyment along the way.“In the spirit of offering more, we’re launching a special promotion for Lotto Plus players – the Multiple Millionaires Bonus Draw.

Boats could be sent on inidual missions or in groups, reaching speeds of up to  knots . In pursuit mode, it has a range of  nautical miles. The Pacic  has been used in sea boat operations from Royal Navy warships for more than  years.But the new drone version of the boat could provide a more streamlined way of carrying out its wide range of operations - and even open up some new types of missions.The boats will be controlled from a parent ship, such as a frigate or destroyer.Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said: Commencing the trials of the crewless Pacic  boat is an important stepping stone in the Royal Navys development of its autonomous capability to ensure our fleet remains at the forefront of military innovation and technology, ready to meet the evolving threats of modern warfare.The crewless Pacic  is sponsored by NavyX, the specialist wing of the Royal Navy which trials cutting-edge technology for use on the front line.The team has worked in partnership with BAE Systems, which builds the Pacic  in Portsmouth, to commission the new boat.A prototype, controlled from the frigate HMS Argyll, debuted at the DSEI defence technology showcase in London last September, since when BAE and the Navy have pressed ahead with a working model fit for the front line.The vessels control system and sensors mean a sailor should be able to give the unmanned craft generic tasking, and the boat will decide for itself how it carries out that task.Lieutenant Commander Rob Manson of the NavyX team said: The autonomous nature of this craft adds huge capability and flexibility.Brooke Hoskins, Products and Training Services Director at BAE Systems said: We are proud to support the Royal Navys autonomous requirements, which includes increasing its operational effectiveness whilst reducing the burden on, or threat to, its sailors.Trials with the new craft begin this month, followed by trials with a Royal Navy warship later this year which should determine whether the UK invests in a fleet of such craft or just a few for specic missions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years.

And eager children have ed straight back into lessons under strict social distancing rules without hassle.Thecomes in spite of teaching unions pouring scorn over moves to get all kids safely back in class by September.Headteacher Ben Hulme said tonight: “Schools like us have shown it can be done safely for both children and staff.“This is a time when unions, schools and headteachers should all be pulling together to get children back in class. To be isive makes it really dficult to get back to some safe normality.“There have been many reports about how lockdown has affected children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing — and how there’s potential for damage to be donewe don’t move quickly. That really spurred us on to get something together — and it’s working very well.“We’re really pleased to be back and I’d encourage other schools to do the samethey can.”Under the new plans, the Government aims to form “year group bubbles” in secondary schools.This would stop pupils mingling with teenagers from other year groups, while allowing classes toto their normal size.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed St Paul’s safe and swt— and called on others to take “full advantage” of the chance to open again.He told The Sun: “We have given primary schools the flexibility to bring back more children — where they can do so within our protective measures — and it’s fantastic to see some schools taking full advantage of that to maximise their capacity and invite back all pupils.”Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, heaped praise on St Paul’s — and urged other schools to follow its lead.She said: “This is a real achievement and great to see teachers working with parents to get the whole school open safely before the summer break.”The Government originally ­pledged to get all primary schools back in action for at least a month before June . But ministers had to ditch the plans over fears that the target would not be met.Militant unions have been accused of playing politics and stopping kids ing to class, instead of putting their welfare first.Department for Education data revealed , pupils were in class last month — down from . million on a normal school day.Latest figures show approximately . million attended school last Thursday — . per cent of pupils who normally attend.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Boris Johnson told MPs yesterday that education would restart fully at the start of autumn term.It was welcome news for millions of parents who have endured three months of lockdown — many juggling full-time jobs with childcare and home-schooling. Secondary schools in England have been allowed to reopen for Years ,  and  since June .Nursery and pre-school children, plus pupils in Reception, Year  and Year , started toon June .But not all schools have reopened fully. Some do not have the staff and others do not have the space.Current government guidance for schools does not require kids to socially distance within their bubble, but many schools are ignoring the advice, insisting on all pupils remaining two-metres apart.The rules planned for September would make clear that social distancing would not be required within bubbles.Instead, kids will be encouraged to limit contact with each other.Its Headmaster Ben Hulme used his imagination, created extra space on the school field and put other hygiene measures in place.Now, to the delight of parents, almost all his pupils started back on Monday. And that’s with the two-metre rule.Yes, it’s easier with a small school. But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Covid very much still in the population it’s really important that the UK continues to be cautious when it comes heading back to normal le.The researchers, working alongside health tech company ZOE, started collecting data from around one million Brits with the app since the outbreak of the pandemic.According to their latest figures, there are currently , daily new cases of Covid in the UK on average over the two weeks up to June These figures were based on , swab tests from June  to June , including  positive swabs - but dont include care homes.This weeks data points to theof a slight North   South ide as the Midlands, North West and North East all now have higher numbers of daily new cases compared to the southern regions like the South West and London which have very low numbers.It also shows that the Midlands is now the region of England with the largest number with  daily new cases.   Most of the new cases - , - were in England, while there were  in Wales and  in Scotland.

which will also be contactless - to ensure youre well enough to workout.PureGym: PureGym will space out equipment and turn some machines off to accommodate social distancing.Theyll also have boxes marked out on their gym floors to show how much space you have to work out.In addition, theyll be even more regularly cleaning in place and members will be asked to wipe down their machines with disinfectant after theyve finished.PureGym will also limit the number of customers allowed inside at one time, and theyll have a similaron their app where you can see how busy your nearest gym is.Contactless entry will be encouraged when you arrive, as well as the use of hand sanitisers.PureGym has around  sites across the UK.David Lloyd: Around  clubs have started rolling out new outdoor exercise timetables, with up to  classes being offered a week.Classes on offer will include group exercises, yoga, pilates and bootcamp-style workouts such as HIIT.There will be a maximum of five gym members plus an instructor allowed per session, and each person will have a designated area to work out in.David Lloyd has also started opening outdoor tennis courts at  sites.Like other chains, some equipment has been moved apart to allow for social distancing.Customers are also being asked to arrive in their workout kitpossible.In addition, David Lloyd has confirmed an increased cleaning routine to keep its gyms safe.David Lloyd has  gym clubs across the country - see more details about the changes you can expect here.Feelgood Fitness and Wellness Centre: Gyms will also use screens, as well as a one-way system to keep fitness fanatics safe.There will also be a strict no stop and chat rules to keep fitness fanatics safe.He also claimed that more needed to be done to make sure gyms were able to stay afloat during this period of uncertainty.Mr Sharma said that more restrictions would be ltedthe UK continues to meet tests.He said as we move forward the government is taking “calibrated, not giant steps”, to ease the country back into a normal way of living.In Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said “further assessment” was needed for the reopening of gyms.However she added that it was unlikely that this would happen before July .Earlier this week the Prime Minister announced that not only pubs and restaurants could reopen, but that hair salons would also be able to resume trading.Gym owners told The Times that the government had its priorities wrong.Where a gym can reopen safely  and many can do so far more easily than a hair salon, restaurant or pub  it must be allowed to do so”, they added.Gyms were left out of the latest announcements, as were businesses such as nail salons.Millie Kendall, chief executive of the British Beauty Council, said: Its bizarre to me as nails and beauty are so hygiene and safety conscious. Theyre probably more prepared than any other service. The government doesnt know the subtle nuances of our industry, so this news is very frustrating.Many sectors within the entertainment industry have also remained closed including theatres and bowling alleys.The Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association accused the government of opening less safe venues first and said the sector had done a lot of work to make their centres Covid-safe.This is while Cricket bosses are also awaiting updates as to when they can safelyto the game.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nadhim Zahawi made the frank admission in a bizarre bid to defend his party in a row about access to the highest levels of government. The Business Minister was asked by the BBC why aposRed Wallapos Tory voters in Doncaster or Ashfield don’t have the same access as billionaire Richard Desmond. He replied: If people go to a fundraiser in their local area in Doncaster for the Conservative Party they’d be sitting next to MPs and other people in their local authority, and can interact with dferent parts of the authority. The Tories have never made any secret of the fact people can buy access to the party - but it is rare to have such a frank statement saying so. By donating £,, donors can join the Leadersapos Group to dine in private with the PM and senior ministers. The party has always insisted there is no undue influence. Acting Leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said: It is scandalous to suggest that the most appropriate way for the public to lobby Conservative MPs is to pour money into Tory party coffers. Members of Parliament are there to serve all their constituents, not just those who can write them big cheques. It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick faces questions over his decision to approve a £bn housing development in London against the advice of a planning inspector. He gave Westferry Printworks, planned by billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond, the green light on January  - hours before a council levy kicked in that would have cost the developer around £m. Itaposs since emerged Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the scheme on his phone at a Tory fundraising dinner in November, and texted him asking him to approve it before the deadline.  On November , Mr Desmond told him we donapost want to give Marxists in Tower Hamlets council loads of doe for nothing. In an e-mail dated January , a government official said Mr Jenrick was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the levy. Mr Desmond is not accused of wrongdoing, and Mr Jenrick has insisted that while there could have been an appearance of bias, there was no actual bias. Even so, the minister cancelled his approval to avoid a perception of bias in favour of the scheme.  Mr Zahawi made his comments on BBC Radio aposs Today programme - where he insisted there was no wrongdoing. He said: “The important thing by the way is the access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision. “The Secretary of State very clearly said to Richard Desmond ‘I can’t see you, I cannot have this meeting’. “So you have to also be fair and make that clear that yes of course there was access, because there was a dinner party that Robert Jenrick didn’t know he was going to sit next to Richard Desmond in. But Robert Jenrick also said in those messages that he released… ‘I can’t have this meeting with you’. Robert Jenrick last night agreed to release correspondence relating to the Westferry Printworks development after pressure from Labour.The messages suggest Mr Jenrick made first contact with the billionaire after the dinner in November, but later told Mr Desmond he could not discuss the scheme. However, officials in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government made clear Mr Jenrick wanted to issue approval before the levy kicked in on January . After a frenetic exchange of e-mails within government, Mr Jenrickaposs office said he would be issuing his approval at .pm on January . The minister said yesterday: These documents show that contrary to the wild accusations and the baseless innuendo propagated by [Labour], and restated today in a series of totally inaccurate statements and comments, this was a decision taken with an open mind on the merits of the case after a thorough decision-making process.

Ministers will set out plans to simply the licensing process and cut red tape in England this summer through the new Business and Planning bill. But the Government faces fresh calls from unions to make sure that hospitality workers are protected against the deadly disease - and the economic fallout from the crisis. Boris Johnson has set out plans to reopen pubs, restaurants and other venues from July  after three months of lockdown have pushed many to the brink of collapse. Hospitality sector chiefs have warned that thousands of jobs have already been lost and hundreds of businesses have gone bust. Under the plans, councils across the country will be able to pedestrianise areas and relax rules so outdoor markets, pop-up car-boot sales and summer fairs will not need a planning application.  There will also be changes to licensing laws to allow many more pubs, bars and restaurants sell alcohol to drink where, making social distancing easier. Other changes include allowing hospitality venues to use car parks and terraces as dining and drinking areas so customers can enjoy their drinks and food outside. The measures, which will be rushed through the Commons, come into force before they reopen next week.  The Government yesterday published detailed guidance for businesses including pubs, hairdressers, hotels and indoor attractions on keeping venues safe for workers and visitors before July . One plan that looks to have been put on the back burner by Downing Street is mooted proposals to extend Sunday trading hours following reports in theof a mounting Tory revolt.  No.  said only that Sunday trading proposals were under review after Labour suggested the changes were not in the so-called Covid Bill. Reports claimed that Mr Johnson had been warned in a letter from backbenchers that at least  Conservative MPs were prepared to join forces with Labour to defeat any attempt to loosen Sunday trading hours.

Robert Jenrick tonight agreed to release correspondence relating to the Westferry Printworks development, planned by millionaire mogul Richard Desmond in East London. The redevelopment, said to be worth £ billion, was approved in January by Mr Jenrick against the recommendation of a planning inspector. The local council in Tower Hamlets were set to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levythe day after Mr Jenrick stepped in and approved the plan. The levy would have obliged Mr Desmond to contribute at least £ million to support projects in the area. The decision was reversed after legal action by Tower Hamlets Council and Mr Jenrick accepted his decision was unlawful by reason of apparent bias. In heavily redacted emails released by Mr Jenrickaposs office tonight, officials discussed the Secretary of Stateaposs sense of urgency in granting the approval. In one email discussion, an unnamed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government official wrote: On timing, my understanding is that [Mr Jenrick] is was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime. Another email reads: The appellant [Mr Desmond] believes that the proposal would not be viableliable to CIL charges. Text messages between Mr Jenrick and Mr Desmond reveal conversations between the pair after they had sat at the same table at a Tory fundraiser. Arranging a site visit to view the development, Mr Desmond wrote: We appreciate the speed as we donapost want to give Marxists loads of doe for nothing. In reply, Mr Jenrick warned Mr Desmond it was important not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that I may have a role in or to have predetermined them and so I think it is best that we donapost meet until after the matter has decided. In a later text message to which Mr Jenrick did not reply, Mr Desmond explicitly told the minister the urgency in having the development approved was to save money in taxes. Mr Desmond wrote: We have to get the approval before January  otherwise payment of  million pounds to Tower Hamlets, meaning we have to stop and reduce social housing. Thanks Robert, look forward to speaking soon, Best, Richard. According to the documents, the March site visit did not take place and no further communication followed because Mr Jenrick did not take Mr Desmondaposs  calls when he attempted to get in contact on a number of occasions. Thereaposs no record in any of the documents of Mr Jenrickaposs department taking an interest in the deal prior to the Minister and Mr Jenrick sitting at the same table at a Tory dinner in November . Mr Jenrick was the first to make written contact with Mr Desmond, sending a text after the event which read: Good to spend time with you tonight, Richard. See you again soon I hope. Mr Jenrick insisted the row over his involvement in the Westferry Printworks planning decision was politically motivated. But he agreed to release documents and correspondence relating to the decision in accordance with Freedom of Information rules. He said he would release all relevant information relating to the planning decision later today.It came after Labour warned the row had blown apart confidence in the planning system.Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told the Commons: The only way to put that right is for the Secretary of State to publish the evidence about what really happened. If heaposs done nothing wrong then heaposs got nothing to fear. So I hope he will welcome this opportunity to restore trust in a sector that will be so critical in rebuilding Britain after the lockdown. Mr Jenrick told MPs: I will write to the chair of the select committee outlining the timeline of events and the rationale for my decision-making pertaining to the Westferry Printworks planning decision. Alongside this letter, and after a comprehensive review of what documents might be in scope of this motion, and of the letter that he sent me on behalf of his select committee, I will be releasing later today all relevant information relating to this planning matter using the Freedom of Information Act as a benchmark.

The site on Lynn Road makes canned foods and pouched grub for general sale. LincolnshireLive reports the site was closed for  hours for a deep clean but has since reopened. A Princes spokesperson said:Our first priority is the well-being and safety of our colleagues. We have been following government advice since the outbreak of Covid- and will continue to do so.“We can confirm fourteen of our Wisbech-based colleagues have recently tested positive for coronavirus. The total number of colleagues at Wisbech is . “As soon as these colleagues were symptomatic, they were asked to self-isolate and contact the health authorities to be tested, and to be logged as part of track and trace efforts. A deep clean of the facilities these colleagues used was also conducted, alongside further stringent cleaning across the site. As an additional step, we took the responsible decision to temporarily close the whole site for  hours so a further deep clean could be completed. The site has now reopened. The spokesperson added: “Throughout the period that Covid- has presented a risk, we have implemented social distancing measures and adapted our work environment in line with relevant guidance to minimise the chances of infection within the factory. All colleagues that are able to work from home are doing so and we have taken steps to ensure we have adequate supply of PPE for our colleagues. “We remain in close contact with Public Health England and Fenland Council so they are fully informed of our approach and developments at the site.” This marks the fourth factory to be hit by the worrying coronavirus outbreak in meat processing plants.  Close working conditions and cold temperatures are said to be at the root of the problem. The Kepak plant in Merthyr Tydfil has reportedly had eight cases of Covid- this month already. Scientists believe the cold air inside the food processing factories could make those inside more susceptible. The close working conditions and ventilation problems aposincrease the risk of infectionapos. This new blow comes after Anglesey and Wrexham food plants also reported a high level of positive tests. The outbreak at the Anglesey meat plant in North Wales left  with the virus. The outbreak happened at the  Sisters chicken processing plant, which employs about  people in Llangefni on Anglesey.Around , people in Germany have been placed back on lockdown after an outbreak of coronavirus at an abattoir sparked a fears of a second wave."},{"url":null,"title":"man credits incredible 21st weight","story":"NewsMan credits his incredible st weight loss on beating Covid- and finding lovePhil Kayes, , from County Down, Northern Ireland, weighed st ½lbs but has now managed to slim down to an impressive st lbs after joining Slimming WorldShareCommentsByJonathan ColesLorraine King:,  JUN NewsPhil Kayes with his partner Nicole Mulholland \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At his biggest he weighed a whopping st ½lbs but has now managed to slim down to an impressive st lbs in just three years. Phil said his turning point was when his mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and realised he need to be healthy. He said he had previously resigned himself to dying alone but while he was on his weight loss journey he met his partner Nicole Mulholland. The civil servant, from County Down, Northern Ireland, also believes his weight loss may have saved his le after he caught coronavirus. He added that his survival was a timely reminder how important his health is. Phil was helped in his dramatic transformation by Slimming World, who recently crowned him their aposGreatest Loser apos. Despite its name, the competition celebrates the person with the highest weight loss among all the brandaposs members. Phil said: I was always bigger than my peers. I remember at school being called out by my PE teacher for being too big to play football. The weight really started to pile on though when I started university.  My size meant that my le became increasingly insular and I made up a iety of excuses not to go out. I’d avoid gatherings like parties and weddings because I just felt so uncomfortable. I knew I wouldn’t fit into a plane seat so I never travelled, even though I really wanted to. Apart from my job as a civil servant, I didn’t really do anything except hide away and eat. It was a very lonely time. At his heaviest Phil suffered a string of other health issues including pressure on his knees and sleep apnoea. His shirt size was a huge XXXXXXXXL, with a in waist. But his main worry was that should he die in his sleep and that heavy body couldn’t be removed as he lived on the third floor of his parents’ house. Phil then realised he had to do something about his weight when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He said: Mum was facing her fourth cancer battle which sadly turned out to be her last. The news sort of spurred me into action and I knew this time I had to try and be as healthy as I could - not just for her but for me as well. I was also worried thatmy mum did pass away, I wouldn’t be able to be one of her pallbearers, which was heartbreaking. She died in October , by which point I’d lost st. I know she’d be really proudshe could see me now - more than st lighter.Phil has become much more active since losing all the weight - and has started cyclingagain after a near three-decade absence from the activity. He said: Years of being overweight really took its toll on my knees and I used to take medication daily to manage the pain. I will still need a knee replacement at some stage, but I have certainly delayed the inevitable and made the operation itself more likely to be successful.  When I was st, my doctor told me it was too risky for me to have surgery because calculating the anaesthetic needed for someone my size was so tricky. Now I’ve started cycling again, I can walk without getting out of breath and I also enjoy yoga. It’s a completely dferent le to the one I had before - one that is full of opportunities, friends and adventures. Phil also credits his weight loss with helping him to meet partner Nicole, whohe found on an online dating app. He said: By far the best thing that has happened to me since losing weight is meeting Nicole. When I was bigger I couldn’t imagine ever finding love and felt resigned to dying alone. Since meeting we’ve moved in together, swam in the Mediterranean Sea, been on a walking tour of Berlin and I’ve learned to drive.  There are lots more adventures we want to tick off the list and for the first time in a long time, I’m excited about the future. Phil also thinks his thinner size could have helped him beat what he thought was coronavirus. He said that, while it was unpleasant and he was knocked off his feet, he’s not sure he would have survivedhe hadn’t lost weight. He added: I dread to think how my body would have responded. It was a timely reminder of how important my health is. Phil was encouraged to join Slimming World in July  by a friend who agreed to attend his local group with him.He said: I was, of course, nervous on that first night but it really helped to havemy friend Laura beside me.I even contacted the consultant in advance to check the scales would be able to weigh me.  The last time I’d weighed myself was at the hospital, where I had to stand on two sets of scales just to get a reading. My consultant assured me that there was nothing to worry about and she was right. Everyone was so supportive and friendly and although it was a shock to see the scales hit st, for the first time, I felt like I could do something about it. Phil soon got to grips with a branded eating plan, which enabled him to lose weight while enjoying a wide iety of foods. It includes lean meat, potatoes, pasta, fruit and vegetables. He said: In the past I’d been referred to dieticians and dabbled with intermittent fasting and restricting my portions. I would lose weight initially but I could never stick to it because I was hungry most of the time.  What was so dferent about Slimming World was that I could still eat hearty meals to satisfy my appetite while losing weight. It felt like a bit of a lightbulb moment when I realised losing weight didn’t have to mean starving yourself. I was a bit vegetable-phobic when I first joined but now one of my favourite dishes is a Mediterranean vegetable pasta - and I even tend to an allotment with a veggie patch! The group environment really helped me too because for the first time I was surrounded by people who knew how it felt to struggle with their weight. Checking in with everyone each week has been invaluable and I have learned so much from everyone. I attend virtually now that we’re in lockdown, which is really great and helps keep me on track. I couldn’t be without them. Phil attends the Bangor Slimming World group.  Philaposs diet before Breakfast - sausage roll or a sausage bap with cheese and ketchup. Full fat latte or cappuccino with added sugar. Lunch - tinned soup with - rounds of white bread, large bag of crisps and a chocolate bar or chips with cheese and lots of sauce.

While insiders have claimed the couple wonapost say anything negative about their family, royal expert Ingrid Seward has warned that Meghan and Harry will have to tell stories about their time in the royal family to justy their fees. She said: No one wants to pay to hear them sounding off about gender equality and the environment. Harry and Meghan will really have to up their ante, and they will absolutely have to tell some stories about the Royal Family. Former President Barack Obama reportedly earned almost £, for one  speech, while the Clintons averaged almost £, per appearance in  thanks to the New York-based Harry Walker Agency. They have reportedly said they will now focus their efforts on social issues such as racial injustice, in line with the Black Lives Matter movement, while continuing to highlight subjects such as gender equality, mental health and environmental concerns.  It is unclear what speaking fees will be for the Duke and Duchess, who will speak both together or inidually, the Los Angeles Times reported. A source close to Harry and Meghan reportedly confirmed the couple had signed with the agency, which industry insiders say will net them millions as they seek “financial independence” away from the royal family. It is expected they will offer their services as keynote speakers with big money corporations and community forums in future. In February, Harry spoke at an event hosted by investment banking giant JP Morgan where he revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years.

Buyers have paid up to £, for pets thought to have come from breeding farms. Many had the deadly, highly infectious canine parvovirus, along with worms and other diseases. Sellers advertising on well-known websites tell buyers to go to a car park at Maidstone Services on the M in Kent. One of the crooks, a tanned man in his s who wears a surgical mask and black gloves, is said to use aliases including Graham, Alan and Steve. Mae Goodwin, , from Tenterden in Kent, paid £, in cash for a Cavalier King Charles spaniel she called Barney – and it died of a virus eight days later. She said: “It’s just heartbreaking. The people selling these puppies must be caught.” Charities have had  reports from buyers, most in the past six months, with five dogs dying soon after being bought. They believe the crooks are operating in a gang. The RSPCA and charity Animal Protection Services have launched a probe.

Henry Long, , allegedly claimed he had been watching DVDs, including Fast and the Furious, with relatives at the time the officer Andrew Harper was dragged to his death behind a car. He allegedly said I donapost give a f*** about any of this, as he was charged with murder on September , jurors heard. The trio allegedly got rid of their mobile phones by the time police arrived at the travelleraposs site where they were arrested around  minutes after they ed from their getaway journey. Long remarked look at me, do I look like a murderer , as officers detained him, the court heard.  Prosecutors said he told clear and deliberate lies to distance himself from the horric killing. He later admitted manslaughter ahead of the murder trial. Mr Laidlaw said: Police began, in numbers, to enter the Four Houses Corner site at about :pm just  minutes or so after the three defendants had arrived back at the site in the SEAT. Henry Long along with Albert Bowers was found in a Fendt Diamond caravan in Plot  on the Four Houses Corner site. Neither man was found in possession of a mobile phone, and the police could not find any phone attributable to either defendant during their search of the caravan site. What becomes clear is that both young men had managed to get rid of their telephones - either by disposing of them or, as would appear more likely by passing them to other members of the travelling community who were not arrested.  Both were led away by other officers and at .am they were arrested again. Henry Long saying words along the lines of Look at me.

At pm I canapost remember exactly where I was but I got to Four Houses caravan site about .pm and I stayed there all evening until police came and arrested me. I was with my auntie Sammi Jo and her husband Sammy Smith. We watched DVDaposs. One was Goonies, Fast and Furious. I went bed I think around .pm. Police woke me up. I had been outside just for a cigarette but otherwise had not left. I do not believe that I have been  in a beige Seat Toledo.  I certainly have never been in it yesterday but there are numerous cars on the site. Mr Laidlaw said: Henry Long now accepts he was driver of the car. You may think, as against the evidence which the police were to gather, he has subsequently come to the conclusion that the pretence he was not involved was unlikely to be successful in front of a jury. It follows that in the prepared statement, he told clear and deliberate lies. He then made aposno commentapos to all the questions asked of him in that first interview, save for this one exchange.

I decided to go for a final dip before going home.I was topless in the sea when I saw two young women struggling to swim near rocks.

I was struggling myself and they were panicking, which wasn’t ideal in a situation like that. The incident involved two sisters and a cousin. “I was going to tell them to float, which is the best thing you can do in a rip current, but they were panicking so much it wouldn’t have worked. They were all holding hands, so I grabbed one of their hands and pulled them all on to the beach.” Jessica – who is a performer with Cornwall’s popular Rogue Theatre – added: “One of the women said ‘aren’t you strong ’ afterwards – I’m not sure where the strength came from.” The actor and singer is a regular on the nudist beach and says people watching her rescue may have seen a lot more.

After the UK sweltered on Wednesday, temperatures are set to rise even more, with highs of C expected in some areas. The Met Officeaposs UV index does not exceed  in the UK, but levels of  are expected across Devon and Cornwall today. A UV level of  is extremely rare, with levels  and  usually found in the Mediterranean, and  is considered aposextremeapos. UV levels could reach an all-time high in the UK as a result of clear skies and a lack of air pollution due to no flights amid the coronavirus pandemic. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said that UV levels will be reaching eight across many places and will be reaching nine across parts of Devon and Cornwall today. He said: Thataposs about as high as it gets really in the UK. The sun is as strong as it gets at the moment because weaposre so close to the solstice. Weaposve got peak sun strength, clear skies, plenty of sunshine - theyaposre the perfect ingredients for high UV. If the UV level reaches , Brits could burn in just  minutesthey donapost cover up. Dr Michaela Hegglin, a professor in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Reading, said the UK could see some of the aposhighest UV levels ever recordedapos today. She told the Mail Online: This is because of a combination of factors. We are at the summer solstice, when the sun is almost directly overhead at one oaposclock. UV levels this high are rare in the UK, so people with light skin should be very careful to avoid getting burnt. While UV is important for getting vitamin D and keeping us healthy, too much of it can cause skin cancer or eye cataracts. The Met Office say precautions should be taken to stay protected. A spokesperson said: The highest levels look set to be in the south west today.  So people should avoid the sun at midday, cover up, and stay hydrated. What are UV levels  UV levels , are determined by three factors: the elevation angleof the sun in the sky, the amount of cloud, dust and pollution in the atmosphere, and the amount of ozone gas in the stratosphere. According to the Met Office, UV ray are present in sunlight, and when to many of the rays hit our skin, they can damage the DNA in our skin cells. It is the bodyaposs attempts to repair these cells that causes redness and pain, also known as sunburn.   The strength of UV ies depending on where you are in the world, the time of year and on a number of dferent weather factors such as the amount of cloud cover. Small amounts of UV exposure can be beneficial as it is essential in the production of vitamin D, however over exposure of UV can lead to serious health issues. It comes as the Met Office issued a level three heat-health warning for some parts of the UK. The amber warning advises Brits to look out for others, especially older people, young children and babies and those with underlying health conditions as temperatures rocket to the low-s. It is in place until pm on Friday. The level three warning covers the West Midlands and East Midlands, with the rest of England on a level two alert.

A source close to Harry and Meghan reportedly confirmed the couple had signed with the agency, which industry insiders say will net them millions as they seek “financial independence” away from the royal family. It is expected they will offer their services as keynote speakers with big money corporations and community forums in future. Harry in February spoke at an event hosted by investment banking giant JP Morgan where he revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years. The Duke’s team had held discussions with Goldman Sachs about forming a partnership.  However, Majesty magazine editor Ingrid Seward has warned that Harry and Meghan may have to tell stories about their time in the royal family to justy their fees. She said: No one wants to pay to hear them sounding off about gender equality and the environment.Harry and Meghan will really have to up their ante, and they will absolutely have to tell some stories about the Royal Family. The have reportedly said they will now focus their efforts on social issues such as racial injustice, in line with the Black Lives Matter movement, while continuing to highlight subjects such as gender equality, mental health and environmental concerns. The Queen banned the couple from using their ‘HRH’ titles for their private work as well as stopping them from using the ‘Sussex Royal’ brand that had collected million followers on Instagram.The couple have set up a new enterprise called Archewell, named as the inspiration for their son Archie, but reportedly last week hit a stumbling block with the United States Patent and Trademark Office after submitting their application on March  who described the plans as “too vague”.

As a result, Sara Aziz claims she spent hours scrubbing at the side of her face to try and get the orange stain off - all the while glugging white wine to calm herself.The -year-old said she was adding a couple of layers of fake tan on June  in order to look good in a selfie.She sat down to rest while the tan was drying, but ended up dozing off with the mitt still on her hand. As soon as she woke up, she said she knew something was wrong as she instantly spotted the mitt. Sara looked in the mirror and was horried when she saw her reflection.The events co-ordinator from, Colchester, Essex, used everything she could think of to try and remove the fake tan stain from her face, including face wash, cooking oil and a pumice stone. The outline eventually faded after kind pals online suggested she apply lemon juice to lt the colour. Sara said: I was scrubbing my face all night and drank copious amounts of wine to deal with it.  I did my first fake tan at .am then later that afternoon I tanned again just to give it a second coat and thataposs when it happened. I thought to myself aposooh letaposs have a little sit down and let it dry offapos and fell asleep for about  minutes. Iaposd only had two hours sleep the night before because a neighbour had music on all night so I was shattered. I realised something had gone wrong as soon as I woke up and saw the mitt was on my hand. I ran straight to a mirror and screamed. All I can say is thank god for Deliveroo who were able to drop some wine off. I didnapost have any in and I needed something to calm my nerves because I looked like an oompa loompa. The tanning fail was a first for Sara, who fake tans every Thursday with a dark mousse tan and in this instance was using the £. Solait ultra-dark mousse that aposlasts for daysapos from Superdrug. She continued: I love fake tanning because it makes me feel happy and skinnier, leaposs better with a tan and all that. Iaposve fake tanned since I was , so you could say Iaposm a fake tan addict. I tan on a Thursday night so Iaposm really tanned for the weekend. I wasnapost going anywhere, I tanned just to make a selfie look good.This one says to wash off within four hours but I always leave mine on for  hours and then wash it off. I know it wonapost accelerate much after four hours but I just want that darker tan.  While trying frantically to remove the dark splodge, Sara took a quick snap and shared it with pals online to get some advice - and spent £. on a wine order delivered to her doorI decided on ordering wine as soon as I woke up and saw my face, she said. I normally drink it with lemonade so I donapost get as drunk but this time I was drinking it straight, I needed the wine because it was awful to look at my face. After scrubbing at my orange skin for  minutes I then went red, I looked like a sunset effect.  The following day, Sara says her skin felt aposamazingapos due to the intense exfoliation she went through to get the tan off.

His we Margaret died recently, and Peter wants to move from his countryside home in Denilliquin into a care home for the final years of his le. He is not entitled to a pension and needs the funds from a potential sale of his Melbourne apartment to afford the move and the costs of the care. He has to pay up front for the retirement village but says Katrina placed a caveat on the apartment without him knowing, which stops him being able to sell it. He told News: Very clever and very clever in legal terms - and solicitors and the barrister said - she is someone Iaposve never met the like of - she has an enormous capability to come up with things we never hear of.

She was also a dance examiner and travelled widely with that.#As well as Highland dance, Doreen taught twirling, tap, line dancing and majorettes, and more recently was involved with the Dundee Sparkletts troupe.Linda added: #Mum was a member of the Gay Gordon#s Dancers, Downfield Musical Society  and her highland dancers, back in the late #s and early #s, were used on some of the Alexander Brothers shows and Ronnie Coburn shows across Scotland.#She also sang across Scotland on some of these shows.#Doreen also worked for a time as a silver service waitress in Dundee and in H Samuel the jeweller.As well as Linda, Doreen had two sons, Keith and Alan, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.A spokesman for Dundee Sparkletts said: #She was an inspiration to everyone she met.#The girls at Dundee Sparkletts loved going to her class each week learning lots of techniques while having fun.#Not only was she their teacher, she treated every one of the girls as her own, building their confidence, encouraging them even when times were challenging and getting them all to believe in themselves.#Doreen#s funeral, which is private because of Covid- restrictions, is to be held next week.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We’ve seen some unbelievable matches. They’ve given us some dramatic moments over the years.“It’s one of my favourite derbies I’ve ever worked on or watched. It’s an amazing game.“All of these games would be better in the top flight – Glasgow derbies, Edinburgh derbies, Dundee derbies, Highland derbies. I think we need them all.“Look at the league and the financial troubles some clubs are having. I know Gordonmade some strong comments and, for me, you absolutely need the sides that have a good history. You need them in the top flight.“I get that itshould be done in the fairest possible way. Right now, though, the game is crumbling and it’s on its knees.“We need our biggest clubs around and we need to make sure they emerge unscathed.”BT Sport’s live coverage of the SPFL ended when the   campaign was called and Darrell – involved in the broadcaster’s Bundesliga action – admits he is gutted at how events transpired.He said: “I think it’s sad I won’t get to work with the people I’ve worked with weekly in Scottish football but, equally, I’m under contract with BT and I’m fully expecting to stay on with them so you start to put your mind to what  you’re going to be working on right away.”Ex-Dundee star Nicky Riley is top of the class after big career change\" title\"#Ex-Dundee star Nicky Riley is top of the class after big career change# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp ex-dundee-star-nicky-riley-is-top-of-the-class-after-big-career-change embed # secretdmoPRlobSr\" data-secret\"dmoPRlobSr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He did an exemplary job at St Johnstone and I would have no concerns about the Terrors under his stewardship.For now, the Tangerines will be licking their wounds, though, because this one will sting for a while.The sub-plot of Hearts’ legal action against the SPFL, which could threaten United’s promotion to the Premiership, is bubbling under the surface. While the rapid exit of Robbie for his former club doesn’t sit right with me.From a footballing perspective I can see how the move would make sense for Robbie and the Jambos – he’ll feel he has unfinished business there as a Hearts man.However, I think the problems might run a little deeper than Robbie wanting toto Gorgie.It could work out well for United, getting compensation and a new manager, of course, but there will be a lot of questions to answer from confused fans and staff alike.Just when it seemed things were settling down, United are back in disarray.It is, of course, not a positive situation for them right now but Dundee need to be thankful for what they’ve got.Last week’s statement from John Nelms will have sent shivers down the spines of Dark Blues scarred by two administrations since the turn of the century.It’s clear the coronavirus is going to have a huge impact on the club’s finances, and they are not the only ones, but they have to look at what they have in place as a huge plus.Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality\" title\"#Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-john-nelms-finances-future embed # secrettSsuFoaHq\" data-secret\"tSsuFoaHq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Boss James McPake has a playing squad which isn’t a million miles away from being ready, there is an insurance policy in place which could be a lesaver and, most importantly, the Americans are clearly committed to staying put at Dens Park.It was a realistic statement from Nelms but not a death knell or the end of his and owner Tim Keyes’ involvement with the Dee.They may have to curtail some of their grand plans, like the stadium, and might not be able to give McPake a huge budget but the club is in the safest of hands.I was bitterly disappointed with the Merseyside derby on Sunday.The quality on display just wasn’t there and without the fans, rival clashes inThe supporters make these games and watching such a massive game with fake fan noise in the background made for a strange atmosphere.This isn’t football. The sooner we get bums back on seats the better!I hope the financial impact of the coronavirus doesn’t lead to Dundee following Hibs in mothballing their academy.For me, times like this are when clubs should be investing in their young players.Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice \" title\"#Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp former-dundee-united-manager-craig-levein-would-never-say-never-to-tannadice- embed # secretjjsgqCov\" data-secret\"jjsgqCov\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

and a sports club with the majority of the firms based in the city centre and Rosemount.Aberdeen City Council transport spokesperson councillor Sandra Macdonald said: “It’s great that so many businesses have come forward and asked about installing an outdoor area and most of them said they’re working on their application.“People will be able to walk around, queue for shops and eateries, and eat and drink in outdoor areas safely around Aberdeen city centre away from traffic which in turn will help the social and economic recovery of the city.“We’ve been carrying out these works now so

towns and cities across Scotland as part of a concerted effort to reduce transmission of Covid-.”Licensed premises that wish to sell alcohol in an outdoor area are being urged to apply for the

However, I FaceTime everyone every day to make sure they are all doing okay.I also feel very lucky to be able to spend more quality time at home with my mum. Normally we would only get the evenings and weekends together, but right now we get to spend every day together which has been nice.I have tried to keep myself busy by baking cakes, going on bike rides, going nice walks and when the weather has been nice, I like to go for a swim in the beautul River Dee.Of course, I do try to do some schoolwork, but I do struggle with having no teachers to help support me. I never thought I would say this, but I am slightly starting to miss school and my teachers.I also miss doing my horse riding and seeing all my lovely friend at the yard.

We’ve extended our opening hours from am until pm just to try and cater for everybody.“Although we’ve got to be really strict with safety but we still want the client to feel pampered and enjoy it.“We are % adhering to the government guidelines.”And Rosie Robertson, co-owner of Room  salon in Peterhead, said: #We#re delighted about the announcement and excited to get up and running again.#We#re planning on how we#ll be reopening at the moment and we know we#ll be installing perspex screens which will hopefully make people feel more at ease.#We#re going to sit down virtually with everybody and work out what#s best to ensure there isn#t as many people in the salon as there would usually be.#If we have to open for seven days we will, so we can allow people to get back to earning their money.#Museums, galleries, cinemas and libraries will be allowed to open their doors to visitors from July .Lynda McGuigan, manager at the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, said while they are free to open next month they need more time to train staff.She said the extra time will be important as they gear up to welcome back visitors for the first time in three months.Lynda said: “I’m pleased we can open but it will be a dferent operation because of the rules and regulations.“We won’t be opening until August  as there are a lot changes to make because it has only been me and the collections manager working here.“I would much rather we took our time and got everything right.“We’ll be creating a one way system around the museum and there will also be hand sanitisers and signage.”And ​Alex Geddes, operations manager at Peterhead Prison Museum, said the team would have to undertake #signicant work# at the attraction before reopening.He said: #We are delighted to hear the announcement today by the first minister to confirm that museums can reopen to the public once more from July .#The team will have some signicant work to prepare for the reopening as we are keen for visitors to have a fantastic experience, but within a very safe environment.#New signage and motion sensor hand sanitisers will all be in place at strategic positions, and safety screens will be in place at the admissions area to protect our valued team members and visitors alike.#A signicant increase in cleaning will be visible throughout the day to support our health and welfare drive and promotional support is also on hand from our friends at Visit Scotland and Visit Aberdeenshire who will be showcasing the area#s wealth of interesting places to visit and enjoy.#Our commitment to safety will be paramount throughout our work and we look forward to welcoming visitors back within these walls soon.#​Councillor Marie Boulton, Aberdeen City council’s culture spokeswoman, said: #We welcome the Scottish Government#s announcement today that museums and galleries are able to re-open after July .#We#re working on our plans for reopening to ensure that our visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience. We#re looking forward to welcoming everyone back and will announce more details, including a date, as soon as they are confirmed.#Meanwhile, Visit Aberdeenshire CEO Chris Foy said the changes to be introduced next month were a “much-needed boost” for the region’s tourism industry.He said: “The announcement from the first minister gives sections of the tourism industry a much-needed boost and kick starts the beginning of a much-delayed summer season.“With self-catering and outdoor hospitality businesses able to operate from early July, there is chance to meet demand during the school holidays. There is however a long and challenging road ahead towards recovery.” vw, px\"  Dentists will be able to open from July . But Vikram Kavi from Thistle Denistry said as it currently stands the guidance is still unclear because they have not yet received advice from their own profession.He said they are “still in limbo” until they receive more clarity although said they have social distancing measures in place for patients.Vikram said: “The guidelines are quite vague still and we are looking for new guidelines from the chief dental officer.“It is typical that politicians have announced something before the chief dental officer has issued any guidelines to the profession.“We are still in limbo to a certain extent about what can be done and can’t be done. It is dficult to be a dentist right now.“The only time we can have social distancing is to limit the number of patients being seen which is what we are doing.“We make sure there is only one patient in the practice at any one time. There is a waiting room and they are taken to the surgery directly.”Meanwhile, head of cinema operations at the Belmont Filmhouse, Colin Farquhar, said the venue would be unlikely to open by the specied date.He said: #My immediate reaction was surprise. I didn#t expect cinemas to come in the same phase as restaurants and other places in Scotland, I thought it would be a few weeks later.#For the Belmont, July  would be an incredibly optimistic opening date, and obviously the dates are still provisional and could sht.#Our chief priority is safety and a lot of that will be based around social distancing measures which we will have to apply.#We put out a big customer survey last week and advanced ticket sales only was something that we mentioned as a possibility.#We have an awkward space compared to other cinema multiplexes and we are essentially more of a theatre.#We don#t have a lot of room for queuing, so the more work we can do offsite the better to minimise the amount of people who are having to queue.#Obviously that comes with accessibility issues though, as not everyone can access the internet or use a computer but it#s something we are considering.#Another thing we have to consider is how people will be able to get to the toilet in the middle of a film, they will have to go down a row of people.#Sport centre bosses said they were disappointed that no date had yet been set for customers to use their facilities, saying residents were #desperate# to get back into centres, gyms and swimming pools.After taking a “first, cautious step” by allowing elite athletes back on their outdoor track, Aberdeen Sports Village chief executive Duncan Sinclair revealed hopes the whole site can reopen to the public in phase three of Scotland’s lockdown easing.He explained: “I think operators like ASV will be allowed to open in phase three. My speculation for that is late July, maybe early August.“I do think there’s a slight inconsistency in opening up some sectors before others, but the government # the Scottish Government in our case # are trying to get the balance between reopening the economy and keeping citizens safe.“But I think there is a huge volume of evidence to say sports centres and gyms should be opening earlier than perhaps they’re planning to.“There’s a great desire from people to get back and get physically active. People and operators, like ASV, have been innovative with home workouts, but there are a number of surveys now saying people are desperate to get in to sports centres, gyms and swimming pools.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c41ad5666cca3.13933188.jpg ","title":"mcinally favours possible october start for next term","story":"Peterhead manager Jim McInally believes October is a realistic target for starting next season’s League One and Two campaigns.The Scottish Premiership is planning for an August  start to next term with the Championship aiming to begin the new season on October .Although nothing has been agreed yet, League One and Two hope to follow the same path as the second tier, with a -game season starting in October.The hope is, come October, supporters would also be allowed to attend games, although it seems social distancing will still need to be observed.Blue Toon boss McInally said: “October is something realistic to aim for and it makes sense to me.“The next step really is getting a fixture list drawn up because then it gives clubs the chance to sell those fixtures by coming up with season ticket packages, match sponsorship, hospitality and that sort of things.“Refunds will also need to be sorted out for the games that supporters missed out on this season, whether it’s discount on next season’s tickets or money back.“There’s lots to do and lots to sort out, but it’s positive that things are moving forward.“A -game league season will be fine, I know it’s less games but in the time frame it would work well.“I think there’s still the hope that the Betfred Cup, Scottish Cup and Challenge Cup will all be played, so there should be plenty of games.”McInally believes having restart date on the horizon is also good news for Scotland’s players who have been out of action since March.Some are facing uncertain futures when it comes to being kept on by clubs, while those under contracts are trying to keep fit on their own.McInally has seen in it first hand with former Peterhead attacker and son-in-law Ryan Dow, who is now with Dunfermline.He added: “Getting closer to a restart is particularly good for players because it must have been so hard for them.“It’s been more than three months since they played or trained and when that’s what you’re used to it must be dficult to lose it.“I know how hard it is for Ryan, it’s been such a long time for these guys without doing their jobs and it’s hard.“Keeping fit and going out running on their own is no fun, it’s like everyone  with this pandemic, everybody has been affected in their own way.“Football doesn’t deserve to be put on a pedestal in terms of things that have been impacted over the last few months.“The one thing with football is that it’s a community thing, it brings communities together.“For supporters it’s a release or an escape for them and you never know we might find that more supporters come to games and support clubs when we dojust because they’re so grateful to have it back.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 8 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRegular contributor Aileen Gillies sent us this week#s photograph, which she has called #What ewe looking at #."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real.ldquoThe risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.ldquoIt can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage.ldquoAs well as these, the user can become confused and panicky which may lead to accidents.The gas is not illegal and can be bought widely online and is used by dentists and medical professionals to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.The officer stressed it was ldquonot something we want our children and young people experimenting with.A spokesperson for Midlothian and East Lothian Drugs and Alcohol Partnershipsaid: ldquoWe would like to remind the public that laughing gas might sound fun, but the risks are not.ldquoNitrous oxide slows down messages between the brain and body.ldquoNegative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting and dficulty in your ability to breathe.ldquoIt can also cause confusion and clouded judgement.ldquoThis may put you at higher risk of accidents.ldquoIt is best to avoid using nitrous oxide, especiallyyou have an underlying health condition and mixing it with other drugs, particularly alcohol, increases the risk of harm.ldquoAnyone seeking further assistance, support or advice is advised to contact MYPAS who provide a friendly, confidential and nonjudgemental drug and alcohol support for young people in East Lothian and Midlothian.Sharon Saunders, head of communities and partnerships at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe have had reports of the misuse of these canisters from a number of council services including Safer Communities, Countryside Rangers and MELDAP and, as leaders of services for children and young people, we are all concerned that people know of this developing trend and the signicant risks associated with use of these canisters.ldquoUsing these canisters poses signicant health concerns as itrsquos a harmful and potentially lethal substance and itrsquos important that young people and their families are aware of the real and signicant health risks associated with using these canisters.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothianrsquos MP, and Iain Gray, the countyrsquos MSP, backed plans for a multi-agency meeting to tackle the issue.Mr MacAskill said: ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the police and responsible vendors.Mr Gray was similarly keen to see the issue tackled and encouraged anyone with information to contact the police.He said: ldquoThere have been widespread reports of large numbers of these discarded canisters being found in areas across the UK over recent weeks.ldquoThe fact that so many were found in one place here suggests that this is also a problem locally and one that will undoubtedly be of concern to parents.ldquoIrsquom pleased to see that a multiagency response is being pursued to help tackle the issue, and would certainly echo what has been said about parents discussing the potential risks with their children and reporting any relevant information to the police.Ch Insp Mitchell urged parents, writing in his Courier column: ldquoPlease do all you can to talk to your children, discuss the dangers of these canisters and of the impact of anti-social behaviour.ldquoEventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has been and please

He also contributed music features to The Herald, was a presenter with the BBC, wrote for the Edinburgh Evening News, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, and also worked at the radio station, Scot FM, in the s.Between  and , he was a member of this papers reviewing team at the Edinburgh Festivals, covering Fringe comedy with a keen eye for new talent as well as incisive criticism of established acts, and making recommendations for the Herald Angel awards. In the fetid atmosphere of the capital in August, he took a delight in not being swayed by publicity hype, and recognising acts with the promise of a sustained career.Colin Somerville was born in Comrie, Perthshire, in October , to William and Jacqueline, who ran a local hair salon. He was educated at Christrsquos Hospital in Horsham, West Sussex , and from a young age he decided to become a journalist. He was writing concert reviews for an Edinburgh newspaper at  and, like hundreds of hopefuls before and since, went to study journalism, at Napier College, in Edinburgh.In  he started working as a trainee news reporter at Radio Forth. At one point he was invited to take over a local music show, which he eventually made his own. The music coverage was steadily expanded one of the new shows, Forth Street, was originally presented by Somerville with Muriel Gray. He also become the stationrsquos music controller.He interviewed many celebrities during his time at Forth, among them August Darnell, otherwise known as Kid Creole. The pair of them once went into the well-known Edinburgh pub, Matherrsquos, with Darnell resplendent in a full zoot-suit, says Neil Cooper, an arts writer on The Herald.Adds Cooper: ldquoColin was a mighty broadcaster and writer, whose musical antennae was genius. He got me into the Edinburgh Evening News to do theatre reviews in the late s when he was running the arts and entertainments page, and became a mate who got me into more scrapes than I can remember.ldquoHe was wonderfully deadpan, witheringly cynical and glorious company, with a story about anyone and everyone. He taught me a ton. Listening to war stories of Edinburghrsquos music scene in the s, or  ear-wigging in on him doing a phone interview with someone, was an education.For the Herald Somerville wrote album reviews and music features, his knowledge and his passion on full display, and he also reviewed comedy shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.David Belcher, formerly a rock and pop music writer on the Herald, says: ldquoHe was enormously knowledgeable about music and comedy, and about most things. He was very wise and enthusiastic, and great fun to be around. He recalls going to Moscow for a weekend on a promotional trip, along with Somerville and a planeload of other journalists, to see the Scottish band, Big Country.ldquoI would meet him periodically at ious events, and he was the calm man at the centre of any storm that might be going on, for example when you were trying to get your name on a guest-list or retrieve your guest-list tickets.Somerville, who had a golden retriever named Iggy, after the colourful rock singer, Iggy Pop, was an enthusiastic reader of such writers as Hunter S. Thompson, Iain Banks and Ian Rankin he loved cooking but was ldquorubbish at DIY, says his son, Joe, who adds, ldquoHe was very interested in people and their stories. He passed on his love of sport to Joersquos brother, Jake, and his love of music and comedy to Joe and his sister, Rachel. Before his untimely death he was able to meet his granddaughter, Norah, who is now  months.Colin, who was twice married, contracted early-onset dementia several years ago, was being cared for at Manor Grange Care Home, Edinburgh. Recently it was reported that Fe College is planning to create a scholarship for new and emerging radio talent in his memory.Dougi McMillan, director of the Faculty of Creative Industries at the college, described Colin as ldquovery well respected, knowledgeable and connected throughout broadcasting, publishing ...the radio students and his colleagues alike adored him, all his le stories, anecdotes and laughter."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-strive-ensure-new-normal-entails-fairer-safer-society","story":"ldquoNormal is most certainly not a state to which so many in our society and globally, for instance the children in pre-pandemic poverty and their families, would wish to .What the ldquonew normal will be for them depends on us, the privileged ones.

This involves welfare, becoming a statistic for the first time, trusting and hoping the place of last resort, that of social security, will be there in the hour of need.Applying for welfare is a very daunting experience and for many it is alien, because for most who join the workforce, there is no need to familiarise oneself with the ins and outs of the welfare system, that is for others. So this will be a whole new chapter and one that will be daunting.The current system of welfare involves applying for Universal Credit and your article highlighting the research by Bath and Oxford Universitiescertainly exposed the downfalls of this system. It pointed to an unfair and thoughtless system of payments, and ndash confirming what opposition MPrsquos have been telling the Government for years ndash the view that Universal Credit should be reviewed, even replaced, with immediate effect. Perhaps two million new applications for Universal Credit, consequences of Covid-, will once and for all expose the shortfalls of this system to a Government at Westminster who must tackle this sector of the economy going forward.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-whole-truth-potatoes","story":"May I offer a solution Mr Gowie  Stop peeling your tatties, I have not peeled a potato, whether for boiling, baking, mashing, frying or soup, for more years than I can remember.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week.

Flagging up the statement Nicola Sturgeon made yesterday, the PM gazed into his crystal ball and predicted it would be ldquouncannily similar to the one that Irsquove just given.He was right, to some extent. The beer gardens of Scotland shall, like those in England, open. Hairdressers will snip, friends and family will meet indoors, cinemas will screen films. While the FM did not go as far as Mr Johnson in lting the two metre rule, that looks likely to follow next week. Between this and the U-turn on schools, the pace of change is positively dizzying. It is like going on an extended ride on the waltzers.:PM takes a swipe at Sturgeon for uncannily similar briefingsEngland, under Mr Johnsonrsquos plan, will go further and faster. If anyone doubts how nakedly populist the PM is being, just take a look at the date for the easing of lockdown to begin ndash July , Independence Day in the US. When it comes to Scotland, independence remains a four letter word. Otherwise, Downing Street is delighted to celebrate the concept.But here we are, getting ahead of ourselves. As the Prime Minister made clear, the virus is still out there, andit becomes clear that there is a surge in new cases lockdown restrictions could be reimposed.Really, Mr Johnson, who do you think you are kidding  Now that people are only too aware of how miserable le in lockdown can be, it would take a brave and uniquely gted premier to persuade the public back into that jail cell, and we know Mr Johnson is neither.He is acting quickly because of the economic catastrophe we, and the rest of the world, are facing. And to please his own backbenchers and party backers, of course. One might have a sneaking admiration for himhe came straight out and admitted to the latter, instead of trying to convince us that he is acting according to a well-thought out plan. If the strategy was that oven-ready, businesses in England would not have been hammering on Downing Streetrsquos door on Tuesday seeking clarication.As the PM spoke at what was to be the last daily briefing, Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientic adviser, displayed obvious caution. When it came to the relaxation of the two metre rule they did not so much socially distance themselves from Mr Johnson as figuratively pick up their podiums and move to a neighbouring county. Professor Whittyrsquos assessment was frank. ldquoIf people donrsquot take the mitigation seriously,people hear a distorted version of whatrsquos being said that says lsquoThis is all fine, itrsquos gone away,rsquo yes we will get an uptick ndash for sure.He is not the only one concerned. A letter to the British Medical Journal, signed by the leaders of all the major medical and nursing bodies, warned that ldquothe available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. We know the truth of that already from the experiences of Germany and South Korea, two countries massively more successful than the UK in dealing with the pandemic.The letter urged the UK Government to look at how well prepared the country is for a second wave. That warning must be heeded. Much has been made by Governments across the UK of how they have been dealing with unprecedented and fast-moving events that they could not have seen coming.That was always debatable . As the virus spread from China to mainland Europe it was plain what was needed and what worked. Yet the lockdown came too slowly and the testing strategy was abandoned too quickly. Being unprepared for a second wave will be inexcusable, and that goes for Edinburgh as much as London, Belfast and Cardf.It is fear of a second wave that has been cited as the reason for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos more hesitant approach to easing the lockdown. The FM has indeed played cautious cop to Mr Johnsonrsquos all-over-the-shop cop, the Juliet Bravo to his Jack Regan of The Sweeney.Both have made mistakes. There has been too much hiding behind the skirts of science instead of taking the lead. Too many pronouncements made from podiums instead of finding out what it has really been like living in lockdown.:Guy Stenhouse:  Comparing Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon is an interesting exerciseThat is why there was such anger over the travels of Catherine Calderwood and Dominic Cummings. It is also why the policy of blended learning was never going to survive contact with reality.From the start of this crisis people have wanted to be treated like grown ups. Edinburgh and London are finally catching up with that. There needs to be more straight talking about the risks and dangers that lie ahead. Key to charting a way through them, and getting ahead of a second wave, is a fully ing system to test, track and isolate. Let us not take our eye off that prize.Mr Johnson has more need for candour than the First Minister. Of the two, she has been the more forthright and credible. As such, only the wilder elements in her party would even think of calling for her to gothere is a second wave that could have been prevented.You can bet your last mask, however, that should the worst happen in England the Conservatives will dump Mr Johnson. They have never really warmed to him and they certainly do not trust him. He was sufficiently appealing to a large enough swathe of the electorate in England to win a General Election and save their seats, and that was what mattered to them.Then the virus arrived and showed that they had been right all along about his weaknesses. He was lazy, ill-prepared, and indecisive. A follower when a leader was needed.If there is one thing on which all sides can agree is that in time there must be an inquiry into the handling of this crisis.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff.

Current evidence supports the two-metre guidance in many locations, occupations and industries because of airborne as well as large droplet transmission. Past research underestimates viral airborne risks. Evidence from clusters supports more caution. The R rate is still not low enough across the UK for change but it is as low as it is partly because of the two-metre distancing.There is also still limited evidence to support a reduction below two metres and the latest WHO-funded study on one and two metres is not conclusive and has been attacked as inadequate. Yet even that acknowledges two metres is more protective than one.Current evidence supports the general importance of the combined use of social distancing, use of masks and other PPE and handwashing, not removing or reducing parts of this strategy. There must also be continued employment, wage protection and suspension of punitive sickness absence and performance management system, to encourage safe practices including self-isolation.We have not yet seen the review that the Prime Minister apparently used to make his decision.

We think the memorial garden will be enough of a distinctive attraction that people will stop in the town centre as well.Born in June , Glover spent the first six years of his le in Fraserburgh, at that time a rapidly expanding fishing and trading port.Upon leaving school in , he took a job as a shipping clerk with the Jardine Matheson trading company, later joining its Far Eastern operation and accepting a posting to Shanghai.There he sold opium to middlemen and traded in silks, tea and guns before relocating to Nagasaki as the old order disintegrated.He was a key figure in the Mitsubishi conglomeratersquos early growth, building links with Scottish shipyards and playing an instrumental role in bringing students to universities north of the Border.Echoing his achievements, proposals for the Fraserburgh memorial envisage a courtyard garden which will double as a community and interpretation space offering information about Gloverrsquos role in the creation of modern Japan.A monument and pine tree inspired by his famous Nagasaki garden, which he named ldquoIpponmatsua , are also planned, while low, evergreen ground-cover will reference the ldquomossy mounds characteristic of traditional Japanese horticulture.The memorial, designed with the help of RankinFraser Landscape Architects, is one of a range of projects being taken forward as part of a pound. million investment in the new Fraserburgh Central Conservation Area over a five-year period to March .ldquoThe wider regeneration project is very signicant because Fraserburgh, certainly over a long period, had become quite run down, said Ms Simpson.ldquoWhat we still have of Glover is the place he knew as a child and there are a great many buildings in the town that were part of the place when he lived there.ldquoWe are using modern conservation principles to make it quite clear where design is fresh and modern.

Home learning has been disastrous with some teachers reporting only a handful of children turning up for online lessons. Many other parents worried schools might not be safe enough for .Teachers busied themselves getting their classrooms ready for social distancing. Head teachers devised complicated timetables which would see groups of children in school on alternate days or weeks, or dfering times of the day.However, the SNP came under pressure over this worrisome and confusing policy. Angry parents and opposition MSPs made le dficult for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government. As a result, on Tuesday, the policy changed.Now the plan is for schools to reopen full-time in August without social distancing. Why  Whatrsquos changed  Apparently, according to Swinney, when it comes to the pandemic, ldquothe picture looks more positive.Forgive me,I donrsquot believe this. Only a fool would think that this country ndash along with many other nations which have handled coronavirus much more successfully ndash isnrsquot heading for a second wave. Surgeons, nurses and GPs all fear a second wave.Countries which have eased lockdown are experiencing spikes and clusters. France recorded  new cases of coronavirus in  hours and is investigating five new clusters, bringing the total number of clusters in the country to . The country eased out of lockdown, opening bars and restaurants from early June but continues to see hundreds of new daily cases.Italy has recorded  new cases of coronavirus.

Therersquos been more than  deaths here. In the UK, therersquos been more than ,. Scotland has roughly a tenth of the UKrsquos population. The figures speak for themselves.How is this a ldquopositive picture as Swinney claims  Understandably, parents are even more worried now. Before, it seemed that it was just their childrenrsquos education which would suffer. Now, parents worry about ato school without social distancing measures. Theyrsquore also more confused than ever. Swinneyrsquos announcement clashes with much of the information theyrsquore receiving from schools about their childrenrsquos education.Teachers are also worried. Theyrsquore genuinely scared. Theyrsquore being asked to go into their classrooms unsuregovernment guidance is sufficient to protect them. Nobody should be expected to go to work fearful. Teachers also feel used. They worked hard to put the \"blended\" model in place ndash now thatrsquos gone. So, itrsquos little wonder that teachers are angry with the SNP.The SNPrsquos dithering, confused messaging on education appears simply cruel when it comes to teachers, parents and children.But the most repellent aspect of the whole fiasco is the crowing and gloating and politicking by our MSPs and their party apparatchiks. Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class. But then the only lesson to be learned from this entire fiasco is that Scottish politics itself is a failure.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We soon worked out which services were undeliverable at the time or not critical. Our leline services remained, including food provision and keeping our outreach workers on the streets.\": NHS worker spends free time delivering PPE to local care homes and hospitalsAlready working with community groups across central and southern Scotland as a FareShare franchise, distributing good quality surplus food from the hospitality and retail industries, Cyrenians were able to mobilise their staff and volunteers to cook and deliver healthy meals to people experiencing isolation, poverty or homelessness.The Edinburgh depot, with its five full time staff and more than  volunteers, soon became the central hub that was distributing  tonnes of food - or around , meals - every week during lockdown.Mr Hay said: \"No one faltered or stumbled and we moved into food production for people that really needed it.\"Working closely with RBS at their headquarters at Gogarburn, along with Social Bite and the Trussel Trust, meant that the Cyrenians could maximise their output and benefit from the relationships cultivated by the other organisations, streamlining their own operation and offering other goods to iniduals and families in need including books and activity packs donated by the Scottish Book Trust.To continue providing food and support to people affected by homelessness, as well as others living in isolation, Cyrenians are calling for chefs who may be furloughed or out of work to come and assist with their food production operation, as well as any companies who can provide vital sources of protein to their meals.Mr Hay said: \"We know the dference nutrition make on mental and physical health and a core element of that is protein. Without it, deficiencies can occur and with the negative mental cycle of lockdown nobody needs any other reason for low mood, fatigue and malaise.\"The introduction of a new Virtual Community Kitchen will bring back the charitys Community Cook Clubs, although Mr Hay acknowledges that many will miss the \"togetherness and social element\" that defined the clubs before the crisis.But it has been the determination, enthusiasm and hard work of benefactors, staff and volunteers - many of whom has previously accessed Cyrenians services - that has kept everything afloat.Mr Hay said: \"The thanks goes way deeper and wider even than just the people in our organisation. There is an entire network that we are simply the catalyst in ndash without the local community groups to give the food to then everything grinds to a halt as we cannot reach every end recipient of the food - food prepared and delivered with compassion, care and love. I pray that a gain from the pandemic is that communities are more in touch with each other and that solidarity and support prevail.\": Kindness Homeless Street Team help those in need during lockdownldquoBusinesses, customers and colleagues from across Scotland have become involved, offering their time, skills and resource to help during one of the most challenging times in history.

He grew up in Yorkshire and signed for Hull when he was . He might then have stayed on at Hull and had a great career there, but he left, and played in America, then came to Scotland where Kilmarnock wanted him, then went off to Canada and lots of other places and none of it ever felt very comfortable for him and a big part of the reason for that was his sexuality.But now, this week, Thomas has gone public, making him only the second male professional footballer in the UK to reveal hersquos gay. Without doubt, itrsquos an important step for sport and for LGBT equality, but because Thomas retired in , it doesnrsquot actually change the fact that there still isnrsquot a single out gay man playing in the professional game in Britain. There was Justin Fashanu in the s, but thatrsquos it.The fact Thomas has waited until now to talk openly is understandable: when, who, andgay people reveal their sexuality is up to them, but the problem is that the football industry was, and is, unwelcoming for gay men. Watfordrsquos captain Troy Deeney said the other day that every football team is likely to have a gay player. The fact that not a single one of them is public tells you everything you need to know.The problem boils down to three parts: players, management, and the fans, and the pressure they are exerting, possibly unconsciously, on players to stay silent. Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas. That will help ensure all of us stay safe.”The latest advice on this can be found here: https:www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid- coronavirus-covid--physical-distancingcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Schools will rightly need to be focusing on this vital work as theyin the new academic year.ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton also welcomed the move to suspend the assessment.But he added: ldquoThe Government must also undertake a review of Key Stage  tests due to be taken next May, as a matter of urgency.ldquoThere may be merit in allowing schools to run them for their own checks and to support childrenrsquos transition to secondary education. But it would be wrong to use them for school performance tables after so much disruption and as schools focus on helping children catch up.Mr Gibb said the Government ldquoremain committed to introducing the new assessment to have a fairer accountability system for schools, based on the progress pupils make.He confirmed that schools which wish to become early adopters of the assessment can still do so.We welcome governmentrsquos decision to delay introducing #ReceptionBaseline .

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight #

but methinks neither Fred Morrison nor Dr Angus Macdonald need have any fears there either And so with health and safety requirements plus traceability suitably concluded play duly started on Friday th May at am – prompt .Play would necessarily be limited to solo or dyads of players with  minute intervals between groups teeing off in order to maintain social distancing.Apparently there were some horror shots off the first tee and indeed #yours truly# playing that first morning as a #lone-ranger# was mightily relieved to see his opening bf # following an enforced  week lay-off # fly straight and true down the middle of the fairway.That doesn#t happen very often!Social media pictures provided evidence of a rich harvest of players theand breadth of the land sclaffing and indeed in some cases actually missing the ball completely much of course to the great amusement and consequent delight of their respective playing companions and assorted onlookers.With the restrictions on playing golf eased well before local football and with the shinty season already all but over before it has even started the golf club is delighted to see that some of their fellow sports enthusiasts in Skye and Lochalsh have decided to give their #second# game a wee bit more attention pending the resumption of their own particular athletic activity of choice.Many of the shinty and football boys have paid their green fees for a round on the course in the past to both stimulate their interest and improve their golfing skills in God#s own game but now that there#s no choice of sport the membership numbers at the club have started to grow and develop-and all are most welcome.Although it could still be a wee while before the #rubber once again hits the road# and the competitive golf resumes the situation could be much worse.Consider the dilemma facing a much larger Highland club with c. members and the problems associated with trying to accommodate these golfers desperation toto their #links# Teeing off from am till :pm in ten-minute intervals playing either solo or in pairs only c. players per day get the chance to grace their fairways.Whereas down Sconser way our members can now book their slot, play their game, savour the view, enjoy the company then travel but a short distance home only today-after-day should they so desire Stay safe, keep healthy and best wishes to you all from the Isle of Skye Golf Club.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home-farm-new.jpg","title":"skye nursing home worker positive for covid 19 for a second","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe news that a staff member had tested positive for a second time was confirmed by local MP Ian Blackford.Ten residents died at the nursing home after a major outbreak of the virus was detected there at the end of April.The Free Press understands all residents and staff at the home are to be re-tested as a precautionary measure today.The interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith was questioned about re-infection at today#s Scottish Government coronavirus daily briefing.He said that he could not comment on the inidual case, but added that the global evidence was that re-infection is #not a phenomenon we would recognise#.Dr Smith added that viral fragments can still be picked up in tests many weeks after the initial infection, and these highlighted the challenges which surrounds the testing process.Skye councillor John Gordon, whose father died at the home after testing positive for Covid-, said he was concerned families had found out about the new test via social media.He said: #Our thoughts are with families, residents, and staff who yet again have had to read about this on social media which has caused them more distress.#I can’t understand why a protocol has not been put in place to contact families before it’s in the media, and why management is not informing staff, despite assurances from NHS Highland and HC-Onethat this is happening.#Regular precautionary testing should be happening as a matter of course.#It’s a worrying time.#Mr Blackford said: #It has been confirmed to me that one of the staff members at Home Farm who had previously tested positive for Covid-, recovered and was tested negative twice has tested positive again.#The staff member concerned was re-rested on Sunday and received confirmation last night that they were positive.#It is important to stress that when someone does test positive having previously had Covid- that they may not necessarily be infectious.

ready themselves for re-opening in August.They had done so in the expectation that school capacity would be limited, with two metre social distancing rules remaining in place.Many parents has

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

It#s all about reducing the risk as much as possible, he said.With the easing of lockdown you increase your chance of exposure, but the advantage we have in Northern Ireland is that the rate of disease - what we call the prevalence - is low.He was optimistic the contact tracing system would be effective in the event of a second spike, as Northern Ireland was the first UK region to establish a system and had a relatively low number of cases.That#s certainly a crucial measure to make the easing of lockdown as safe as possible, he said.When we look at Germany and see that abattoir town which has had to go back into lockdown, we fully appreciate thata part of Northern Ireland develops a lot of infections the area will have to go into lockdown again.Dr Black added that a daily reporting system from GPs on patients who develop Covid- symptoms meant any localised outbreak should be spotted quickly.Meanwhile, Green Party MLA Rachel Woods accused the Executive of having a scattergun approach to easing lockdown which risked undermining public confidence.There are glaring anomalies between the Executive#s Coronavirus Recovery Plan and what has actually happened, she said. The five stages of the plan haven#t been followed in a linear way and the recovery plan isn#t joined up with. For example, non-essential retail reopened before restrictions on childcare provision have been relaxed.She questioned why reopening had been fast tracked for certain sectors - such as restaurants, cafes and pubs, which were originally set out in step five of the recovery plan - but not for non-contact sport, which was set out in step two.While recognising the Executive was following medical and scientic advice, she questioned why this was not available to the public. This, coupled with the Executive#s approach to reopening, creates the impression that the plan is being rewritten on the hoof, according to which sector can shout the loudest, she added.The lack of supporting, detailed guidance even covering the basics makes it increasingly dficult for those sectors who can reopen to do so with confidence around safety.In an open letter which was published in the British Medical Journal, health leaders from a range of organisations in the UK said an urgent review was needed to prevent more loss of le during the winter months.This follows an announcement from the Prime Minister Boris Johnson that pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers may open from July . The two metre distancing rule is to be replaced by a one-metre plus rule, allowing people to stand one metre apartnecessary.Sir David King, a former chief scientic adviser, told Sky News he believed the latest measures were extraordinarily risky and said he believed that the Prime Minister had acted too quickly.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus masks company ‘should be withdrawn pending investigation’A company which conducted improper tests on masks protecting staff against coronavirus should be withdrawn until investigation is complete, nurses said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandPlans to reopen schools could changenumber of Covid- cases declinesContingency plans to reopen schools in Northern Ireland could changethe number of Covid- cases continues to decline, the Education Minister has said.Most ReadPolice appeal for public to search homes, gardens and unused vehicles for missing Noah Donohoe Unionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA womanNoah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherWe of former NI Secretary of State Owen Paterson found dead at family homeNoah Donohoe mum pleads: I want my son back,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press Eye.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPrices in hairdressers, hotels, cafes and pubs are set to rise in post-lockdown Northern Ireland.Despite promises to keep them at pre-pandemic levels, key industry figures have warned customers of imminent hikes, to reflect increased costs and reduced capacity - and because they will struggle to offer deals across a range of services.Hairdressers said the price of a blow-dry, cut or colour was likely to rise by at least £ as salons offset extra costs.Belfast publican Willie Jack, owner of the famous Duke of York, the Harp Bar and The Dark Horse, said that punters can expect the price of a pint to rise to £, while Botanic Inns boss Stephen Magorrian warned that the cheapest wine on the menu could cost just under £ a bottle.Cafe owner Karen Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion in Londonderry, said cafes may have to raise their prices to offset all the new health and safety costs.And while none of the hoteliers contacted by the Belfastadmitted there would be price hikes, Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation indicated there are challenges ahead.There are additional costs for business: sanitation, new operational procedures and new equipment, she said.There are also issues around reduced capacity which brings into question the viability of some activities. Meanwhile, a number of income streams are effectively cut off as hotels are still unable to stage weddings and spas are restricted.Strict social distancing controls are likely to be reduced soon by the Executive from two metres to one, after Prime Minister Boris Johnston relaxed the rules in England earlier this week.It follows repeated calls from the hard hit hospitality, services and tourism sectors, as the roadmap to reopen the region gathers pace.Northern Ireland#s food-serving pubs, restaurants and hotels are gearing up to reopen on July , while hairdressers will have their scissors at the ready on July .Ken McClure, vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, said most salons would find price hikes unavoidable.Prices will have to go up by around £ per person to offset the additional costs we#ll incur to reopen safely, he told the Belfast .Owners will need to provide personal protection equipment , hand sanitisers, perspex screens and take other safety measures.Mr McClure, who owns Kenneth Michael International Hair and Beauty in east Belfast, said they would have to spread out appointments so that there will be fewer clients at any one time to comply with social distancing rules.There will be a very limited waiting area and we#ll be asking people to come alone, he added.We#ll also have to consider putting up extra pegs for clothes and wash gowns after every use.Colin Neil of Hospitality Ulster said it is hard to predict what effect increased costs and social distancing will have on pricing.He added: Pubs are looking at new business models and trying to work out how they break even.Mr Jack, a renowned publican, said the price of a pint will increase.I can see prices going up because of the cost of security required to keep numbers below a certain capacity, he said.The Duke of York and Harp Bar are both busy non-food, live music venues and I#ll have to operate at somewhere between % and % capacity.A pint might increase from £. to £. That#s also to avoid dealing with change. A glass of wine will probably stay the same price.Any publican who reopens will probably be losing money for the rest of the year.Mr Magorrian, whose bars include the hugely popular Northern Whig, said he was reviewing all prices both to reflect increased costs and for safety reasons.We need to move away from £. and £. and go to £. or £ to cut down on the level of change we#re carrying, he said.The cheapest bottle of wine in the Whig is £., whereas a glass is up by p to £. or £.He added: The major thing we#ll be doing is avoiding deals such as two courses for a set price mid-week, or kids eat free on a Sunday, or cocktail happy hour.Julie Hastings, marketing director at Hastings Hotels, whose portfolio includes The Europa and Grand Central in Belfast city centre, said prices will stay static.Prices at each of our seven properties are being kept very much the same as pre-lockdown to encourage as many bookings as possible, she said.Hospitality chief Michael Stewart, who co-runs House Belfast hotel, bar and restaurant, said it#s inevitable that a lot of venues will have to increase prices to sustain the costs they incur.He added: For hotels it#s a moving feast so nobody knows. If the Chancellor reduces VAT in the next budget it will give us room for manoeuvre on prices. Ms Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion, said that price hikes are likely, although she pledged: I won#t be putting up mine.She added: Others may have no option but to increase their prices given all the extra costs incurred in complying with the new safety rules.

There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post.

It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. Business Lenders like Danske Bank in Northern Ireland have been working with the UK Government to provide vital financial support to companies experiencing lost or deferred revenue as a result of the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push They have appointed a dedicated head of business sector engagement to lead proactive engagement with businesses, raising awareness of the support available. Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

On June , St Columbs College and Thornhill College announced they wouldnot use academic criteria for admissions to Year  in . Both St Columbs and Thornhill have used the GL Entrance Assessment results to select pupils since the old + exam was abolished in . However, in a joint letter to the parents, s and carers of children in Primary  published earlier this month, the schools announced pupils applying for September  will not have to sit the exam due to the educational disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Derrys two co-educational grammar schools, Lumen Christi College and Foyle College, are yet to confirmthey will require their  intake to sit atransfertest. The Derry News contacted both schools on thematter, but they declined to comment. Last week, two Northern Irish parents won High Court permission to challenge the decision to delay this year’s post-primary transfer tests by two weeks. Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan, who is the partyseducation spokesperson, asked schools to take the views of parents and educational specialists onboard when making a decision on the tests. While the purpose of this particular challenge is to delay these unfair and unregulatedtests, it will add to the growing public debate around academic selection. googletag.cmd.push This year, as a result of the COVID- pandemic, many schools have already taken the decision to suspend the use of academic selectiontestsand there are growing calls for it to be abandoned altogether. I would appeal to schools still intent on using academic selection to listen to the views of an increasing number of educationalists, trade unions and parents and endtransfertestsonce and for all.

Baby Michael MacHugh shocked his mum Sara and dad Conall in January of this year by arriving  weeks early. His parents were told that he had a % chance of survival. Michael ended up having to spend  weeks in hospital. During this time, Tinyle, a charity which supports families of premature babies, was a vital help to Sara and Conall. Michael is now at home and doing well but his family were keen to raise money for Tinyle. googletag.cmd.push Michael’s uncle Caolan , his dads identical twin, agreed to shave off his fair to support the charity.  Caolans friend, Owen Brady, also agreed to so the same thing, and, between them, the two men have managed to raise more than pound, for the charity. Michaels mum said it had been dficult time for their family. “Michael was born on th January  at  weeks + days gestation,  weeks early, weighing just lb oz. “He is now over lb at  weeks old. “His due date was th of April . Michael was born in Altnagelvin at .am and transferred to The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at pm that same day. googletag.cmd.push “He spent five and a half weeks in the Royal where he received four of his five blood transfusions and spent the last seven and a half weeks back in Altnagelvin, where he got his last blood transfusion. “During this hospital stay I was also told that a baby born at  weeks has a % survival rate, defying all the odds Michael is with us now, thankfully a happy healthy  week old. “He is smaller than other babies his age and developmentally has some catching up to do but he is a little fighter.” Sara said Tinyle had been a great support to them. “During our stay in hospital TinyLe were a huge support and continue to be there for us, by way of thanks we wanted to raise funds for the charity and so lockdown presented the perfect opportunity. “As lockdown has rolled on Michael’s uncle Caolan, his dads identical twin became increasingly in need of a visit to the barbers, we used this to our advantage and challenged Caolan to a head shave. “Caolan’s friend Owen Brady also braved the shave,” she added. “Our family and friends rallied their support and I’m delighted to say we have raised over pound, for for TinyLe.” Valerie Cromie, Head of Fundraising for TinyLe , said the funds raised would be put to good use. “We are greatly indebted to the MacHugh family for their generosity and to Caolan and Owen who were brave enough to take on the head shave challenge. “Funds raised will ensure families who experience the birth of a premature baby receive the practical and emotional support they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

Castledawson man Joe O’Kane posted a photograph online last week revealing a message his son had discovered while working on his aunt’s house in the Ballymena area. The message, decoratively presented in a sketched scroll, read: “Papered by Jack Kerr, King St Magherafelt. Painted by Joe Hughes of Moneyglass. The message also states that the named final member of the decorating crew done sweet f**k all! Jack Kerr was a painter who lived in King Street in the town and worked at the time for Seamus Keenan of Castledawson. He also ran a shop for a period on the street where he lived. googletag.cmd.push  Jack Kerrs shop on King St in Magherafelt. His brother, Dermot, said the practice of leaving a message was common. “That was a favourite thing to do down the years,” he told the County Derry Post. “I mind working in the Rectory in Magherafelt when I was at the painting too away in ’. Reverend McGonagle was coming in. “I came on a boy’s name from Aghagaskin, Surgenor I think it was, and it was written way before the turn of the century.” The practice led to Dermot making a remarkable discovery of coincidence as he peeled back some wallpaper in the late s. googletag.cmd.push “I was working on a job near the Loup – they were doing repairs and I was doing the painting for it. I started digging off the wallpaper in the hall of this farmhouse,” he said. “It was big, respectable farmhouse, about  acres. I wasn’t there an hour until I came across names on the ceiling, under the ceiling paper. “It was my father’s name. I was doing the job on Monday, May  in  and I came on my father’s name from May , .” Jack Kerr, second from the right in this  ODonovan Rossa Old Crocks team. The Kerrs were also a musical family, with one particular instrument appealing to the brothers. “Jack played the trumpet and saxophone and his brother Desmond played the saxophone and clarinet. Another brother, Albert, in Castledawson, played the saxophone too,” said Dermot. “Jack played in the Northern Swing Orchestra and they were always on that pantomime in the town, but it stopped in  when Fr Owen died. “I started with the brass band when I was  in the town, an independent brass band, but then I started to play football and forgot about the brass band.” Dermot Kerr was also able to shed some light on the identity of his brother’s colleagues and said Leslie Hepburn did a little more than the pencilled message suggests. Joe Hughes was originally from Moneyglass but now lives in Dunloy, County Antrim, and told us about the process of leaving their mark. “You went in and stripped the wall and before you papered it, you put a scroll on it and wrote the names on it,” he said. “I would have worked with Jack at the time, but It was Seamus Keenan we worked for and that was our trademark when we were in doing them up. It’s many a house you would see that on!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting. I’m humbled and honoured.” Rev McAteer, whose father was a Canon of Chester Cathedral, evoked the words of the Ordination Service. “Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us ‘the needful gts of grace’ to fulfil that ministry. I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn. St Columb’s Cathedral, which was completed in , was the first Anglican cathedral built in the British Isles after the Reformation in .

Void Gallery is ‘delighted’ to announce artists Alan Phelan and David Beattie as the recipients of the Plinth Commissions for  and . The Walker Memorial Plinth was built in  - a  metre high column topped by a five metre high statue of the Reverend George Walker who was Governor of the city during the siege of Derry in . The column and statue were blown up by the IRA in . googletag.cmd.push The remaining plinth and its historical signicance have meant it has been a contentious space in the city. Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Plinth Commissions is a collaboration between Void Gallery, The Siege Museum and Friends of the Derry Walls. The ambition of the commission is to reclaim the space as a public area for collaboration and collective participation. Through an open call, artists both North and South of the border were invited to propose a project involving the community that surrounds the Plinth, creating sculptural interventions as part of the collaboration. The first commission by Dublin-based artist Alan Phelan will launch in September . googletag.cmd.push Phelan’s project is a crowd-sourced sculpture made by inidual participants in isolation, then assembled together to create the final artwork. This collective making process acknowledges and commemorates the COVID- crisis. The sculpture will be of a hyacinth flower using the red, green and blue colours with petals made in papier-macirccheacute, based around a small similar work due to be exhibited at Void Gallery as part of Phelan’s exhibition ‘echoes are always more muted’ which launches at the same time. Alan Phelan commented: “I am delighted to be part of the Plinth Commissions for . “My idea is to work with the community to mark this strange time we have all experienced and harness the people power of socially distanced activity to make this public sculpture. “I look forward to working with Void Engage and bringing people together by staying apart, as they say, for this project.” Launching in , David Beattie proposes a project that will unfold as an invitation to the community to collectively examine the River Foyle as an interconnecting body of water, a richness of bioersity, and a measure of perpetual time. Participants will be invited to connect with the river through a series of engagements that record their experiences and allow them to rethink their relationship with the river and their natural environments. The project will culminate in a sound recording that will be played from the Plinth and will mark the high and low tide of the river, bringing awareness of the rhythm of the river, and movement of time to people within the city. David Beattie, who is also from Dublin, said he was delighted to be selected for this unique commission. “It feels extra special to be supported to produce new artwork during a precarious time for artists and art workers. “I look forward to working alongside the team at Void and the communities on both sides of the River Foyle to realise the project for the Walker Plinth.” Void Director Mary Cremin added: “We are very excited about this public art programme that we have been developing in partnership with The Siege Museum and the Friends of the Derry Walls. “It is a signicant moment to have this plinth reclaimed as a public space when you consider how contentious public monuments and memorials are in this current moment in time,” added Ms Cremin.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

While I missed my family and friends and others who have played a signicant part in my le, I am glad that they could watch from afar via the live-stream.The service began with a welcome and call to worship by the Moderator of Down Presbytery, Rev Dario Leal, minister of First Ballynahinch Presbyterian.During the service, which included three pre-recorded items of worship by members Second Saintfield, Brian McKee a representative elder to the Presbytery from First Ballynahinch, read from  Timothy :-.The sermon, based on the reading from First Timothy, was delivered by the Rev David Hyndman, minister of Magherahamlet and Spa Presbyterian Churches, who convened the Second Saintfield vacancy.Those present for the service and others watching online from over  separate locations also heard short pre-recorded speeches after the service had concluded.One was a message of welcome from Stanley McFarland, Clerk of Session of Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church.The Presbytery Moderator described the installation and ordination service as ldquodferent, but a special evening.He added: ldquoJohn received and accepted a call from Second Saintfield on the Monday before lockdown. While it was frustrating for all concerned that his ordination and installation could not take place in Saintfield due to the restrictions in place, we were delighted and relieved when the offer came from the PCIrsquos General Secretary inviting us to use Assembly Buildings.ldquoIt now means that John can commence his ministry for which he trained and has been called to.

square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

therefore signalling owners of self-contained accommodation should use the next three weeks to prepare to re-open, working with their local communities.ldquoBut I want people to know coronavirus has not gone away.ldquoWe have some headroom to make this package of changes to the regulations, which will be introduced in a phased and cautious way in Wales.ldquoMany aspects of daily le in Wales will be moving into the amber zone in our traffic light system.ldquo But we all need to continue to take steps to protect ourselves from the virus ndash that means working from home wherever possible avoiding unnecessary travel only meeting with one other household outdoors maintaining social distancing and washing your hands often.ldquoIt may also mean wearing a face covering in some situations.ldquoIt is thanks to the efforts of everyone in Wales that we have slowed the spread of coronavirus, but we canrsquot stop now.ldquoWe need to do all we can to protect ourselves and our

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Schools will rightly need to be focusing on this vital work as theyin the new academic year.ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton also welcomed the move to suspend the assessment.But he added: ldquoThe Government must also undertake a review of Key Stage  tests due to be taken next May, as a matter of urgency.ldquoThere may be merit in allowing schools to run them for their own checks and to support childrenrsquos transition to secondary education.

Despite the fact she admits she hated running, she decided to undertake a huge challenge when the lockdown started – km in  days.The -year-old wanted to do something to motivate herself, improve her emotional wellbeing and remind people that the service centre was still there for children even during the lockdown. Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

meeting by Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage and was seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.It read: “That this Council supports, where possible, our local producers and businesses within the procurement process of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.“This will complement the current ‘SHOP LOCAL’ initiativesupported by Council and will provide much needed investment to the Council’s area.“We would ask that a report on this matter is brought forward urgently with a view to supporting our local economy.”Addressing the chamber, the Deputy Lord Mayor said as a local farmer he understands the important social and environmental responsibilitiescouncil has.“We as a Council have a responsibility to our producers and our local businesses in our Council area,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage.“I believe that we have a duty of care to our producers in ensuring that they get a fair share of the profit throughout the food chain.“We also need full traceability on all foods that is used within Council property and at Council events and consideration must be given to the environmental impact caused by food miles.”He also called on Council to adopt the shop local initiativeand look at how Council’s procurement regulations can be adapted to help support local food producers and businesses.“Cost is always an issue but we as a Council have to take our environmental responsibilities into account,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor.“For example, this council is currently buying flowers from outside Northern Irelandbut we have a number of large nurseries within our own borough.“We should also bear in mind that that transport and energy costs are major contributesto green house gas emissions.“We need to look at the wording of framework for contracts and to be more proactive in encouraging local companies to apply for contracts.“As a farmer, I can see first hand the pressure that is facing our industry with the AgricultureBill andthe prospectof food imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone beef which are illegal to produce in Northern Ireland.”The motion was adopted by the Chamber and a report on the issues will be brought
