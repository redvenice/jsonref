Photograph: iStockPricewatch has been talking about pensions for almost as long as it takes to qualify for one but it is rare that we have ever started any class of pension-related conversation with good news. Most of the time we bang on about time bombs and deficits and we alarm people by telling them how they have most likely missed the boat heading towards future financial security.But not this week.That is because the Government announced details of a new auto-enrolment pension scheme which should, if all goes to plan, save many people from living out their golden years in penury and wishing they had listened to that Pricewatch fella back when they were young and sprightly.We have been waiting a long time for such a scheme as the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys admitted last week when unveiling the details of a plan which will see around 750,000 private sector workers, over the age of 23 and under the age of 60 who earn more than €20,000 per year automatically enrolled in a pension scheme if they are not already signed up to an occupational pension scheme.Workers and their employers will both contribute 1.5 per cent of the employees salary to the pension pot while the Government will add an additional €1 for every €3 invested by the worker. The money will be invested until the employee reaches retirement age.Contributions will climb gradually and annually over the first 10 years of the scheme from matching 1.5 per cent of gross salary payments in the first three years, to 3 per cent in year four, 4.5 per cent from year seven and hitting 6 per cent in year 10.People who are automatically signed up to the scheme will be able to walk away from it during a two-month window after six months, although they will only get back their own contributions and not their employer’s or the Government’s share and then, after two years, they will automatically be re-enrolled.“This represents a significant milestone in implementing one of our key Programme for Government commitments. Every worker will have access to a workplace pension,” Humphreys said, adding that it would change a system that has previously left workers “to their own devices to navigate what is a complex world of pensions, to one in which choices and options are simplified on their behalf”.Fees cappedA central processing authority will be established to oversee the scheme and the money in the pension funds will be invested by four registered providers in four different investment portfolios of varying levels of risk. Management fees will be capped at a “maximum envisaged” level of 0.5 per cent of assets under management.The pension savings will transfer with a worker if they switch jobs, so employees will not have to move their pension across to a new scheme.While anything that gets more people to start investing in a pension earlier with the added bonus of a Government contribution might seem like a great idea, there was some disquiet expressed by some in the industry last week.Moyagh Murdock, the chief executive of Insurance Ireland, seemed downbeat in her hot take. “The Irish pensions landscape is already extremely complicated with multiple and often overlapping products and rules and there is a risk that auto enrolment will add to this,” she said as she called for the current pension structure to be simplified.Brokers Ireland didn’t get the bunting out either. While its director of financial services, Rachel McGovern, said she agreed “in principle with the introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme”, she warned that the timing was “likely to be difficult for iniduals affected by the current increased cost of living. Employers are also likely to be concerned about the timing of the introduction of auto enrolment with some still ‘on their knees’ from the events of the last two years.”She also expressed disappointment with “key aspects of the proposals” and said that “with a limit of 0.5 per cent on administrative, management and investment charges, it will not facilitate independent advice for consumers”, and she questioned the need for a centralised processing authority. “This will have to be funded from somewhere. Is that somewhere contributor savings or is it going to be funded elsewhere? There is also a risk that it could become another Irish Water’,” she warned.Ray McKenna of employee benefits advisers Lockton was more optimistic. He described it as “a very welcome announcement that is long overdue for the one-third of employees that currently have no supplementary income outside of the State pension”.He did, however, warn that there’s still a lot of work to be done to ensure scheme goes live in 2024. “Critically, the Government will need to press the go-live button when it’s ready, and we would be concerned that, just like other pension decisions such as increasing the retirement age, there may be a reluctance to act.”And we can’t really afford a reluctance to act any more.Pensions – the basicsLet’s start with the most basic question. What is the retirement age in Ireland? You’d think that was basic wouldn’t you, but it’s not. Many employees retire from their jobs at 65 but the State pension doesn’t kick in until people turn 66 and there are plans to push that out, although we don’t know when that might happen. It was due to happen last year but became something of a political hot potato and was quickly dropped. We should know more about the plans for retirement in the future later this month.But I thought retirement at 65 was set in stone for good reasons?The reasons are more arbitrary than good, to be honest. The age of 65 was first set by German chancellor Otto Von Bismarck in the 1860s.And why did he pick 65?Well, he wanted to ease social unrest by showing himself to be socially progressive – not a common feature of European leaders in the 19th century. But the canny German didn’t want to pay too much for pensions, and with the average German living fewer than 65 years he was pretty sure most of his citizens would never get their hands on his socially progressive pension. But life expectancy – at least in the wealthy West, has increased dramatically over the past 150 years. Today Irish women can reasonably expect to live beyond 84 while – all things being equal – men will live until they hit 80. That is a lot of years of retirement income.It is great news but it does pose a problem. Right now there are around five workers paying tax and PRSI for every retiree, but by the time we get to 2050 that figure is expected to be two workers per retiree. That is going to place a large burden on those two workers and on the State’s coffers in the years ahead.So that is where my private pension comes in, right?Right. That is why the auto-enrolment scheme is so important. If the State pension won’t keep us going we will need our own money too, but half of us don’t have any class of private pension.How much will I need in my pension fund when the time comes? The average size of a private pension in Ireland is about €5,400 a year. Add that to the maximum State pension of €12,900 and you will have a retirement income of €18,400 per year or €1,533 per month. You are probably best placed to decide if that will be enough to allow you to live in the manner to which you have become accustomed. The basic rule of thumb is that an “adequate” gross retirement income is about 50 per cent of gross pre-retirement income. So if you earn €80,000 on the day you retire, you need a pension income of €40,000. If you are one of the lucky ones who gets the maximum State pension of €12,900 then you will need about €27,000. To get to that magic number, you would need a fund of between €700,000 and €950,000.And how much will I need to save to get that? That really depends on how old you are and how much you can save. if you want a private pension pot of around €20,000 per year and you start saving at 25, you will need to put aside around €300 gross per month. With tax relief at the top rate, it actually costs you only €164. If you start at 35, then you need to save around €500 a month before tax, while if you start at 45 then the monthly gross savings come in at close to a grand. Adding the 20 grand to the state pension will give you a pension of close to €33,000.You mentioned tax relief is that still on the table?It absolutely is. Saving for a pension actually gives you a triple bounce when it comes to tax. You can get a tax break on contributions, on investment growth and 25 per cent tax-free at retirement. On contributions, you can receive up to 40 per cent income tax relief (after USC and PRSI are paid) if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. Deposits in banks, credit unions and the rest charge Dirt at 33 per cent while investment growth of the fund over 30-40 years or more is tax-free and compound interest also performs its magic. And for defined-contribution pension savers based on your own savings, employer contributions (if they contribute) and stock-market returns, at retirement age you are entitled to take 25 per cent of your fund tax-free.And what are the returns on a pension?That depends on where you invest your money and when you cash it in, but over the past 30 years the average actively managed pension fund has returned around 8 per cent per year. If you had saved €250 per month over this 36-year period, your total savings would have been €107,750 and your total pot would have been €627,665 after charges, or almost six times your money back.What about pension charges?Charges occur at various stages: when a pension plan is set up, during the contribution phase and when a member exits from a plan. The charges can be borne by either the employer or the member. Anyone making a pension move or decision should consider the effect of charges. If they are too high, they can really eat into your pension pot.What about topping up my pension?Additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) are useful for those behind in their retirement savings or uncertain about the future value of their final-salary pension scheme, and will grow your pension pot quickly. Even if you can only afford 50 quid a month, it will add up over time.A financial adviser’s viewLaura Doyle is the managing director of Progressive Financial Services in Dublin and has been preaching about pensions for years now. She is as good a poster-child for investing in your future as it is possible to get, and it is hard to argue with her when she crunches the numbers.When asked what difference it makes to the size of a pension pot if someone starts putting money aside in the mid-20s compare to their mid 40s, she breaks it down in stark terms.”Based on a salary of €40,000, it would only cost €100 per month to save €2,000 per annum when you factor in the tax relief. If a person pays in from age 25, they’ll have around €60,000 in the pot come their mid-40s if they continue paying at the same rate, by age 70 there’d be €250,000 in the pot.“Whereas the person who started paying the same amount from age 45 would only have around €87,000 by age 70. So those extra 20 years of paying in €100 per month only cost the person €24,000 – €100 x 12 months x 20 years – but increased their pot size by €163,000.”When asked what she thinks are the main obstacles to people – particularly young people – starting a pension, she points to two main barriers. “People’s perception of pensions, and bad marketing. Pensions are over-complicated and people – young and old – through no fault of their own, don’t understand the value of them.“Over the past five years I’ve seen an increase in demand for investing – there’s a big appetite for trading platforms like eToro and Degiro, so why not the same for pensions? You can invest your pension in all the same shares or ETFs, but with one massive advantage – tax relief. It’s essentially free money, and by not paying into a pension you’re missing out on it.”She does have sympathy for someone in their 20s who just can’t get their head around the need to plan for life in their 70s. “Planning for the short to medium term can seem impossible at that age, let alone 40+ years down the tracks. However, I would position paying into a pension at that age for the sole benefit of tax relief. And the power of compound interest cannot be understated: even paying a nominal amount, €10 per week, would make a massive difference when it comes to proper retirement planning in late 30s or early 40s.”If her number crunching doesn’t convince people, what else would she say to someone to try to persuade them to start a pension?Flexibility“Honestly, I just have conversations with people and show them the value of paying into a pension, and what they’re missing out on by not paying into one. Almost everyone will proceed at some level – affordability is always an important factor, but with the minimum contribution starting at €10 per week and the flexibility of being able to increasedecrease or stopstart your contributions, there’s an option for everyone no matter what their circumstances.”She is not entirely convinced the auto-enrolment scheme will be the game-changer some are hoping it will be. “I don’t necessarily think it will appeal to them, they might just see it as another deduction and less take-home pay if it isn’t rolled out properly,” she says. “I think we underestimate the younger generation and have to give them more credit on their ability to make decisions for their future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash

avoid token women new sas drama story mainly men","story":"The BBC’s new SAS drama avoided the anachronistic casting of women because the story of the special forces unit is “mainly about men”, its producer has said.“SAS: Rogue Heroes” is an upcoming BBC One mini-series about the formation of the unit in the Second World War, and the show’s male-dominated cast, including Dominic West and Jack O’Connell, was chosen with historical accuracy in mind.The independent producer behind “SAS: Rogue Heroes” has said the story of the early SAS is “about men” and had to be cast appropriately, in comments which come after criticism of the BBC over historical inaccuracies in its dramas.Martin Haines, managing director of production company Kudos, said: “There is no getting away from it, it is a story mainly about men.“We were… clear, and the BBC recognised, that it wasn’t something where you could pretend that it wasn’t the case, so we sort of lent into it and celebrated it.”He said that the series’ writer, “Peaky Blinders” creator Steven Knight, was also “clear” that the SAS’s beginnings in a male-dominated warzone in North Africa should be accurately depicted on screen.Mr Haines’ comments on the decision to stick with a mainly male cast come after recurring criticism of the BBC over historical accuracy in its dramas.A 2019 BBC One adaptation of “The War of the Worlds” drew criticism for promoting a minor female character from the original HG Wells novel into the heroine of the piece, and viewers also questioned the broadcaster decision to give Victorian clerk Bob Cratchit a mixed-raced family in a 2020 version of “A Christmas Carol”.The BBC’s recent Second World War drama “World on Fire” was also criticised for being too “woke” by having a cast of characters more erse than was likely in the 1940s.Mr Haines has said that “SAS: Rogue Heroes” will reflect the lives of the early SAS servicemen, who he described on the C21 Media podcast as “tough, often very violent, men”.While the cast of the new drama is largely male, a female character played by Algerian actress Sofia Boutella has been created as a “counterpoint” to the show’s leading men.But Mr Haines said the character, a spy called Eve, is a “combination of real-life women who played pivotal roles in the espionage and security services in North Africa”.“SAS: Rogue Heroes” follows the foundation and early days of the SAS under Lieutenant-Colonel Sir David Stirling, who devised the unit in 1941 as a force that would operate behind enemy lines in North Africa, and his successor as SAS commander, Paddy Mayne.A trailer released by the BBC on Sunday shows “Sex Education” star Connor Swindells as Stirling and O’Connell as Mayne, with the pair acting in action-packed scenes filmed on location in Morocco after rigorous training to prepare for the shoot.Producer Mr Haines has revealed that cast members endured a gruelling boot camp run by “the actual SAS” before filming, saying that the unit’s regimental association embraced the series.The ordeal could await another crop of actors in future, with producers hoping to go beyond the initial six-episode run of the drama, scheduled to air late in the year.New actors could play other influential SAS figures, with Mr Haines suggesting that the series could become like “The Crown” in its historical scope and follow the story of the SAS through the decades.The unit has been involved in numerous conflicts and emergencies, seeing action in the Falklands War, and coming to global attention for their hostage-rescue raid on the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Haines said: “It goes from 1940 right up to the present day in terms of what the SAS are doing. They have been involved in every single conflict, and lots of history along the way.“That’s what we saw as a sort of landscape to play on.”He added that producers “always thought it was a multi-series franchise”, and that Mr Knight has “already planned out in his head what series three and four would be”.The series is based on the book “SAS: Rogue Heroes” by Ben Macintyre.More from NewsFalklanders like us still live with the war every dayRussia-Ukraine latest news: Germany main roadblock to tougher Russian sanctions, Poland’s PM saysKinder eggs recalled due to salmonella fearsPictured: The Bucha mass grave that is so large it can be seen by satellitesEasyJet and British Airways cancellations leave Easter travellers strandedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dirt doesnt matter feminist mantra really need","story":"A fun time was had by all at the Oxford Literary Festival at the weekend. I was sorry to miss the session featuring Rachael Wiseman, one of the authors of Metaphysical Animals, a book about four women who revolutionised Oxford philosophy during and after the war. The most distinguished of them was Elizabeth Anscombe, disciple of Wittgenstein, whom I used to see in my college, looking into the middle distance as if she were pondering higher things. And she almost certainly was. The gist of the book is that men and women do philosophy differently. How differently? Women, said Wiseman, were probably less argumentative. It was too much for Sir Anthony Kenny, a distinguished philosopher himself. Anscombe, he said, was probably the most argumentative person he had ever met. He should know once, she was so engaged in a discussion they were having, she followed him into the bathroom when he was in the tub and sat on the side, still talking. I went to see Sir Anthony this weekend to ask about her. I maintained she should be a feminist pin-up, since she cracked the work-life balance (though feminists would probably balk at her Catholicism). She wore trousers and chain-smoked. And she had seven children – no nannies – while continuing to philosophise, conducting discussions the day after giving birth. How did she do it? Partly by leaving her husband, Peter Geach, to mind the babies lots of the time. But mostly by adopting the dictum “dirt doesn’t matter” when it came to the housekeeping. I’m pinning that one on my kitchen wall. There’s an interesting exhibition on at the Wallace Collection, in London, about the way rococo art influenced Walt Disney and his studio. Yes, really. Apparently, Walt was much taken by Versailles when he was an ambulance driver in France in 1918, had a collection of French porcelain miniatures, and channelled Edmund Dulac’s fairy-story illustrations for Cinderella. But what really comes out is the radical distance between human animation and the computer-generated sort. There are splendid picture sequences for Cinderella, all the work of inidual artists – about half a million for one film. Compare and contrast with contemporary bland CGI images. Beauty and the Beast, a hybrid of the two techniques, was the last watchable Disney film. After that, it’s been all downhill. What, do you reckon, would Winston Churchill have made of the exciting new “happy machines” installed at No 10? You know, like you often get in public lavatories: press sad face if you’re not satisfied with the hygiene a straight face if it’s OK a smiley face if it’s all good. Can you even get your head round what Churchill, or any PM before David Cameron, would have said, back in those days when staff weren’t treated like imbeciles? It’s one of those management hacks that is actually a pretty good indicator of a dysfunctional institution. It’s like those organisations that go to great lengths to provide mental health and resilience workshops, at the same time as laying off staff. What employees would actually say, given a chance, is that if jobs were secure, if people were treated properly, if you knew who to talk to if there’s a problem, you wouldn’t need mental resilience training, or stupid happy machines.More from NewsFalklanders like us still live with the war every dayRussia-Ukraine latest news: Germany main roadblock to tougher Russian sanctions, Poland’s PM saysKinder eggs recalled due to salmonella fearsPictured: The Bucha mass grave that is so large it can be seen by satellitesEasyJet and British Airways cancellations leave Easter travellers strandedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"farmers reject reckless study likens harm red meat sector tobacco","story":"British farmers and scientists are embroiled in a row after a group of academics accused the meat industry of using the same tactics as alcohol, tobacco and fossil fuel companies to play down the harms of meat.  Such comparisons “make no sense” and are “reckless and unjustified”, farmers said. They maintain that meat can play a role in improving both human and environmental health. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) published a first-of-its-kind study looking at how six farming organisations in the UK portray the sector. The scientists said the industry might be attempting to minimise the impact of farming in the minds of the public. Dr Kathryn Clare, lead author from LSHTM, said: “There is growing evidence to suggest that current consumption trends of red and processed meat are a threat to both human health and the health of the planet and this is increasingly being recognised in UK policy spheres. “Our findings suggest that the meat industry may be using various frames that counteract this narrative.Dr James Milner, senior author from LSHTM, added: “These findings should act as a call to action for greater scrutiny of the industry, as addressing people’s appetite for meat will be crucial to efforts to avert climate breakdown and improve public health.”The scientists said the methods employed by farming organisations were in line with a “well-thumbed playbook” used by producers of “other harmful commodities” such as alcohol, tobacco and fossil fuels, to portray their products in a more favourable light.The National Farmers’ Union was the most heavily scrutinised of the six organisations, with ten documents (four reports and six quotes) included in the peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Food Policy. “It is reckless and unjustified for this study to compare the UK livestock sector with commodities such as tobacco and fossil fuels, where there is a very strong scientific consensus about harm to human health and the environment,” Tom Bradshaw, NFU deputy president, told The . “Arguments about diet and food production are much more nuanced, complex and widely debated among scientists.“When customers purchase British red meat products they are buying sustainable, local food, often raised in areas where it is difficult to grow other foods. The same cannot always be said for some highly processed plant-based foods.”A spokesman from Hybu Cig Cymru (Meat Promotion Wales), which was not included in the study, told The : “It makes no sense to compare meat, which has been an important nutritious part of people’s diet for millions of years, with harmful products with no nutritional value, like tobacco.“It’s widely recognised that meat in moderation can be a healthy part of a balanced diet, and independent scientific studies have shown that beef and lamb reared on non-intensive farms in these islands have a far lower emissions footprint than some of the bad environmental practices elsewhere in the world.”More from NewsFalklanders like us still live with the war every dayRussia-Ukraine latest news: Germany main roadblock to tougher Russian sanctions, Poland’s PM saysKinder eggs recalled due to salmonella fearsPictured: The Bucha mass grave that is so large it can be seen by satellitesEasyJet and British Airways cancellations leave Easter travellers strandedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putin found god","story":"It was a sodden spring day in May 2009. A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsFalklanders like us still live with the war every dayRussia-Ukraine

covid","story":"EasyJet cancelled more than 200 flights over the weekend with disruption expected to last into this week as British Airways cancelled 115 flights to and from Heathrow this morning, leaving some passengers stranded amid travel chaos at some of Britain\u0027s biggest airports.EasyJet blamed the problems on high levels of sickness among employees caused by Covid, with at least 222 trips axed since Friday.It said it had made efforts to offset staff shortages by rostering additional standby crew on the weekend but was forced to make additional cancellations for Sunday and Monday.A total of 62 flights scheduled for Monday have been pulled, the majority of which were announced at short notice on Saturday.Passengers have complained of long queues at Heathrow Airport due to staff shortages and additional Covid checks, while British Airways has also been left reeling by last week’s IT meltdown.An easyJet spokesperson said: As a result of the current high rates of Covid infections across Europe, like all businesses easyJet is experiencing higher than usual levels of employee sickness.We have taken action to mitigate this through the rostering of additional standby crew this weekend, however, with the current levels of sickness we have also decided to make some cancellations in advance which were focused on consolidating flights where we have multiple frequencies so customers have more options to rebook their travel, often on the same day.We have made 62 pre-emptive cancellations for flights to and from the UK for tomorrow which represents a small proportion of tomorrow\u0027s total flying programme which was planned to be more than 1,645 flights.We cancelled the majority of these yesterday.It was later confirmed to the PA news agency that at least 222 flights were cancelled across Saturday and Sunday.Some holidaymakers reported being stuck abroad with no explanation or alternative route home offered by the airline.Simon Rudkins, 50, said he was due to return from a ski trip in the Alps with his family when the airline contacted him with less than 10 hours notice saying their flight was cancelled.He told PA that his mother, who is 85 and has dementia, had joined them for the journey back.She gets very confused and she doesn\u0027t need stress, Mr Rudkins said.It comes after passengers were stuck in long queues at Heathrow Airport on Sunday morning as the Easter holidays got under way.The airport attributed the congestion to Covid checks required by destination countries and high passenger volumes.But there were also reports of staff shortages and problems with the e-gate passport checkpoints as travellers took to social media to air their frustrations, with some saying they had waited hours to take off.Other travellers said several of the automatic e-gates, staffed by Border Force and used to process passengers, were not operating properly.The Home Office confirmed there had been a technical issue with the checkpoints which has since been resolved, and said the problem had not caused queues to exceed the standard length at Heathrow.But a Heathrow spokesperson said: Due to high passenger volumes and the Covid documentation checks still required by many end destinations, Terminal 2 departures has experienced some congestion today.Our teams are supporting our airline partners to get passengers away on their journeys as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.More from NewsFalklanders like us still live with the war every dayRussia-Ukraine latest news: Germany main

first world surfing","story":"Cornwall\u0027s Fistral Beach is known as the home of British surfing.But its arch rival and neighbour North Devon has beaten it to a coveted international designation, affording extra protection from developments and pollution that threaten its special waves.An 18.6-mile stretch of the North Devon coastline has been named a World Surfing Reserve by US non-profit Save the Waves Coalition, the first place in the UK to gain the title.The award means groups including Unesco, local charities, scientists and businesses will intervene to protect against developments that might affect the quality of the waves or surfers\u0027 access to the sea.Adam Hall, co-founder of North Devon Surfing Reserve and a lifelong surfer, said that while Cornwall might be well-known as a surfing destination, North Devon had something unique.It\u0027s not purely around what\u0027s more popular, it\u0027s more around the quality of surf, he said.North Devon is very special. Cornwall has a lot of good breaks, it\u0027s very well known, but in North Devon the way the sediment flows out of the Bristol Channel and comes up the north coast means we have very groomed and special waves.We have really special contours of the ocean floor which shape the waves into very, very good quality.One of the reasons we were recognised internationally, and perhaps Cornwall isn\u0027t, is because in such a small area you have this really erse and special set of waves. And it really does suit lots of surfing styles and choices.Traditionalist surfers are well-served by Saunton Sands, while Croyde has the best beach break in the UK which is heavy, powerful and fast, he said.The environmental designations in the area also add to its case for protection, including Unesco\u0027s biosphere scheme and a designation as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, he added.The group has worked with scientists from the University of Plymouth to examine the nature of the area\u0027s waves and how they are created.However Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said he thought Fistral Beach\u0027s reputation as the home of British surfing was absolutely intact.He said North Devon\u0027s beaches won\u0027t beat the flexibility you\u0027ve got in Cornwall and the vast, sheer, number of surfing beaches.The more places that do surfing, the better for the sport and the better for Cornwall. It\u0027s nice for Devon to get something ahead of Cornwall, it\u0027s normally the other way around, if at all. We\u0027re quite sporting that way, he said.The two counties share a healthy rivalry, though Mr Bell admits that Devon is pretty close to perfect.I would say to anybody that Devon is the nearest place to heaven on earth and if you keep going you\u0027ll find heaven, he said.The North Devon site is also the first cold water area in the world to receive the designation. Surf in the UK is often better in the winter.There\u0027s a common misconception that it\u0027s all suntans and board shorts, but we\u0027re all wrapped up head to toe, Mr Hall said.England internationally isn\u0027t well regarded, and that\u0027s been our fault because we held some international contests in August and the travelling surfers came and went \u0027this place is rubbish\u0027.But actually they should have come in September and October, that\u0027s when the waves are great, and it is a bit cold.The group will also campaign against the release of sewage into the sea, an issue which has gained particular attention over the past couple of years.The Environment Agency tests water samples for bacteria during bathing water season, which runs from May to September, but surfers are using the water all year round, the group argues.They also plan to prevent ill-considered development which might affect the way waves break along the shoreline.This has previously happened in Madeira, where famous surf spots were damaged by coastal engineering projects in the early 2000s and in Mundaka, Spain, where surf competitions had to be cancelled for two years after a sandbar was dredged in 2003.Ben Hewitt, a local surfer and former chairman of the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage, who has been helping the group to develop its stewardship plan, said: “There are too many cases around the world where a decision to dredge a sandbar or build a coastal development has destroyed a perfect wave forever or ruined the surfing experience.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Germany main roadblock to tougher Russian sanctions, Poland’s PM saysKinder eggs recalled due to salmonella fearsPictured: The Bucha mass grave that is so large it can be seen by satellitesEasyJet and British Airways cancellations leave Easter travellers strandedThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street staff who partied","story":"Downing Street staff who partied night away before Prince Philips funeral to be finedPartygoers at No who breached Covid lockdown rules on the eve of Prince Philips funeral are set to be financially reprimanded after widespread furyDowning Street staff who partied against Covid- lockdown rules are set to be slapped with the same fines they enforced for millions across the country Image: Getty ImagesByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |comments Downing Street staff who partied in No the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral are set to be slapped with fines.Officials and aides who held a boozy double leaving bash on April  last year have been told they will be hit with fixed penalty notes, according to the .The Partygate event triggered widespread fury when it emerged because coronavirus restrictions in force last spring forced the Queen to grieve for her husband alone at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

The PO scandal - where the ferries firm sacked  staff and replaced them with workers on less than the UK minimum wage - has piled fresh pressure on ministers to bolster protections for staff. But there are fears a Bill aimed at beefing-up rights could be dropped from the Queen’s Speech, where the Government outlines its proposals for new legislation, on May .Trades Union Congress general secretary France O’Grady has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng demanding action.She warned: “If the Government ditches the Employment Bill it will be sending a green light to rogue employers to treat staff like disposable labour.  “After the scandalous events at PO, which have exposed gaping holes in UK employment law, the need for new legislation has never been clearer or more urgent. “There is no excuse for delay. If the Government breaks its promise to enhance workers’ rights working people will have been conned and betrayed. “It’s vital ministers come clean about their plans. “In the wake of PO, the Government can stand on the side of workers and legislate new protections. “Or it can side with bad bosses and abandon its long overdue Employment Bill.” The TUC said the Government had repeatedly offered assurances it would legislate for new workplace protections. GMB union general secretary Gary Smith said: To drop the Employment Bill after the disgraceful PO sackings and widespread use of revolting fire-and-rehire tactics says everything about this Governmentaposs attitude to working people.  Employment rights in our country need to be stronger, and it is simply not good enough for the Government to keep on failing in this key area. In the face of spiralling energy bills, rampant inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis, working people should be able to stand up for their rights at work and organise for better pay. Our country deserves better.

It was not clear whether he planned to slash existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but nations fear he may start to ration energy supplies.Germany and Austria moved a step closer to gas rationing on Wednesday, after activating an emergency plan.Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted the UK should follow suit, before making a a complete U-turn.He first told the BBCaposs Sunday Morning show: We should be making those plans and the Government should be preparing, not necessarily in public, for that situation, and insisted the Government should stop shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels. “But let’s be clear, we’re looking at the images coming out of Ukraine right now, I don’t think we should be talking about going back to business as usual where we just buy large quantities of fossil fuels, he said. Transport Secretary Grant shapps claimed rationing energy supplies is not the route the Government wants to go down on. He told Sunday Morning: I think the summit in Europe, the Germans in particular are very exposed to Russian energy.Mr Shapps added: [The UK is] not as open to shocks directly from Russia as a result of the fact that we donapost get as much oil and gas from them as other countries.Itaposs not the route that we want to go down.  Mr Reynolds, the Shadow Business Secretary, has since rowed back on his comments. Speaking to Times Radio, he said rationing oil and gas would be a disaster for households and businesses. The fact that you’re even asking the question is an indictment of Conservative energy policy over the past decade and the fact that we still haven’t had a plan from the government even though they said it was a priority and an emergency.” The UK has pledged to ban Russian oil imports by the end of this year as Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of slowing down. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,prebidTestLibrary:,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,chatEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,disableAHS:,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,viafouraEnabled:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,smallerFloatParkVideo:true,chameleonfly:true,richaudienceVideoPrebidEnabled:true,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,adMobileBottomSlotFlex:true,ampQuantcastCMPEnabled:true,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amp.aylEnabled:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,improvedigitalVideoPrebidEnabled:true,prebid.sendHBKeys:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,enableUserProfile:true,standaloneMpu:true,smartAdServerDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mantisRecommender:,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,prebidLoadAtRuntime:true,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableCallToActionBar:true,noticationTrayEnabled:true,swipeNavigation:true,customAdExperience:true,adFixedTopSlot:true,ampCommentsEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:auth.reachplc,authUI.env:prod,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,ixDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,commentCountEnabled:true,video.imaVersion:.,videoPrebidEnabled:true,delayVideoAdsUntilConsented:true,fbia.chartbeat.inbody:,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" data-redesign-embed\"true\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the transition would give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports - which make up % of UK demand.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

An Ofsted early years briefing, based on inspections of  providers in January and February, found some children have limited vocabulary while some babies have struggled to respond to basic facial expressions. Wearing face masks continued to have a negative impact on young childrenaposs language and communication skills, it said. Children turning two years old will have been surrounded by adults wearing masks for their whole lives and have therefore been unable to see lip movements or mouth shapes as regularly, the briefing warned.Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman warned the Covid crisis had created some lingering challenges for children.  She said: Iaposm particularly worried about younger childrenaposs development, which,left unaddressed, could potentially cause problems for primary schools down the line.” The report said that “some providers have reported that delays to childrenaposs speech and language development have led to them not socialising with other children as readily as they would have expected previously”. Children have also missed out on conversations or hearing stories, with one provider commenting that young children seemed to have spent more time on screens and had started to use accents and voices from the programmes they had watched. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson blasted inadequate action taken to help children catch up. She told Times Radio: When schools were closed to most children, almost two years ago, that was the point at which planning should have been happening to make up for what came afterwards, to make up for that lost time and to make sure that the support was put in place - that was never properly done.  Had I been secretary of state for education that would have been my number one priority, to make sure that we got that priority plan and the support that children would need given the time they have spent away from school. A Department for Education spokesman said: Our ambitious recovery plan continues to roll out across the country, with nearly £ billion invested in high quality tutoring, world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, additional funding for schools, and extending time in colleges by  hours a year. We have simplied the National Tutoring Programme to reach as many pupils as possible, with funding going directly to schools from next year. The Nuffield Early Language Intervention Programme is also being used by the majority of schools to improve language skills of reception-age children.

It said more than . million homes had at least one OAP aged  or over, who would have been entitled to a free licenceelection vows had been kept.

Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter In total, they will pay more than £m as they battle soaring inflation, council tax hikes and the energy price bombshell. Shadow Culture Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The Tory cost-of-living crisis is hitting pensioners.  “On top of rising energy bills and food prices, many will not be able to afford to keep the TV on - risking isolation and loneliness in old age.” The Tories pledged at the  election to maintain free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run for five years. But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the concession from summer , under a deal agreed in .  The corporation introduced means-testing after warning that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -. Only over-s who receive Pension Credit have been eligible for free licences since August . Older people’s groups called for the leline to be restored as living standards take a battering. Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: The Tory broken promise on free TV licences is heaping worry upon worry for older people as we try to negotiate the cost-of-living storm.  “Thousands are giving up their main connection to the world outside because they canapost afford to pay the £ fee, or flirting with fines by putting off payment. “When you canapost afford to heat and eat properly, the box has to go.” Labour peer Lord George Foulkes, who chairs Westminster’s cross-party group on ageing and older people, said: “Among the many cuts they face this is the cruellest of all.  “It will cut off poor pensioners from information and entertainment at a time when they will need it more than ever. “Ministers should hang their heads in shame having broken solemn promises.” A Government spokesman said: The BBC should be supporting people affected by its decision to stop funding free licence fees for the over-s and treat them with the utmost sensitivity. To support families in the face of rising living costs, we have frozen the cost of a licence fee for two years, are increasing the threshold in which National Insurance Contributions are made, reducing fuel duty by p per litre and providing £m through the Household Support Fund.

Image: Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsA Tory minister today suggested poverty statistics released in the wake of Rishi Sunakaposs spring statement that did little to help struggling families, are somewhat misleading.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he didnapost want to get Brits lost in numbers but said poverty is ided into both absolute and relative. Poverty has been measured in absolute and relative terms to give official a full and accurate picture of how much families have to live on. This does not rule out the fact that around .million Brits will be pushed into absolute poverty, including , children, as the Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. On top of this, campaigners have warned the Governmentaposs decision to cut Universal Credit by £ a week will push , children back into poverty.  Even before the pandemic, around  million children were living in poverty across the UK, the charity Action for Children has noted. The north east of England has seen the most dramatic rise in child poverty in the past five years, the charity says. Speaking on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Mr Shapps said: I don’t want to sort of get us lost in numbers here, but poverty is ided into both absolute and relative , and sometimes the way it’s presented can be somewhat misleading to say the least.“I do not mean to in any way, shape or form underplay it because you don’t have to be an expert – you just look at the cost of living, as you mentioned, the increase in inflation… it’s very substantial. And that’s why the Chancellor’s already come forward with £ billion.” Imran Hussain, Director of Policy, Action for Children has said: Poverty destroys le chances. You cannot level up the country with millions of children in poverty so it’s vital the Government brings forward a credible plan to reduce poverty. Mr Sunakaposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work. Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the analysis from the Resolution Foundation think-tank found. Natalie from Hampshire, a single mum to two children told the Mirror she is worried about rising living costs and struggles to sleep at night. “As a single mum, money is tight. I don’t have a partner or anyone  to help and so the responsibility is completely on me. It can feel overwhelming and scary.” Some months are very hard and, to be honest, I don’t know how I will manage with £ less each month. The other day I turned on the kettle and could see my smart meter clocking the energy used so turned it off. Mr Shapps later admitted the Government might need to bolster support to help struggling families battle the cost-of-living crisis, as he said, “I don’t rule out the fact that we may need to do more.” Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “I feel angry at the scale of the crisis people in this country are facing and the lack of response from Government in the spring statement - and promises on announcements in the future just wonapost cut it. We have set out that windfall tax that would give households a huge amount of help, relative to what the Government are doing - up to £ for households who are most affected by energy prices.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Single mumpovertyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mother of Baby P, who died after months of abuse, could be freed from prison after the Parole Board decided she should be released. Connelly, , was jailed at the Old Bailey in  for causing or allowing the death of her -month-old son Peter at their home in Tottenham, north London, on August  . Known publicly as Baby P, he had suffered more than  injuries - despite being on the at-risk register and receiving  visits from social workers, police officers and health professionals over eight months. Connellyaposs mum Mary O’Connor, , told The Sun : “She needs to be in jail for le, she shouldn’t be out.”She added: “She won’t have changed. To let her out for what she did  You have to be joking.”Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he plans to appeal against the Parole Board decision.Describing the case as harrowing, Mr Raab told the Commons: In light of the Parole Boardaposs direction to release Tracey Connelly, I should inform the House that having carefully read the decision, I have decided to apply to the Parole Board to seek their reconsideration. O’Connor, who has terminal cancer, said: “I’d love to go up to him and say, ‘Don’t let her out’. She’s a b****. Peter died because of her.”Connelly, now , admitted the offence and was handed a sentence of imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of five years. Her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen were convicted of the same offence. A series of reviews identied missed opportunities for officials to save the toddleraposs le had they reacted properly to warning signs. A Parole Board spokesman said on Wednesday: We can confirm that a  of the Parole Board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly following an oral hearing. Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the publicreleased and whether that risk is manageable in the community.  Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority. According to a parole report, at the time of her crimes Connelly, then , got into relationships quickly, used sex to help her feel better about herself and had an inability to control extreme emotions. She was also described as manipulative and lacking in empathy. Connelly was let out on licence in  but recalled to prison in  for breaching her parole conditions by developing intimate personal relationships online and inciting another resident at her accommodation to engage in inappropriate sexualised behaviour. This is her fourth parole review. The decision was meant to be made last year but was delayed to obtain more information. The Parole Board considered Connellyaposs case for a third time in  following previous reviews in  and , and refused to either release her or move her to an open prison. In , she lost an appeal against the latest Parole Board decision not to release her.Since being recalled to prison, Connelly has taken part in a very intensive treatment programme from the Ministry of Justice and the NHS over three years and is now able to work openly and honestly with professionals, the report added. The Parole Board said it was satisfied Connelly is suitable for release after hearing she is now considered to be at low risk of committing a further offence and that her probation officers and prison officials support the plan. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab was represented throughout the review and his representative confirmed that this recommendation was accepted, the report said. Connelly will be subject to restrictions on her movements, activities and who she contacts, and faces  extra licence conditions. They include living at a specied address, being supervised by probation, wearing an electronic tag, adhering to a curfew and having to disclose her relationships.

Mr Hughes linked up with the family two weeks ago after taking to social media to offer to sponsor refugees escaping the violence. It is hoped the family-of-four will be able to move into the property by April their visas are confirmed in time and, for now, local people are helping to get it ready for their arrival.  Mr Hughes, who started working at a telecoms company when he was , said it was absolutely devastating watching millions of people fleeing - the bombs going off and decided to help. He considered creating an annex in his own home to offer to a refugee family but soon realised it would have taken about two years to convert, as well as being too cramped and lacking in privacy.However, after viewing empty properties in Wrexham, he decided to make an offer which was then accepted, BBC News reported. Maria, who is currently still in western Ukraine with her children, said she couldnapost believe it and told Mr Hughes he was so kind. She told him youaposve done enough when he also offered her money to flee the war-torn the country. The family are currently on their way to a refugee camp in Poland, where they can register for papers to become refugees in the UK.Family friend Julie Simkins said the community had been absolutely incredible amid an effort to prepare the house through a Facebook group called Wrexham and Ukraine United. She added: Theyaposve been rallying round to help with donations and are ready to embrace her and the boys. She said thanks to the sofas, beds, washing machines and fridge freezers that have been gted, weaposre pretty much good to go with furnishing the entire house now. Mr Hughes said Maria, who worked in anaesthetics at a Ukrainian hospital, will be put in touch with people at the local hospital to discuss job opportunities when she arrives in the UK.

The UK Health Security Agencysaid it was looking at the XE iant, which is a mutation of the BA. and BA. Omicron strains.It is whataposs known as a recombinant - meaning it has been formed from at least two other viral sources. Experts at the UKHSA say itaposs too early to know whether it is more transmissible than previous strains like Delta and Omicron. The body said that  cases of XE had been detected in England as of March . That would make it only a fraction of the tens of thousands of total cases being reported each day at the moment, The Independent has reported. The UKHSA said that initial growth rates for XE were not much dferent from BA., Wales Online reports.However, more recent data, up to March , showed a rate of nearly % above BA., which has been called aposStealthapos Omicron. It said that as this estimate has not remained consistent as new data have been added, it cannot yet be interpreted as an estimate of growth advantage for the recombinant.Numbers were too small for the XE recombinant to be analysed by region, the UKHSA said. Professor Susan Hopkins, the UKHSAaposs chief medical advisor transition lead, said that recombinant iants were not uncommon. She added that they usually died off quickly. “This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a iable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage, Ms Hopkins told The Sun. “So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness.”  With no legal restrictions now in place in England and the requirements to self-isolate removed, recent weeks have seen record numbers of people catching Covid. The Office for National Statistics said one in every  people - or .million - had the virus in the week ending March , up from .million in the previous week.Just days ago the Governmentaposs Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned the next Covid iant could be worse than Omicron as the virus continues to evolve.The Governmentaposs Chief Scientic Adviser said it is a mistake to believe the more Covid evolves, the less serious its mutations will become.

Details published on the city council’s planning portal reveal there were  public comments submitted within  days. Of those,  were objections and  comments of support.  Only  consultations were made. The consultations appear to have been made to people who live in nearby properties. The couple had paid £, over the £, asking price for the three-bedroom bungalow in the trendy city borough with views of Edinburgh Castle. Their ultra modern plans would see the original single-storey building demolished and replaced with a three-storey mansion. The large house is set to feature a zinc exterior, five glass-fronted bedrooms and a driveway rising from the garden. The couple have even submitted an application to have the project featured on Grand Designs with Kevin McCloud.  Their planning agents said the building would make a “signicant statement”. A source told The Sun: “This is a pretty signicant and ambitious development. Neighbours have been notied of the plans and they have a right to have their views.” Details of why people object to the plans will not be revealed until after a decision has been made later this month.

And as so often with the Tories, they talk tough on crime, only to go weak on the causes of it. Just look at the mess they have made of the Met.

He bonded with law graduate Amani Liaquat as they both battled terminal brain tumours. Amani was frightened she was dying. Tom kept assuring her she was not. Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure. The best legacy Amani and Tom could wish for is for the Government to agree to provide much more financial support.Darwin a loser We tracked down canoe fraudster John Darwin to the Philippines, where his we told us he will make nothing from a new TV drama about his extraordinary fraud.

The list was quietly extended on Friday afternoon more than two years into the pandemic. Only three official Covid symptoms were listed previously- a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to the sense of smell or taste. They were all introduced earlier on in the pandemic and have been kept on the list ever since. But now the list has been quickly updated to reflect new iants of the virus.  The update comes nine months of reports that iants of Covid were causing dferent reactions in people and leaving them with dferent symptoms. The new symptoms now list the following signs:A high temperature or shivering– a high temperature means you feel hot to touch on your chest or backA new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or  or more coughing episodes in  hours A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste Shortness of breath Feeling tired or exhausted An aching body A headache A sore throat A blocked or runny nose Loss of appetite Diarrhoea Feeling sick or being sickAfter listing the symptoms, the NHS website highlights: “The symptoms are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu.”Previously, when people exhibited any of the symptoms, “evenmild”, you were advised to get tested as soon as possible. However, now under new Government guidance, you are simply advised to stay home and avoid contact with other peopleyou have symptoms as well as a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to go to work or do your normal activities.

Janine Adamson, , first realised she was pregnant while still in the process of applying for university, but didnapost want this to affect her studies.She also wanted to ensure she maintained a strong bond with her baby son, Tommy Adamson, and was keen for him to attend lectures with her at Solent University, Southampton.The determined mum wanted toto campus with Tommy just two weeks after giving birth in January. However, she claims senior members of staff sought to stop this from happening, deeming little Tommyaposs presence in lecture theatres as aposinappropriateapos.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Despite this, Janine, from Bitterne, Southampton, has continued to bring Tommy to lectures in a chest sling, allowing her to continue learning while keeping her newborn close.Although one tutor did ask her classmatesanyone had any problem with her being there, it turned out that nobody did, and so she has since settled back into her course without staff intervening. However, Janine claims she felt intimidated by suggestions that she should simply defer her degree and spend time looking after her baby instead, and felt that the institution was trying to kick her out. Solent University has since stated that they do permit babies and children on campus. However, such requests are granted on a aposcase-by-case basis and are said to be subject to a risk assessment.In Janineaposs case, a lecturer emailed to inform her that they had reconsidered her wish to bring Tommy along to class, and apologised that they were not able to agree to her request, which they described as inappropriate. Unperturbed, mum-of-three Janine even plans to buy Tommy his own miniature cap and gown so that he can aposgraduateapos alongside her. Janine, who also lives with children Bradley, , and Maizie, , and her partner Owen Roundell-Prince, , has explained that being put on furlough during lockdown gave her time to reflect to aposre-evaluate her le. In , she decided to leave her watch-fixing job, and sign up for a college access course in social science and humanities, with the intention of studying criminal investigation with forensic psychology at university. She began her course at Solent University back in October , attending classes two days per week while pregnant with Tommy.A TikTok video showing Janine and Tommy at uni the day after heron February  has since gone viral, with many followers impressed by the hardworking mumaposs resilience. However, she says being told I wasnapost allowed tohas been more stressful than my studies. Janine said: I felt like uni wanted to kick me out and they didnapost want me there, but there is no policy in place on it, so I just went anyway because Iaposm paying for my education. I had asked my lecturersthey didnapost mind and they said it was fine. One of them wanted to confirm with [other senior staff], but then I got an email telling me I canapostwith my baby. They palmed me off by saying it wasnapost fair on other students. When my lecturer told me I just broke down in tears and thought everything Iaposd worked hard for has gone to waste. I didnapost want to ask for uni to support me in any other way apart from me just getting on with it. I didnapost want anything from anyone. Just to put my baby in a sling and carry on. She continued: They told me that most students defer for a year, but Iaposm not most students. Iaposve already deferred my whole le and I donapost want the fact that Iaposve got a baby to put me back again. They kept telling me to focus on my recovery even though I only wanted two weeks off, so I just stopped communicating with them and went. I felt really intimidated and worried about getting turned away. One lecturer askedanyone objected to me being there while I was in the class, but nobody did so I was allowed to stay. Theyaposre supporting me now but I feel like itaposs short term and I feel like Iaposll have to find childcare, but Iaposm hoping something changes by then. I take each day as it comes. Going forward, Janine hopes her story will encourage more universities to introduce supportive policies for mothers who would like to bring their children along to class with them. A spokesperson for Solent University has given the following statement: The university is committed to supporting all students who are parents and permits babies and children on campus. However, the primaryand design of our campus is to provide teaching, learning and support for students. Babies are currently permitted in classthe student has pre-arranged this and has an agreement from the course team. A risk assessment, that includes health and safety considerations and an understanding of any potential disruptions to learning, is part of the process. Babies being on campus is currently managed on a case-by-case basis following discussions between the studentand course team. The statement continues: Students are encouraged to consider suspension of studiesthey have a baby during the academic year. This is in line with maternity policies within the workplace and recognises the demands on new mothers and academic study. Should a student with a new-born not wish to suspend their studies, a discussion between them and the course team is necessary to establish how this will take place. This has always worked well in the past and we are looking to introduce a policy that will formalise our approach.Do you have an interesting parenting-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Ben said: In  a womanaposs body was found floating in the well, and five years later the stonemason shot himself with his shotgun and died. I risked my le going into the building to get some footage but I think it was definitely worth it. The mansion was last lived in in the s and has suffered considerable damage, which means it has fallen into disrepair after becoming abandoned and left to rot. He said: The manor was last inhabited in the s and since then has become more weather damaged over the years, just like many of the English Heritage buildings that donapost get looked after properly.It is thought the history of the mansion goes back to the Tudor times and has since been remodelled and redeveloped over the years. There are tributes to its past with plaques dated back to the th century on the walls of the mansion.  The YouTuber said: The history of the location goes all the way back to Tudor times. However, it has obviously redeveloped and remodelled throughout the years. There are plaques on the walls that also date back to the th century. As Ben explored further into the eerie house, he stumbled across a statue of the Greek god Poseidon in the middle of the courtyard.  He said: Some of my favourite parts of the exploration were the Poseidon statue in the middle of the courtyard which is missing its trident in his right hand. Itaposs either been removed due to protection of value or thieves have already taken it.  After entering the scary mansion, Ben was pleasantly surprised how some parts of the emptied building were in such good condition, but was also aware some other parts of the building were less so and he did not want to enter for the fear of his le. He added: Getting inside the old manoraposs main parts was another highlight for me because, as you can see towards the end of the video, it was a surprise that some parts are in great condition and that other parts could cost you your le entering the room.

Octopusapos freebie has been well received but other energy suppliers have been slammed for their energy-saving tips. Ovo was criticised last year for telling struggling customers to do star jumps or cuddle a pet to keep warm. Bills have skyrocketed for millions from the start of this month and the new financial year, with a national insurance tax hike, unprecedented fuel costs and inflation. But the biggest hitter by far has been the increased price cap on energy bills which saw regulator OFGEM up the cap to £, from April .  The move means that the average household energy bill in the UK will go up by nearly £ annually. Experts have warned it will push millions into poverty and forced to choose between heating and eating.

Thankfully, Elliotaposs angry at the world face changed within the day. Jamie-Lee said: I don’t think there is any harm in stating the obvious about a newborn. His dad Ashleigh, laughed and I could tell it was because he agreed. Thankfully, his face went down after a few hours and he looked adorable. I’m not a serious person hence why I openly said he isn’t cute at birth.  “But some people may take offence so I wouldn’t advise others to say what they think out loudthey are with a serious mum.” Now, three years on, Elliot’s face when annoyed resembles his face at birth.

And what a heart-breaking yet inspirational story it is. Jenni’s painful journey was unique:She was at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield and witnessed the horror unfold, she took a ticket for a seat, allowing Sarah, , and -year-old Vicki and her husband to stand on the terraces, and she spent the next three decades campaigning for justice. And it took a crushing toll.She said: “It was coming up to Vicki’s st in  when reality kicked in and I realised I was no longer a mum or a we. I was this person on my own and couldn’t work out where my place in the world was. “For two years I went to a very dark place. I just couldn’t cope at all. The nightmares were so bad I was frightened to go to bed. I’d dream about the sights I saw at Hillsborough and when I woke up I could still see dying people lying on my bedroom floor. It was literally a living nightmare. I never want to go back to that place.” Five years earlier, Jenni had been through the ultimate living nightmare, as she walked around Sheffield in a daze not knowingher husband and daughters survived the crush. When news of Vicki’s death was broken to her at a hospital, Jenni was told she could not see her because she was now the property of the South Yorkshire coroner.“Being told my daughter was nothing to do with me just seemed utterly surreal. The way we were treated at the mortuary was horrendous. “There wasn’t one ounce of compassion. I wonder how I coped. It must have been because the shock left me disconnected from reality.” Making the pain even harder to bear were the lies spread by police, politicians and certain media, about the events of the day. One, printed in a newspaper, cut like a kne to her heart. An unnamed policeman claimed as he tried to revive a teenage girl, some Liverpool fans shouted “throw her up here and we will **** her”.  Jenni found that utterly despicable. “It was a complete lie. I was with the fans and they were heroes that day. “How low can you go to print an unsubstantiated report about something so vile being said about a person who could have been my dying -year-old daughter  It’s beyond belief,” she said. As often happens when a couple lose children in high-profile circumstances, the strain on their relationship became unbearable and their marriage broke down. As Jenni puts it: “We were two damaged people.”She moved up to Liverpool to be close to where the girls were buried and did a degree at John Moores University in criminal justice and psychology, socialising with Sarah’s closest friends who were still at uni. She said: “It was my crazy time. Young people accepted me. They let me do what I wanted whereas my own generation was trying to give me advice. And being with Sarah’s friends allowed me to reminisce about her.” As someone who was at Hillsborough I have always suffered survivors’ guilt, but my guilt is nothing compared with Jenni’s.  “There’s guilt that it should have been me that died because I was in the stands and they stood on the terrace,” she said. “But the real sense of guilt I feel is that I was the fan who introduced the girls to the club. “Although I came from Yorkshire I’d been into Liverpool since I was . I still have days when I think ‘ only I hadn’t been a fan’. I feel terrible guilt about that.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The cover-up shocked a woman who, with a successful businessman for a husband and a nice house in Middlesex, considered herself part of a model Middle England family. “Before Hillsborough I thought I lived in a good country,” she said. “I trusted the police and the government, then I saw first hand the corruption which went right to the very top. And I mean to the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. “It changed my whole outlook on le and it was a hard lesson to learn at a time when I was trying to cope with the grief of losing my children.”Could she ever forgive  “If the police had held their hands up right from the start and admitted what happened maybe in time I’d have found some forgiveness but I certainly could not forgive them for the lies they made up about the fans. “And I can’t accept that not a single police officer has been made accountable for what happened when an inquest found the  were all unlawfully killed. How can we have a justice system that allows that to happen  We need the Hillsborough Law, because without it every citizen in this country is in danger of falling into the same position as me.” Does she ever wonder what le would be likethat day hadn’t happened  She said: “All the time. I look at friends with grandchildren, see how it enriches their le and I do wonder. “Sometimes I daydream about the girls coming round with their partners for Sunday lunch. But I have to stop thinking about that because it’s like chasing rainbows isn’t it   “The le I thought I’d have was taken away and I’ve had to go down a completely dferent route. I think I’m a kinder person after all I’ve had to learn from the pain and suffering. “Hillsborough turned some people bitter and angry but I couldn’t live with that because I haven’t got a safety net. I’ve got lovely friends but they’ve got their own lives. “The pain is lurking all the time. I can have days when I’m positive about things and crash days when the pain makes me feel I’ve gone right back to the beginning.“But I need to live the best le I can. How can I throw it away when my daughters’ lives were takenso cruelly My girls will always walk alongside me.

She was later aposambushedapos with an allegation she had also kissed the nursery age pupil, an employment tribunal heard. Although she aposvehemently deniedapos this allegation, she was eventually sacked for gross misconduct. However her former employers Pioneer Learning Trust have now been ordered to pay Mrs Willmott £,. in compensation after she won a case of unfair dismissal. The tribunal, held in Watford, Herts, heard Mrs Willmott started working as a level one teaching assistant at Whitefield Primary Academy in Luton, Beds, in January .In October  she was assigned to a child in the schoolapos s nursery who required support from a teaching assistant because of his special needs. In January , as a result of the pupilaposs behaviour, the nursery teachers asked that he be removed from the main room to the separate aposNestapos room to be supervised. Mrs Willmott was asked to continue to work with the child in the aposNestapos. The tribunal heard that, two days later, Mrs Willmott asked the child to do something and he aposreacted badlyapos to this request. She said she was concerned he was going to physically harm himself and then aposplaced her arms around him in a hug to prevent a physical outburst to intervene before an outburst commencedapos. The following Monday, a meeting was called after a local authority safeguarding officer raised concerns about the hugging incident. Mrs Willmott was told an allegation had been made against her that she had behaved aposinappropriately towards the child by hugging him and kissing himapos.She aposstrongly and vehemently deniedapos that she had kissed the child but admitted embracing him, adding she had hugged the child aposto calm him down because he was really upsetapos. The tribunal heard Mrs Willmott was aposvery distressedapos by the allegation of kissing because of the aposvery serious ramicationsapos it could lead to. As a result, she was signed off work by her GP with acute stress. In February  another teaching assistant told bosses she saw Mrs Willmott get on her knees, put the pupilaposs coat on, talk to him, do up his coat and give him a kiss on the right cheek. The witness said that she did not see anything  and added Mrs Willmott was aposvery touchy-feelyapos and that it was usual for her to aposcuddleapos the child. A disciplinary meeting was held over Zoom in July  to hear allegations of gross misconduct, but the kissing allegation against Mrs Willomott was dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, she was still sacked. In the letter confirming her dismissal, it was stated that it was aposthe responsibility of all staff to ensure that they did not abuse or appear to abuse their position of trust and extend relationships beyond what was considered to be professional and acceptableapos. But Employment Judge Bellamy Forde ruled the hugging incident did not amount to gross misconduct. He said: I accept that it is likely that [Mrs Willmott] should have been wary of inviting the child for a hug and that [she] was aware of the risks associated with doing this. I do not accept that hugging would always amount to gross misconduct...accordingly, I find that [Mrs Willmott] was unfairly dismissed.

The simple mechanism uses litmus paper and solution to highlight that the test has worked successfully with one line, and a second red linethe virus is present in your saliva. Around one in three people with the virus don’t show symptoms, so can spread to others without knowing, according to NHS Inform. According to the Gov.uk website, lateral flow tests can be less sensitive when a person has lower levels of the virus in their system.The Government guidance states that “… even faint lines, shows the test is positive”. It adds: “Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported.”So while youaposre seeing a faint second line, it is likely you are positive and currently infected with coronavirus. You should report this test result and carry out a PCR to confirm the result. Lateral Flow tests were previously available for free from the Government website and available over the counter at most pharmacies. But the scheme was scrapped by the UK Government with the change coming into effect from April . The decision to end universal free testing has been controversial, with many criticising the move. LFTs are still available for free in Scotland until the end of this month. Last week, the office of National Statistics reported that Covid infections reached a new record, with an estimated .million Brits testing positive with the virus.  The figures were up by around , from the previous week and have prompted fresh concerns after all lockdown restrictions were lted just a month earlier. Covid expert, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned that the world needs to be ready for another pandemic. He told the Royal Society Conference that another pandemic was certain and that Covid could reset and dodge all future vaccines.

Jacquie said: I got to the point where I stopped going out with him. Every time there would be something at the end of the night, an argument with a taxi driver or some kind of disagreement. On July , , their family planned a get-together at the sistersapos houses. The men of the family, including Reid, gathered at Jacquie’s house and the two sisters and their mum at Gina’s. Jacquie said: The lads were there enjoying the music, we were having a glass of wine. It was a lovely evening in both houses. Then, around midnight, after Reid bared his bum to the group, the sister’s parents decided to leave. Jacquie said: Paul saw them out to the taxi and when he appeared, it was like a dferent person had come into the room. “He was edgy, confrontational and wanted a row. He clapped his hands together and said aposright.... what the f*** is all this Black Lives Matter apos It was like, aposhere we go... Letaposs startapos. Reid continued to rant about the church, and about the singer Prince, who he was putting obscene allegations against. Gina described the situation as heated and she said: My brother Eugene left and myself, my other brother Adrian and my nephew Jack went back to my house but I could hear Jacquie next door saying aposdonapost push me.apos Jacquie questioned him on why he ruined a lovely evening. She said: He was right up to me and he was that angry there was spit coming out of his mouth and he was shouting at me. “He pushed me and heaposd never been physically violent to me before. It was a shock. I said aposdo not push meapos and he did it again. “Gina, my brother and my nephew were stood on the patio next door and they could hear me shouting. Gina refused to leave her there and she said: I went back in and said to him aposenough. Just stop. Reid grabbed Gina by her top and threw her on the sofa, punching her. Her brother Adrian pulled her to safety and her nephew Jack restrained Reid.  As things seemed to calm down, Jack released Reid but he jumped up and grabbed an ornament from the conservatory windowsill. Jacquie said: He pulled it back with his arm with such force, I shouted aposnoapos. We were in a conservatory. He was going to cause damage to something or someone. As the vase hit Ginaaposs face her vision went straight away with blood poured down her face leaving her iris was hanging from the socket on her cheek. She said: My world turned black. The rush of pain and the panic I felt holding my eye as the blood poured down my face will never leave me. I was afraid of who in my family he would harm next. Gina was taken to Wigan Royal Infirmary before being transferred to Manchester Eye Hospital for further treatment. Surgeons battled to save her eyeball, which had shrunk, and tried to save her sight. Sadly she has never been able to see out of her left eye again. In October , after three operations, doctors broke the news to Gina that her sight would never . Jacquie described the  hope of each operation as “soul destroying” at a time their dad was dying of cancer. On top of that, Gina had to cancel a trip to Australia to see her son and grandson because of the injuries.The day after the attack, Jacquie spoke to Reid and told him Gina may lose her sight. She said Reid became aggressive before packing his bags and leaving for Ireland. Jacquie said: I didnapost see him again. A -year relationship, gone. Two weeks later he gave me an houraposs notice to say he was coming to collect his stuff. There was a van outside with two lads in it waiting. “Everything he owned, Iaposd packed ready to pick up. When he got home I panicked and ran to ask a neighbour to help me bring his bags to the driveway. Everything was bagged, labelled and wrapped. That is how conditioned I was. He turned up and came to the front door. He asked for his TV, and so I gave him his TV. He asked for the Virgin boxes, and then in this order he asked for his Nutribullet, his fridge magnets and his mugs. Then after that he just said, aposhowaposs Gina apos. I said aposhow dare you apos. He didnapost show any remorse. He was cocky, right up until the sentence. How can you be like that  She was like a sister to him. Reid never once said sorry despite claiming in court he had wanted to. Gina is now beginning to rebuild her le, but she says the impact of the attack still looms large. She continued: It is simple things too. I canapost put eyeshadow on because you have to close one eye and I canapost see. Shaving under my arms is dficult.Some days I feel better but there are days when my eye hurts or it itches. I am just glad I have such a good family and good friends. I a just glad I have had those people to help me along the way. Doctors have made a coloured contact lens to improve the appearance of Ginaaposs eye, but her left eye is visibly smaller than her right. She said: I feel self-conscious and embarrassed, especially after a male colleague who saw me said, without meaning any harm, aposyou eyes were one of your best features.apos That hurt so much.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

She said: The one thing I always said was aposwhen I die they can take everything except my eyes.apos I used to have lovely, big brown eyes. Not anymore. Gina said: Iaposm glad he has got justice. Iaposm glad he will have this on his record. His aggressive, threatening, bullying behaviour is what put him in jail, while I am left with monocular vision, scarring to my face and a whole new lestyle to adjust to. Jacquie added: He presented himself as a professional. He was a good forklt instructor and people liked him, but they didnapost see this other side of him. It was laid bare in court.

The anonymous woman took to Reddit to explain how her soon-to-be husband wants to cut her out her of wedding dress on their special night.They even have a special kne they use to do it and the next day everybody makes a big deal about the cut-up dress, she wrote. I told my fiancé I don’t want to do it but he said he wants to and that it’s the only tradition he isn’t willing to budge on. There are other traditions he’s agreed to scrap, but he said this one is harmless and it’s important to him that we keep some of their traditions. Do you think the fiancéaposs request is unreasonable  Let us know your thoughts in the comments section belowThe woman added that her fiancé and his family are now aposupsetapos with her, as they feel like sheaposs aposerasing so many of their important traditionsapos. The post, which has received more than a thousand comments, sparked outrage online - with many urging the fiancée to aposreconsiderapos the marriage altogether. One user wrote: This was a tradition for several dferent peoples cultures from back in medieval and Victorian times. You know, back when women were property, not people. It has no place in modern society, in my opinion. Another commented: Besides the fact that the tradition is disgusting, appalling, and should absolutely not happen,they want to cut a dress up, the groomaposs family can pony up and either buy her a duplicate of her exact wedding dress or any wedding dress of her choosing. A third branded the whole thing aposdisturbingapos, adding: The men dragging the bride and groom to their room once the wedding is over and offering encouragements from outside, being woken up early the next day by the women in the family so they can help you get ready , the groom having to buy back his bride. % NTA, OP. This whole thing is beyond disturbing.  Cutting the dress isnapost the only disturbing tradition linked to weddings. The introduction of wearing a veil wasnapost to give the bride a dramatic chic look.In fact, they were first introduced to protect brides from the evil eye and jealousy. And during the times of arranged marriages, the bride’s face would be covered until the groom had committed to the marriage, as the fear was he’d think she was ugly and bolt for the exit.

In a video shared via TikTok, Adrian Ghervan, from London, could be seen pouring a portion of brown basmati rice into a glass, which he then filled up with a can of Coca-Cola.Adrian then wrapped the glass in clingfilm before setting it aside for a full  hours, during which time he claims the rice will have been perfectly cooked. The rice - which had absorbed the soft drink at this point - did indeed resemble the size and texture of cooked rice, however, a number of his followers were sceptical about how cooked it actually was. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Adrianaposs original post has so far clocked up more than , likes and has raised more than a few eyebrows. Many have noted that this method could actually prove pretty dangerous, given that the rice isnapost technically cooked. One person shuddered: Isnapost that how you get food poisoning ” While another pointed out: “Mate it’s not cooked it’s just soaked. A third suggested: “Why not just boil it for  minutes, quicker, cheaper and you don’t need to add a sugary chemical drink.According toHealthline,eating raw or undercooked rice can increase a personaposs risk of food poisoning, given that rice can harbour harmful bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus . Although this bacteria isnapost usually a concern with freshly cooked rice, when it comes to raw, uncooked, or improperly stored rice, the cooler temperatures could well cause it to grow. With this in mind, foodies should be very careful when it comes to how they cook their rice and should know that cooking rice at high temperatures minimizes the growth of harmful bacteria.This most recent video comes shortly after Adrian went viral for frying an egg using tea-light candles, claiming this to be an efficient way to save on energy bills.Do you have an unusual cooking hack to share  We pay for stories.

She said: My date didn’t tip after dinner because we weren’t brought enough bread. We went to a little Italian restaurant, and towards the end of dinner, he got very quiet. I asked what was up, and he said he was seeing that while we only got two pieces of bread, all the other tables were being served more. He said something about him being more attentive to these things as someone who runs a business, and it makes him wonder aposwhat’s going onapos. I just nodded along but thought he was overthinking what was probably just a simple human error. Then when the cheque came, he didn’t tip. He said, aposthey need to do betterapos and said something to the waiter on the way out. Not gonna lie, I was mortied. In the US, many people in the service industry rely on tips to make ends meet as they are not paid a reasonable base wage, so the woman was horried to see her date refuse to leave a tip.  She added: I think how people treat servers is incredibly indicative of the type of person they are. Especially considering that most restaurant staff have to live off of their tips, not wages. Not tipping at all seems like an extreme reaction to being shorted a piece of bread or two. It could have been an honest mistake, and easily remedied in a second. I had a good experience at the restaurant, and it’s not like the server was rude or anything bad happened. So, is this a red flag  Should I talk to him about it  I really like him but this has not been sitting well with me at all. Commenters on the Reddit post were in agreement with the woman that his behaviour says a lot about him, and many encouraged her to reconsider further dateshis actions put her off. One person said: Being mortied by a personaposs actions, whatever they may be, on a second date is enough to stop seeing someone. While another added: Itaposs the second date, you honestly donapost even need to take the time to confront himit makes you feel uncomfortable. At most,he asks you out again, say that people who are rude to serving staff are a huge turn off and youaposre not interested anymore, and then block him.

Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction.It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die.The numbers of dead in the Kyiv Oblast town are suspected to stretch into the hundreds.Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, which leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade which occupied Bucha, is the first senior military official connected to the massacre to be named.  Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs. He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  “How do I explain this to myself, how  They must cease to exist. “They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia rather than Kyiv Oblast - and a number of other Russian military units.Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region...  “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. Forces from several other groups are also suspected of being in the town, including those from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district and the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision. So far Omurbekov is the only commander to be named. Russian sources have denied that they are responsible for the massacre, claiming that the Ukrainian army slaughtered its own people. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US.  “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia for the massacre, which she said was a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks.The unsupported claims from Russian officials are typical of those which have been heard throughout the invasion and clearly aim to sow doubt and ision within Ukraine and its allies. The scale of the massacre and its depraved nature has prompted a response from Western leaders, while it has been reported that Boris Johnson will seek to galvanise a tough response from allies to the crisis.On its rd anniversary, the Prime Minister will hail Nato as the greatest security alliance in the history of the world - adding that it has a responsibility to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for freedom with every fibre of their being. It comes after the PM condemned Russiaaposs despicable attacks against Ukrainian civilians in Irpin and Bucha, adding that we will not rest until justice is served. This week he will welcome the Polish and German leaders to Downing Street for discussions on Nato and how to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russian aggression. On Sunday, Mr Johnson said no denial or disinformation from the Kremlin can conceal that President Vladimir Putin is desperate and his invasion is failing. An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said dead civilians had been found on the streets of the small city of Bucha and the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, in what resembled a horror movie.In Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers used cables to drag bodies off a street - from a distance due to fears they may be booby-trapped - as Russian troops withdraw and focus attacks on other parts of Ukraine. Ukraineaposs prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the bodies of  civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In a statement, Mr Johnson said the UK was stepping up its sanctions and military support, and bolstering humanitarian help for those on the ground. He added: The UK has been at the forefront of supporting the International Criminal Courtapossinvestigation into atrocities committed in Ukraine.  The Justice Secretary has authorised additional financial support and the deployment of specialist investigators - we will not rest until justice is served.Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha must be investigated as war crimes.Ms Truss said the UK would not rest until those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine had faced justice, adding that Russia would not be allowed to cover up its involvement through cynical disinformation. Mr Zelenskyaposs spokesman Sergey Nikorov said authorities in Ukraine had found what looked exactly like war crimes, including the bodies of executed civilians and mass graves.

The Lithuanian film director’s death was confirmed by the Ukrainian Defence Minister and a colleague. A Lithuanian news agency, min, reported that Mr Kvedaravicius was rushed to a hospital but could not be saved. The ministry’s information agency tweeting today: Whiletrying to leave Mariupol, Russian occupiers killed Lithuanian director Mantas Kvedaravicius”.Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: We lost a creator well known in Lithuania and in the whole world who, until the very last moment, in spite of danger, worked in Russia-occupied Ukraine.”The -year-old was best known for his conflict-zone documentary Mariupolis, which premiered in  at the Berlin International Film Festival.  It showed a city, a strategic port in a mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have clashed with Ukrainian forces since .Mariupol was one of the main targets of Russia ’s invasion when it began on February .The city has spent weeks being bombed and reduced to rubble, with tens of thousands still trapped.Mantas Kvedaravicius, was murdered today in Mariupol, with a camera in his hands, in this s***** war of evil, against the whole world, Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, founder of the Artdocfest arts festival in which Kvedaravicius was a participant, said on Facebook.Kvedaravicius also won an award for his  film ‘Barzakh’ which was shot in the Russian region of Chechnya, where the country fought two wars to put down rebellions between  and .

This courage, this unconditional will to show human rights violations and make them accessible to the public, distinguished Mantas Kvedaravicius. Inside the terrorised city of Mariupol, civilians are almost entirely without food, water and electricity as temperatures plummet below zero at night. Many are unable to leave their shelters due to the ongoing Russian missile strikes and shelling and loved ones cannot let their family and friends outside know they’re still alive. The city has seen some of the worst Russian atrocities including the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital, and of a theatre where thousands of innocents were sheltering. Mariupol’s residents even wrote ‘children’ in Russian outside the theatre in hope Putin’s forces would not attack it.

The -year-old was rumbled by authorities in Germanyaposs eastern states of Saxony and Saxony-Halt after visiting a number of vaccine centres three times a day In Saxony alone, he was found to have logged a massive  vaccinations, the Freie Presse newspaper reports.He was caught out when a member of staff at a Dresden facility recognised him from a previous visit, according to the German Red Cross. Cops eventually arrested the vaccine cheat when he entered another town, near to Leipzig, where he was then detained. The German Red Cross has pressed charges and suspect him of being involved in the lucrative trade in fake vaccine passports. Police in other German states have also launched investigations of their own, DPA reports.  Authorities identied  occasions the man took a jab, but itaposs thought the true number is far higher. According to reports, every time he entered the facility he would take a blank vaccination form with him, and then resell the part of the document detailing batch numbers to anti-vaxxers.

Vladimir Putinaposs war effort is ironically reliant on the manufacturing power of the nation heaposs invaded, with his warships, tanks, missiles and fighter jets needing components from the opposition, sources say.It comes as there is a desperate hunt for the Butchers of Bucha after women and children were raped and shot by Russians, according to Ukrainian sources. Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction.It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die. Moscow has said it will reduce military activity near primary targets Kyiv and Chernihiv amid peace talks - though such claims have been met with skepticism.  Ukraine and the West fear the Kremlin is simply looking to regroup before moving its focus on the Donbas region, rather than to try and promote trust.Putin could also look to use the southern port city of Mariupol, which has been decimated by Russian bombs, to more easily ship fresh supplies for a second wave attack.Senior defence sources told thethe Kremlinaposs military stocks are pretty bad as the invasion effort continues to drag on beyond initial estimations. Soldiers are said to be running low on weapons, while the withdrawal from Kyiv has meant dozens of tanks being abandoned. Meanwhile, the likes of the T- tank, a key component in Moscowaposs arsenal, needs parts said to be made in the eastern Ukrainian city of Izyum, which invading troops have failed to capture. Some estimates suggest defending troops have taken or destroyed at least , tanks and armoured vehicles.

The move is eerily similar to tactics employed by Soviet-era dictators like Joseph Stalin and his secret police, the NKVD. A telephone hotline and website have been set up that allow “good citizens” to report “traitors”. The Kremlin has reportedly sent Russian citizens in several regions texts with instructions how to report one another, with outspoken voices being tossed into jail. Any Russian wishing to rat out their fellow citizen can also use a dedicated channel on the social media .  This led to a young -year-old shop assistant spending  hours in a cell this week after they told a stranger in Moscow that she disagreed with the war in Ukraine.The woman told the Sunday : aposIt was just a chit chat...he got very upset that we didnapost share his opinion and started arguing, saying that Putin and the war were absolutely right.” The man was thrown out the bar but within an hour police arrived and asked the woman and her friends. While the man was ejected from the bar, within an hour the police had arrived and asked the woman and her friends to go outside. She was tossed in a cell overnight and fined for “discrediting Russian armed forces”, she said.Alongside that, at a school in Penza, central Russia, pupils ratted out their own teacher after they secretly recorded her making anti-war comments..  Other Russians reported on the hotline include a Siberian woman who decorated her tree yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, a man in Moscow who hung a Ukrainian flag from his window, and a police officer who was overheard criticising the invasion. The accounts have been collected by Russian human rights group OVD-Info. Head of the groupaposs legal department Alexandra Baeva said: “In Russia now, it is like : people are scared and informing on each other.” The success of such hotlines come less from the people who are reported to it, than the atmosphere of terror and mistrust it creates among the Russian public On top of that, the Kremlin remains eager to present the country as behind the invasion, despite  people being arrested at  separate anti-war protests on Saturday alone.  Currently, it is illegal to speak out or even show disapproval of the invasion of Ukraine. Even calling it a war is currently outlawed as Putin farcically claimed it was a “special operation”. On March , during one of a number of speeches the Russian President has made, he warned “scum” traitors that loyal Russians would “spit them out like a midge that flew into their mouths”. He spoke of Russian society in terms of purity, echoing sentiment heard in Nazi Germany. Putin said: ”I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge.”Speaking of Russian traitors, he added: “I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera.£Or who canapost get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called aposgender freedoms.aposThe problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia. “The West will try to bet on the so-called fth column, on traitors...to ide our society...to provoke civil confrontation...to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia.” The term ‘fth column’ was previously used by Stalin to described anyone he decided was against his Communist party.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being. But it’s also the process of storytelling: the togetherness it creates, the shared space and attention, the heart-to-heart connection, the stimulation of imagination. Not even the best film on a screen does that.We are all storytellers, but sometimes it is good to be reminded just how important it is to be so, and that includes listening to, as well as telling, stories.As the report concluded: “Stories possess a symbolic dimension that seems to create a natural bridge to the core of our humanity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leading-pig-farmers-plea-cabinet-secretary","story":"Mairi Gougeon MSP was accompanied by county MSP Paul McLennan on the visit to one of several high-health pig farms run by Mr Wyllie.Pig farms across Scotland are all operating at a substantial and growing loss.Mr Wyllie, of Ruchlaw Mains, Stenton, estimates that losses of about £ per pig in February last year have since deepened to more than £ per pig. Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"former-bank-turned-new-home","story":"Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed its branch on North Berwick’s Westgate in .Since then, plans have come forward to convert the site of the single-storey bank hall, which is attached to a Category-B listed building, into a three-storey property, complete with wine cellar and rumpus room in the basement.Those proposals were turned down after meeting a wall of objection from the community, while councillors were keen to see office space remain in the town centre.Despite repeated attempts to secure planning permission and listed building consent, no plans were approved.Now, fresh proposals are with East Lothian Council for the former bank building to be brought back into use.The latest plans, from Patricia Sharp, would see the building remain single-storey.Inside, two bedrooms would be created, alongside a home office store, lounge and dining and kitchen area.A supporting statement included with the latest application notes the prior intention was to demolish the former banking hall and for a new home to be built on the site.Now, the developer is asking East Lothian Council to approve a change of use from a bank to a single flat.The document reads: “It is now well established by the means set out in adopted policy that the former bank has no commercial attraction in the North Berwick market.“It is understood that any replacement building, whether in a modern or traditional mould, would attract opposition from neighbours, from those living in Westgate, and those concerned with the amenity of North Berwick.“In addition, the committee and the LRB [Local Review Body] have made their views clear.“Accordingly, a change of use would preserve the building’s footprint, massing and style, and would send an important signal about the beneficial attractive use of buildings which have fallen out of use or have been abandoned by their commercial occupants.”Christiane Maher, treasurer of North Berwick Community Council, confirmed that the latest plans would be discussed at the group’s next meeting on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-groups-provide-free-taster-sessions-help-boost-covid-recovery","story":"Project , launched by Musselburgh Area Partnership, which distributes a council budget to local schemes, welcomed applications for funding, with a total of £, on offer to community organisations.Iain Clark, area partnership chairman, said: “The pandemic has had a huge effect on all aspects of our lives.

Stephen, an ex-soldier and recovering alcoholic, has just found the daughter he never knew - but fears losing her when he is summoned to an enquiry about his involvement in an incident during The Troubles in Ireland. Unable to face telling her, he writes to her. The result is partly a love letter: for her, for his le at the time she was born, for the country, for le itself - and part confession of his own role in something he struggles to forgive himself for. Andrew Millers gentle, beautully crafted sentences belie the often brutal truths behind the narrative. Memories of lost colleagues and Stephens own childhood sit alongside a darker past. The image of the slowworm, silent and sinister, finding its way into the precious earth, is set against a song of light and le that wont be silenced. Twelve SecretsRobert GoldSphere, £.

Robert Gold - launching his debut Twelve Secrets after spending years as a book buyer feverishly absorbing the product - delivers an intriguing tale of a shocking teenage tragedy that continues to torture investigative journalist Ben Harper, and send shockwaves through the generations of families who live in the fictional village of Haddley.

It is estimated that almost % of UK swts have disappeared over the last  years, the charities warn.Wild About Highflyers, the name of this years Wild About Gardens campaign, urges people to support these charismatic migratory birds and help in countering habitat loss and decline in insect prey.\"Sadly, these birds - like much of our wildle - have suffered severe declines in recent decades due to habitat loss and plummeting insect numbers, which are affected by pollution, the impacts of development, and climate change,\" says Dr Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery at The Wildle Trusts.\"With a bit of ersity and structure, a garden can become a haven for all kinds of wildle, providing nesting sites, shelter and food. Its all about being creative, ditching all chemicals, and letting things go a bit wild.\"If we can encourage enough gardeners to give a bit of their garden over to wildle, it could work wonders for the natural world, which means more insects for swallows and more enjoyment of wildle for people.\"Helen Bostock, senior wildle specialist at the RHS, suggests five ways to support birds in the garden. Gt your birds a box this yearSome birds are happy to select their own accommodation, a robin making a nest in an old pair of gardening boots or a pair of blackbirds hiding their nest in a tangle of stems in a dense shrub.Lots of other birds, though, will be happy to use manmade boxes. These can be a lesavernatural nesting spots are in short supply or human building work means eaves or soffit boards are no longer available for house sparrows or ing migrant birds such as swts.Place the boxes as close as you can to where the original site was. Choose bird box designs to match your space or what species youd like to attract.. Lend a hand with nest liningBirds use a wonderful iety of nesting material. Long-tailed tits, for instance, spend days constructing a tear-dropped globe from thousands of pieces of lichen, moss, grass, wool, hair and feathers. Tolerating some moss in your lawn and hanging up undyed sheeps wool will ensure theres a plentul supply, even in new build gardens.Meanwhile, swallows and house martins use mud, binding it together with pieces of dry grass. Mud isnt always easy to come by, especially in a dry year, so muck in by building a mini bog garden or keeping a muddy edge to the side of your garden pond.. Serve up some insectsPlant an insect-friendly border or meadow flowers such as wild carrot, poppies, yarrow, scabious and bistorts. What youre looking for are flowers with open structures which even the tiniest of flies, wasps and beetles can land on and access the nectar or pollen.Massive declines in insect numbers both in the UK and further afield means there is less fodder for hungry birds. Insectivorous migratory birds such as swallows, house martins and spotted flycatchers need these in abundance. Even seed-eating birds will usually need a plentul supply of caterpillars, aphids and other insects to feed their young.. Make a running water featureSome birds, especially blackbirds, seem particularly drawn to fountains, cascades or dribble fountains - so why not get yourself one of these this summer  They also make a lovely sound and a place to watch birds in their bathing antics. Its good to keep any water feature, used by birds for bathing or drinking, topped up and refreshed regularly with clean water. This will help stop the spread of avian diseases.. Introduce a pet patrolKeep pets, especially cats, indoors when you notice fledglings in the garden. These fluffy, often drabber versions of their parents can be spotted hopping about on or close to the ground. Its easy to mistake this for a chick in need, seemingly abandoned by its parents but this is normal behaviour for many fledglings when first out of the nest and the adults are often nearby.In fact the chicks will cheep quite noisilya free dinner is on its way. Fledgling swts, swallows and house martins are the exception as they can fly from a young age soyou find one of these on the ground or the bird appears injured, call your local wildle rescue for advice.How to identy house martins, swallows and swtsthey visit your gardenHouse martins:House martins have glossy blue-black upper parts and pure white under parts and a distinctive white rump with a forked tail. They spend winters in Africa, but can be seen across the whole of the UK between March and October, dashing between rooftops in towns and villages or near areas of farmland, woodland and water where insects are plentul. They sometimes nest in groups, usually consisting of around five nests.SwallowsSwallows are small birds with dark, glossy-blue backs, dark red forehead and throat, pale underparts and long forked tail. They spend most of their time on the wing. Youll see them here from March to October, often spotted perching on wires in small numbers.SwtsSwts are brown, but in flight against the sky appear black, with long wings and a short forked tail. Again, they are summer visitors, breeding in the UK but spending their winters in Africa.For more information visit wildaboutgardens.org.uk"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13637353.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-home-year-2022-episode-1-highlands","story":"Each has its own quirky and eye-catching style.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

It’s part of ambitious UK Government plans to turbo-charge our national recovery from COVID-. At the centre of this initiative is Jobcentre Plus.Jobcentre Plus has a long and successful track record of matching quality employers with quality candidates. Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors. Jobcentre Plus can quickly put companies in touch with candidates who can make a real dference to their businesses.We talk to employers and employees about how they have benefited from working with Jobcentre Plus. vw, px\"  ‘Working with Jobcentre Plus is a no brainer’: Jordan, Contracts Manager, Elite Scaffolding, YeovilElite Scaffolding – a family-owned business that is part of the Denholm Group, reached out to Jobcentre Plus in a bid to reach younger potential employees looking for an apprenticeship.#We initially approached the jobcentre, simply for advice and to askthey could place an ad on their system. We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

It is better for us.”Attention in east London has now shted to Thursday’s home leg against Ligue  Lyon in West Ham’s first European quarter-final for  years.“As you can imagine it is very exciting for the players and staff but also the people who support West Ham,” added Fornals. “It has been massive. We are going to try and go as far as we can in all competitions because I think every one of us deserves it.“It is unbelievable and I am really happy and proud to be a part of this moment in West Ham history. It is massive for my career and I am really happy to be here.”West Ham’s small squad was stretched to the limit before the international break, but full-backs Vladimir Coufal and Ryan Fredericks are also fit again after spells out injured.“It is very good because we were playing the last two weeks before the last international break with one, maybe one and a half, players for each spot” said Fornals.“That was a bit hard. Now we have Ryan, Vlad and Bowen all back and the other teams now know we have even more players in the team.“I think since we started the season everyone can see how together we are and how important each one in the group is. It doesn’t matter how much you are playing, you have a chance to help the team and that is the main thing.”Aaron Cresswell’s spectacular free-kick put West Ham ahead against Everton and, although Mason Holgate equalised with a deflected effort, Bowen converted the rebound from Michail Antonio’s shot to seal a - win.Defeat left Everton still looking nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone and facing a huge match with fellow strugglers Burnley on Wednesday.“The next game will always be so important,” said manager Frank Lampard. “We can’t even think in blocks of games because the next one is a competitor down in the same area of the table.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4553935.jpg--.jpg?1648651423000\n","title":"wrightbus continues recruitment search with 50 new jobs","story":"WORLD leading bus manufacturer Wrightbus is hosting a recruitment evening on Thursdayas it continues to bolster its ranks with an additional  staff after an increase in orders.The Ballymena-based company is launching the second phase of its recruitment drive ready for an increase in the production schedule after Easter.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast familys 1957 legacy to church now worth","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

The window remains in place today.Ciaran O#NeillApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA church fund set up  years ago in memory of a Northern Ireland couple is now worth almost £m.When Belfast man John Craig died in , he left £, to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in memory of his parents, Frank and Sarah.It was the largest ever donation made to the church and would today be the equivalent of a £.m donation.The church clearly invested the money wisely and the Sunday Independent has learned that the latest valuation of the Craig fund is around £.m.Frank Craig had run a successful drapery business called Frank Craig  Son in Ballymena for many years and also owned several other properties and land in the Co Antrim town.He died in the early s and following his death, his we and their three children, John, Hester and Sophie, moved to live at Windsor Avenue in an affluent area of south Belfast.After relocating to Belfast, the family worshipped at Fisherwick Presbyterian Church which was a short distance from their home.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The  census records show that Mrs Craig was  years-old at that time and lived in the Windsor Avenue house with her three adult children and a servant.Following Mrs Craig’s death a number of years later, the family’s financial assets were inherited by their only son.In , John Craig paid for a large stained-glass window to be installed at Fisherwick Church in memory of his parents. The window remains in place today.Neither Mr Craig nor his sisters ever married, and they are understood to have remained living together at the family home until his death in June , aged in his mid s.A report in the Ballymena Observer newspaper on October , , outlined details of Mr Craig’s will.According to the report, he left a block of five shops at Church Street in Ballymena and other property and land in the town to his two sisters, along with the house in Belfast.He also left £, for the upkeep of the window at Fisherwick Church.The will stated that the remainder of Mr Craig’s estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to set up a fund called the “The Frank McCaughey Craig and Sarah Remington Charles Trust” in honour of his parents.Mr Craig requested that the fund be used to augment the “salary and stipend of clergymen who are not paid the minimum of £ a year”.However, he stressed that this was not to include “assistants or retired ministers”.The newspaper report added: “An official at Church House, Belfast, said that they had known for some time that a substantial bequest was likely. Final details were not yet available, but it was estimated that, after several bequests and other questions had been settled, the sum would be around £,.”Tragically, according to the newspaper report, Hester Craig died a few days after her brother. It is believed she was around  years-old.As a result of her death, all of the family’s assets were inherited by Sophie Craig.However, Ms Craig did not live for much longer after the deaths of her siblings. She died in February , at the age of .Deaths notices which appeared in the following day’s Newsletter and Belfast  newspapers provided very little information about Ms Craig or her family.The notices simply stated she had died at her residence at Windsor Avenue and that the house and funeral were “private”.The details of her will were subsequently published in the Belfast Gazette a couple of months later in May .The notice states the will was originally written on May ,  before alterations were made on January , , and February , , just three days before Ms Craig passed away.In her will, the Belfast woman asked that £, be bequeathed to Fisherwick Presbyterian Church for the upkeep of the window in memory of her parents, as well as for the “interior decoration” of the church.The will stated that the rest of her estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to be added to the fund set up a few years earlier as a result of her brother’s bequest.When contacted by the Sunday Independent last week, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland was unable to say how much was added to the fund following Ms Craig’s death.A spokesperson for the church was also unable to provide the current value of the fund.However, the church’s latest publicly available accounts show that the Craig trust fund was valued at £,, on December , . That year the Presbyterian Church received a idend of £, from the fund.The continued growth of the fund in recent years is evident from the church’s  accounts which show that on December , , it was valued at £,,. The church received a idend of £, from the Craig fund in .The money generated by the fund continues to be used by the Presbyterian Church to supplement the salaries of its ministers.A spokesperson for Fisherwick Presbyterian Church said they were aware of a fund having been set up to provide for the upkeep of the prominent stained-glass window in the church.However, he added that very little was known about the origins of the fund.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls Latest Northern IrelandUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your vote smart ways to save or generate money amid the ongoing cost of living crisisRonan Sheehan rues missed chances as Down fail in mission to make the big timeSinn Fein widens gap on DUP in race to be Stormont’s largest party – pollLatestTrevor Bayliss named London Spirit head coach after Shane Warne’s deathElon Musk buys .% stake in TwitterSales beat expectations at Franco Manca owner after virus curbs easePablo Fornals believes Jarrod Bowen’sis ‘massive’ for West HamMatt Doherty never considered quitting Spurs despite lack of game time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDisagreeing with another view not the same as censorship Premium‘Massive anger’ from nationalists at Stormont’s failure, says Aontu leader PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionWhen a prospective MLA knocks on your front door, you’re holding more power than themThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteDUP and Sinn Fein trade claims over election prioritiesElection candidates must commit to action on animal welfare, charity saysSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPLatestEarnings gap between men and women graduates grows to  euro per weekTrevor Bayliss named London Spirit head coach after Shane Warne’s deathElon Musk buys .% stake in TwitterSales beat expectations at Franco Manca owner after virus curbs easePablo Fornals believes Jarrod Bowen’sis ‘massive’ for West Ham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryAmy CochraneTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailElection posters are on almost every lamppost on every corner of our towns and cities ahead of the big vote.Faces of the men and women hoping to take a seat at Stormont after May  stare down at us almost everywhere we go.But how effective are these posters as a form of advertising for would-be MLAs Some have argued they are a great way of showcasing the names and faces of candidates entering the election race, but others fear they are old-fashioned, crude and bad for the environment, with some placards also being stolen and placed on bonfires.Realistically, the only way to banish posters altogether isevery party agrees, but in Northern Ireland, consensus is a hard thing to achieve.According to PR expert Tom Kelly, posters and billboards are better at selling ideas here than in England, parts which have moved to more digital forms of canvassing.Mr Kelly, who has worked in PR for  years but also dabbled in politics as the former vice-chairman of the SDLP, told the Belfastposters could be a powerful advertising tool, even beyond facial and name recognition.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There is a certain physical aspect to a poster or a billboard compared to just seeing the candidates’ faces on social media,” he said.“Not everyone can get to every constituent’s door, so [posters] a good way to get your face out there.“There’s also an element of competition between candidates where you may go to an area to canvas and you see your opponent’s name and face. “It makes you uneasy, and candidates really do get obsessed about how many posters they have up compared to others, so you’d be a brave man or woman to decide not to put them up. In reality, I would like to see none, but we aren’t quite there yet.”Mr Kelly used the Brexit referendum as an example of canvassing where posters and billboards influenced an outcome.“I remember crossing England in  and seeing the big Leave campaign billboard on the motorway from Manchester to Leeds,” he said. “You couldn’t not see it, and you started to notice they had a real presence.“Everyone remembers the big red bus that promised £m a week for the NHS. It may have been a lie, but it worked.“The Remain campaign, however, ignored those traditional forms of canvassing and instead focused solely on digital, whereas Leave did a bit of both.”While the PR expert sees merit in posters, they must be strategically placed.“I think most people would not want posters in their back yard but instead on main arterial routes in and out of towns and cities,” he said. “They could be a bit more effective in these areas, so as not to swamp residential areas.“For urban areas, billboards can be really effective, or a bus, whereas posters work better in rural areas.”Former Alliance party executive director Gerry Lynch believes that the colour, typeface and font of a poster can also have an impact.Mr Lynch, who was heavily involved in poster design and campaign tactics throughout his time in politics, explained: “Graphic designers have a very important job in elections that many don’t know.“Generally, Sinn Fein and Alliance would have the name of the party more prominent in the poster, and in some cases use posters with slogan words only and no photograph.“Unionist parties focus more on colour — reds and blues, which project strength — where they compete on which candidate can deliver the strongest for unionist interests.“It can come down to so many small details, even the fringing or shadowing on the image. “Graphic designers are able to express visual identity in a way most people don’t know. Even voters don’t know.”Mr Lynch, who was involved in the Alliance party for  years but is now a CoE priest based in England, said that in some areas across the water, particularly in southern counties, councils did not allow election posters in public spaces, with the tradition dying out over the years.“It’s a bit of a mix of digital canvassing and door-to-door, finding out where their supporters are and stopping voters from wavering to opponents,” he added.“While I don’t think posters with people’s heads on them make much of a dference on the campaign trail, Northern Ireland isn’t quite at the point yet where they can stop.“It requires everyone to stop — and everyone to agree.“I think a physical presence still matters, and the most impactful poster is one that resembles one of an advertising agency, more leaning towards a slogan than someone’s face.”The SDLP’s Colin McGrath has been involved in politics for almost two decades, being elected to his local council in  and becoming an MLA in . Next month’s election will be his sixth, and he believes that all posters should be banned.“They can be unsightly and many people don’t want to see them,” he said.“They’re also terrible for the environment, a waste of cardboard and plastic ties, but there is unfortunately an element of competition, which is the main motivator.“You see who has the most up where, and as soon as one puts theirs up, the others are at a disadvantage.“It can become white noise after a period of time, butyou’re a first-time candidate, you want to be part of the white noise everyone  is a part of. For things to change, it would need legislation.”Mr McGrath said posters mainly benefited new candidates but added that local media often played a bigger role.“Nine times out of , people say they recognise me from the local papers — the Mourne Observer or the Down Recorder — or sometimes social media and TV,” he explained. “Rarely do you win the election in the four or five weeks leading up to it. “People get to know you over the better part of a year or more.”TUV leader Jim Allister, however, believes that posters are “very much part of the fabric of an election”.The upcoming election will be Mr Allister’s fourth, after first being elected into the Assembly in .“Posters do serve a purpose, I believe, and an educational purpose as it shows voters who the relevant candidates are,” he told this newspaper.“They can also be a bit of a morale booster, in a sense, for each respective party.“They are very much part of the scenery of elections in Northern Ireland, and traditionally it has always happened.“There are occasions where you may see too many, but I don’t think that anyone here is going to give up on posters anytime soon.”Related topicsSDLPAlliance PartyJim AllisterSinn FéinColin McGrathTraditional Unionist VoiceMore On SDLP Premium‘Massive anger’ from nationalists at Stormont’s failure, says Aontu leader PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDisagreeing with another view not the same as censorship PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slursAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionWhen a prospective MLA knocks on your front door, you’re holding more power than themThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteDUP and Sinn Fein trade claims over election prioritiesElection candidates must commit to action on animal welfare, charity saysSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPLatestWill your local bus service benefit from extra funding Earnings gap between men and women graduates grows to  euro per weekTrevor Bayliss named London Spirit head coach after Shane Warne’s deathElon Musk buys .% stake in TwitterSales beat expectations at Franco Manca owner after virus curbs ease,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many people would prefer the salesman, but in fact this is a moment where voters hold more power than politicians.Knowing a little bit about how political parties approach canvassing and what they are hoping to achieve can help you to play the system to your advantage — and also help the politicians, eventhat involves the discomfort of hearing your disobliging comments about themselves or their party.Despite all the sophistication of modern politics, knocking doors to persuade a voter to back one candidate over another is still a key element of political success.Two decades ago, a US study by Alan S Gerber and Donald P Green at Yale University found that in a randomised field experiment of , voters in Connecticut voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls.They hypothesised that falling electoral turnout was linked to a decline in face-to-face campaigning. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteMuch has changed since then. Social media is now the sexiest tool for political parties and allows those with money to get ultra-targeted messages advertised on the screens of the voters they need — a particular benefit for parties struggling to attract dedicated campaigners to tramp streets.But some people — particularly some elderly voters — still value a personal knock on the door, believing thata candidate wants their vote enough they should come and ask for it.However, canvassing is not just one-way traffic.Yes, the canvasser is trying to sell their candidate to you — but they are also harvesting information.It might seem rude when they askyou would vote for their party, but that is part of a vast data-harvesting operation to identy likely voters whose names will be entered in their database .Depending on how likely you say you are to vote, you may be targeted again closer to the election or on polling day as the party moves to its ‘get out the vote’ operation.But they are not just taking in your answer to that one question they are hearing — or should be — what you are saying about other things your reasons for liking their party, your reasons for disliking it, your priorities, the things you think their party has misunderstood about people like you, or whatever it might be that you say.If large numbers of people are saying similar things to a party’s canvassers, the message is taken seriously by any competent party. This is a form of mass polling, and while politicians may say they don’t believe the polls when they deliver unwelcome news, they believe it when they hear it first hand or through colleagues. This is the most nervous time for a politician — especially for one in a party which is losing support.And yet few voters realise that this is the time when their power is greatest. Voters hold in their hands not only the careers of inidual MLAs, but the fates of parties.A veteran of canvassing in Northern Ireland said that % of people “want you off their door as quickly as possible”, and few say much about how they will vote. But that works in favour of those who do engage —you are part of the % who express your views, they will be seen as far more representative than in fact they may be, because so many other people declined to engage.However you engage with canvassers, be respectful — even to those from parties which you may detest. This is about more than basic good manners democracy can only candidates who profoundly disagree with each other put their names forward for election.Whatever you think about the candidates, it takes courage to put yourself up for what is a form of public popularity contest where the result is announced live on TV. It can be humiliating, and involves its own form of bravery.Many of the canvassers will not be politicians, will not be paid, and may not even be members of the party they are advertising.Today we bring you ten questions you can ask those knocking your door to both get across your views and tease out whether they are worthy of your vote.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election The  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteDUP and Sinn Fein trade claims over election prioritiesElection candidates must commit to action on animal welfare, charity saysSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueLatestTrevor Bayliss named London Spirit head coach after Shane Warne’s deathElon Musk buys .% stake in TwitterSales beat expectations at Franco Manca owner after virus curbs easePablo Fornals believes Jarrod Bowen’sis ‘massive’ for West HamMatt Doherty never considered quitting Spurs despite lack of game time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cook Islands flag, a Civil Guard source said, and is valued at around £. million according to superyachtfan, a specialised website tracking the world’s largest and most exclusive recreational boats.The yacht is among the assets linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of Mr Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate encompassing metals, mining, tech and other assets, according to US Treasury Department documents.Mr Vekselberg’s assets in the US are frozen and US companies are forbidden from doing business with him and his entities.The move is the first time the US government has seized an oligarch’s yacht since attorney general Merrick Garland and Treasury secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as Repo — short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs — in an effort to enforce sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.Mr Vekselberg has long had ties to the US, including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut.The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminium and oil industries in the post-Soviet era.Mr Vekselberg was also questioned during an investigation into Russian interference in the  US presidential election and has worked closely with his American cousin, Andrew Intrater, who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova.Mr Vekselberg and Mr Intrater were thrust into the spotlight during the election probe after a lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels released a memo claiming ,in hush money was routed through

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the

teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk

environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularIn Pictures - The official opening of the Royal Black Institution state-of-the-art headquarters in LoughgallOwen Polley: Beattie’s unfortunate message to voters appalled by sea borderAttack on Northern Ireland war memorial: given war in Ukraine, people should have more respectRevealed: the  UUP candidates on a mission to deliver fresh leadershipThese are the Easyjet flights cancelled to Northern Ireland today as Covid infections hit staff numbersMost PopularBest men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK : walking trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, Montane, SalomonWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBeautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses. It’s not too late to get protected.”Patricia was a clinical psychologist by profession and held a number of key positions at Trust level before retiring.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Provision of Covid tests by government are changing.However free testing will persist in NI for some time yet subject, to some changes. Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is better for us.”Attention in east London has now shted to Thursday’s home leg against Ligue  Lyon in West Ham’s first European quarter-final for  years.“As you can imagine it is very exciting for the players and staff but also the people who support West Ham,” added Fornals. “It has been massive. We are going to try and go as far as we can in all competitions because I think every one of us deserves it.“It is unbelievable and I am really happy and proud to be a part of this moment in West Ham history. It is massive for my career and I am really happy to be here.”West Ham’s small squad was stretched to the limit before the international break, but full-backs Vladimir Coufal and Ryan Fredericks are also fit again after spells out injured.“It is very good because we were playing the last two weeks before the last international break with one, maybe one and a half, players for each spot” said Fornals.“That was a bit hard. Now we have Ryan, Vlad and Bowen all back and the other teams now know we have even more players in the team.“I think since we started the season everyone can see how together we are and how important each one in the group is. It doesn’t matter how much you are playing, you have a chance to help the team and that is the main thing.”Aaron Cresswell’s spectacular free-kick put West Ham ahead against Everton and, although Mason Holgate equalised with a deflected effort, Bowen converted the rebound from Michail Antonio’s shot to seal a - win..removeDefeat left Everton still looking nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone and facing a huge match with fellow strugglers Burnley on Wednesday.“The next game will always be so important,” said manager Frank Lampard. “We can’t even think in blocks of games because the next one is a competitor down in the same area of the table.

Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Wilson opens the ‘Prelude’ to his  biography ‘Charles Darwin Victorian mythmaker’. Wilson, be it noted, is no religious fundamentalist one of his earlier books is entitled, ‘God’s funeral’, detailing the th century drt from religious belief. Whether he justies his daring opening statement is for better minds than mine to determine, but he does point out the ways in which Darwin was influenced by others, and how he revised his views in the light of contemporary criticism.The facts of Darwin’s le are well known. Born into a well-to-do family, he had leisure and money enough to indulge his interests. After education at Edinburgh and Cambridge he became the on-board naturalist on ‘The Beagle’, a ship engaged in a five-year circumnavigation of the world, for mapping and other scientic purposes. If genius be adequately defined as ‘an infinite capacity for taking pains’ then Darwin was a genius, bringing back thousands of specimens for Britain’s museums.Thereafter he led a rather reclusive le, pursuing his experiments and refining his theories. They found their way into print in his explosive book, ‘The Origin of species’, in , making such concepts as ‘evolution’ and ‘the survival of the fittest’ part of everyday parlance. The latter phrase, coincidentally, was coined, not by Darwin but by the philosopher Herbert Spencer.Wilson argues that the idea which Darwin propagated shamelessly as ‘my theory’, owed an immense amount to others, even his own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin. Indeed, a year before the publication of his famous book, he received a manuscript from the naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace, containing a theory of the origin of species identical with his own.That his book caused consternation in religious circles was almost inevitable, although both then and now many reputable scientists see no necessary contradiction between Darwin’s theories and the biblical faith.Darwin was discreet about his own religious views, perhaps out of consideration for his we, a sincere believer in the low-church tradition.His scientic obsessions meant that other interests were crowded out. At University he loved music so much that he hired choristers to sing in his rooms, yet as an old man he lamented, ‘it is a mystery how I could possibly have derived pleasure from music’. Most tragically of all, when he was dying he became aware that he had never lived for others, and his granddaughter Gwen Raverat noted that the poor did not really exist for him.Christ’s parable of the rich man and Lazarus underlines our need to care for the poor around us . Even the sceptical novelist George Eliot observed, ‘What do we live forit is not to make le less dficult for each other’.Was Darwin a great scientist  Undoubtedly, as a tomb in Westminster Abbey confirms. Was he a fully-rounded human being  Probably not.Read More Read MoreReligion: politeness or enthusiasmJohn DarwinITV  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularMurder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriage...NewsHeading to the north coast this weekend  Police issue advice...NewsEntertainer William Caulfield banned for driving up to an es...News Larne band named after murdered policeman holds first annual...NewsMan stopped on NI road arrested in connection with Milton Ke...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"action for children benefit by almost ps from valentines charity ball ","story":"Sports clubs across NI pay tribute to Co Armagh man John Cochrane, a founding father of Craigavon City FC   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleAction for Children benefit by almost £, from Valentines charity ballAfter a turbulent couple of years for the events industry and Charities, Ballyscullion Park’s glittering Valentine’s Charity Ball raised an incredible £, supporting local children, young people and their families in Northern Ireland.By Stanley CampbellMonday, th April , : pmUpdated Monday, th April , : pm  \"       \"  The Bellaghy wedding venue were blown away by the huge success and local support from all the guests on the evening.Ballyscullion social media and marketing manager, Cordelia McKinley said: \"For our second Ballyscullion Park Valentines Charity Ball we decided to raise vital funds for childrenAs charity Action for Children.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedeeabeebdbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edaeadbababd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
