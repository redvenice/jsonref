He allegedly fathered a son with his aide Dr Henrietta Morton-King 20 months ago after an affair while she worked in his Westminster office in 2015She lives with her parents near Hastings, about 20 miles from Mr Merriman’s family home, and works at a beauty salon providing Botox-style treatments. A source told The Sun:  ‘Huw and Hetty started the affair while she was working as his assistant and it carried on after she moved to finish her medical training at Conquest Hospital, near Hastings.‘She later gave birth at the same hospital.’ The source added: ‘The relationship with Hetty is now over. Huw has stayed with his wife who is fully aware of the situation.’ Dr Morton-King, whose friends and family call her Hetty, went to the University of Bristol where she studied medicine.She then specialised in aesthetic medicine at North Cumbria University Hospitals and on Harley Street in London, which is renowned for its cosmetic surgery clinics.Dr Morton-King then took a career break and worked in her local MP Huw Merriman\u0027s office.It is believed that she then transferred to Conquest Hospital, Hastings, to continue her medical training after falling pregnant, and also had her son there.A year after his birth she joined the \u0027Beauty Barn\u0027 in Battle, where she offers dermal fillers and wrinkle relaxing using Botox just three miles from the home she shares with her parents. The affair is said to have begun shortly after Mr Merriman was elected to Parliament in May 2015. Dr Morton-King gave birth in October 2016.Mr Merriman, a former barrister at collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers, married in 2001. A friend said: ‘There is no hostility towards Huw from Hetty or her family. They understand his place is with his wife and family.’   The married Tory, 44, (pictured left) was previously accused of telling solicitor colleague Patronia Campbell (right) he wanted to marry her after an alleged one night standLast night, Mrs Merriman declined to comment and her husband was unavailable. In 2016, Mr Merriman was accused by an ex-Lehman Brothers colleague of harassment.          Pattie Campbell told a tribunal Mr Merriman was a notorious womaniser who\u0027s had a string of affairsLawyer Patronia Campbell told a tribunal they had spent the night together in 2011.She claimed he told her he was ‘turned on’ by her legs and wanted to marry her. She later dropped her £250,000 claim against the MP.Mr Merriman always denied the one night stand took place. One witness said they saw him looking \u0027sheepish\u0027 in his pants the morning after, the tribunal heard.Describing the one night stand Ms Campbell told the East London tribunal in 2016: \u0027Huw and I cooked and drank more wine.\u0027He kissed me after dinner and we ended up in my bed and had sex.\u0027I woke up in his arms he asked me if I was OK and I said yes but that it would never happen again.\u0027According to Ms Campbell, the only person she told about the one night stand was her sister, but did reveal her house mate would have known Mr Merriman had slept in her bed.Ms Campbell told the tribunal their previous relationship in the late 1990s was not sexual and she ended it because Mr Merriman had a girlfriend in New York, who later became his wife.Following a Christmas lunch at The Gun pub in 2012 Mr Merriman \u0027insinuated\u0027 he wanted a sexual relationship, she told the tribunal.Ms Campbell, who claimed Mr Merriman was a notorious womaniser who\u0027s had a string of affairs, said he wanted to marry her after a Christmas lunch in 2012.Ms Campbell was made redundant in 2014, which she claimed was unfair. She later dropped her her £250,000 damages claim. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/12/4DA5C1F200000578-5885237-image-a-48_1530012137629.jpg","title":"Britains defence spending increase 50","story":"    Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Houghton (file image) said health spending was good for winning votes but not for defending Britain\u0027s place in the world order          Just six Nato members meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, with Britain (marked red) scraping over the line in 2017 with 2.14 per centLord Houghton told the BBC Radio 4 Today progamme \u0027it would be a great shame\u0027 if the armed forces budget was used as part of a \u0027political game\u0027.He said the current defence plans, set out in 2015 under David Cameron, were \u0027unaffordable\u0027 and the UK needed to \u0027make a decision\u0027 about \u0027what sort of country we aspire to be\u0027.Chancellor\u0027s Budget could be voted down by rebel Tories if...Half of the clothes and shoes bought online are returned...Share this articleLord Houghton said: \u0027The first duty of government is the protection of the nation.\u0027We have slightly deluded the public of late that we have a defence programme that frankly we know is unaffordable.\u0027We are to an extent living a lie.\u0027He added: \u0027More funding for health can win you tactical advantage in elections, but don’t enhance Britain’s standing in the world.\u0027           The row over how much money is spent on different priorities is underpinned by health already taking up 19 per cent of spending compared to 6 per cent on defence The defence committee said military expenditure, currently around 2 per cent of national income, must also rise for the UK to maintain its influence in Nato, they said.The MPs reiterated calls for spending to go up to 3 per cent of GDP – which would be equivalent to an extra £20billion a year.Without this, UK forces would struggle to maintain their ability to work alongside the US military, diminishing their usefulness as allies, the Commons defence select committee said.

His portrait of a place and a time is without equal in modern photography“I didn’t regard the camera as a weapon in the liberation struggle,” the veteran South African photographer David Goldblatt once said. He described his approach, instead, as a dialogue “between myself and whatever I photographed and my compatriots”. That dialogue began 60 years ago, when the teenage Goldblatt began to photograph miners and the landscape of gold-mining in and around Randfontein, the whites-only town where he was born, and ended a few days ago with his death, at the age of 87. In between, he created a body of work that is without precedent in postwar photography.As his recent retrospective at the Pompidou in Paris made clear, South Africa was Goldblatt’s sole subject and his life’s work. I can think of no other photographer who has left behind such a deeply resonant expression of a country’s complex identity. For most of his working life, Goldblatt created a stark, but subtle depiction of the abnormality of apartheid without ever allowing his own anger at the injustices he witnessed to surface in his work. Instead, his detached documentarian’s eye captured the everyday experiences of ordinary people caught up in a landscape determined, like everything else in South Africa, by race laws created to reinforce and perpetuate white rule.One of his earliest series, made while he was still a teenager, documented the lives of black workers in the country’s gold-mining areas. The industry defined the environment he grew up in and, by the time he had become a professional photographer in the 60s, it defined white South Africa’s wealth, too, with nearly half the world’s gold being produced there. That wealth made the apartheid system, under which the black miners’ lives were controlled and devalued, even more grotesque.In 1973, he published On the Mines, which included an essay by Nadine Gordimer, who he later said had influenced his work more than any photographic predecessor. It was the first of several starkly evocative, black and white photobooks made by Goldblatt. In his commercial work, Goldblatt was not averse to shooting in colour, but photographically at least he saw South Africa in black and white. “During those years,” he said, “colour seemed too sweet a medium to express the anger, disgust and fear that apartheid inspired.” The monochrome tones and meticulous compositions of his landscapes and portraits emphasise not just his formal detachment, but his abiding sense of psychological isolation. His parents were Jewish leftwingers who had fled religious persecution in Lithuania, their experience surely informing his work. He famously described himself as “a self-appointed observer and critic of the society into which I was born”.Wandering through that recent retrospective of his work was to see it unfold with a cumulative power that instilled a sense of almost devotional quietude. Goldblatt had a keen eye for symbolic objects: a stacked arrangement of miners’ shovels in a salvage yard, shelves full of canned goods in a shop in Soweto. I was struck, too, by the austere poetry of his images. It is a language of suggestion, of atmosphere, of small but telling details: the craggy, unreadable faces of many of the older white Afrikaners the stern, almost imperial look of those three young white landowners on horseback the languorous but defiant gaze of the young, black, female shop assistant, born into a system where oppression and humiliation was a given. Goldblatt photographed them all with equal attentiveness, his detached but democratic eye allowing the viewer the space to see beyond the frame and sense the grotesque – but normalised – society that defined his subjects to such a degree.As a boy, Goldblatt had worked as a shop assistant in his father’s clothing store, where the customers were Afrikaners. He described them in years later as “austere, upright, unaffected people” who nevertheless supported the ruling National Party and its apartheid policy. “I had great difficulty,” he recalled, “in getting my head and heart around these contradictions.” That conflict is there, too, in his work, but one always sensed where his sympathies lay. In his portraits of his fellow white South Africans, there is a sense of a society in stasis, unchanging and doggedly resistant to the inevitable sweep of history and the increasingly clamorous global protests that apartheid provoked.When everything changed swiftly and dramatically in the wake of Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, Goldblatt continued photographing the world around him with critical fascination. He made contact with ex-prisoners who had served time for often violent assaults, recorded their own stories of survival and photographed them at the scenes of their crimes. It was an attempt to understand life in post-apartheid South Africa where, he said, the values “are not the same values that Mandela stood up for they are greed and self-congratulation”.It is for his images of apartheid-era South Africa, though, that he will be remembered, not least because their quiet observational power and moments of arresting drama – a 15-year-old boy staring straight into the camera, both arms encased in plaster following his arrest and detention by security forces – add up to an extended portrait of a place and a time that is without equal in modern photography.He was, above all, a master of the extended series, each building on the last until a portrait of an entire society, in all its contradictions, emerges. “I would look at Edward Weston’s work,” he said, “and envy the freedom to be lyrical … to photograph a landscape apparently without concern for the implications of its possession.” Those implications, though, are at the very core of photography, and he made us aware of them again and again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7aec900127a4185f0969e2230b8615cfcc3f7d1/0_0_2100_1655/master/2100.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3de72a3739be86a72c1bebeab71ca155 1400w","title":"i grew up with a mother behind bars but her innocence wasnt the only lie i was sold","story":"Australia has become a country defined by its love of locking people up and we see the most vulnerable in our society as a threat In a lecture hall at the University of Queensland, a woman in acid-wash jeans and cowboy boots sits with her legs apart addressing a rapt audience. She speaks in gritty tones that tell of a working-class childhood and a late education. Debbie Kilroy is the founder of Sisters Inside, an advocacy group for incarcerated women. She pulls no punches. Prison is big business. We must shut down the prison-industrial complex.I first learned of Sisters Inside when I was studying law. I had picked up a brochure about the latest Is Prison Obsolete? conference, which was to be held in Melbourne. I showed it to my mother. “Women who’ve been in prison can attend for free.” She registered immediately. It had been several years since she had been released after her final stint. She was living in Brunswick, studying a PhD in literature and nagging me to start dressing properly. We spent a memorable three days listening to prison abolitionists from around the world talking about injustices inflicted on women in custody. At 22 I was dimly aware that the issues being discussed both did and did not align with what she had represented to me as a child. Throughout the decade my mother had spent in and out of custody for a suite of dishonesty offences, she had maintained her innocence. It was a cliche to which I was oblivious. Even once I entered law school, I had still to be disabused of my belief in her. As Red tells Andy in The Shawshank Redemption: “Everyone in here’s innocent.”It was in 2009 that I first visited a prison as a lawyer. I was 26 and a junior solicitor at the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, the Aboriginal legal service in the Northern Territory. The visitors’ centre at Berrimah was outdoors, covered by a tin roof, with open sides through which you could see the prison wall. Two white officers supervised the mostly black inmates seated at the wooden tables with their families or their lawyers.When I pushed open the heavy metal gate, I was flooded with memories of a long-ago prison visit, the first time my mother was held on remand. I had cried myself to sleep on a mattress on my cousin’s floor. My aunt drove me to the prison on Saturday and we stood beside the menacing prison wall until someone answered our buzz at the intercom. I saw my mother through the fence before they hauled the door open for me to run through and hug her. Her prison tracksuit felt strange against my face. I fought these memories off while I talked to my client at Berrimah. Fairlea women’s prison closed in 1996 as sections of the prison system were privatised. Unbeknown to my nine-year-old self, standing in the lee of its wall on that Saturday morning in 1991, Australia was poised to embark on a project of relentless penal expansionism. The ethical problems with private prisons are obvious. Companies profiting from mass punishment their continuing growth and profit potential becoming important to the economy. They also give rise to an apparent conflict of interest. The goal of prison, in theory, is to rehabilitate. When a company’s continued operation demands a robust prison population, there is no incentive to foster conditions that promote staying out of jail post-release. What’s more, with private prisons comes reduced accountability in a sector where accountability has been sorely lacking. It is very difficult to obtain records from a private prison through freedom of information, meaning that deaths in custody cannot be fully investigated for possible breaches of duty of care. For this reason, when the Ngaanyatjarra elder Mr Ward died in the back of a prison transport vehicle going through the Western Australian desert in 2008, records relating to what contractor Global Solutions Ltd knew about the faulty airconditioning in the vehicle could not be accessed. When I was very young, I accompanied my mother to court in Melbourne. She sat primly beside me, neatly dressed, legs crossed. I squeezed her hand and tried to put my arm around her shoulders, but she shrugged me off. The wait was interminable and each minute brought a new layer of dread. She had been to jail before she might be going again. She was an innocent woman, so I thought, being persecuted by the system. Her solicitor sat at the front of the court, laughing and talking with the other young lawyers. I couldn’t hold my mother’s hand tightly enough. “Why isn’t she sitting with you?” I asked, indicating the solicitor, whose insouciance I found offensive. “How can they be laughing like that?” Though I had a lot of the details wrong, my sense of injustice at the casual way people were deprived of their liberty has been vindicated. More than two decades later, we have become a country defined by our love of locking people up. It’s no coincidence that during the same years the penal system has massively expanded in Australia, immigration detention has also become a booming industry. We view the most vulnerable as a threat, whether their desperation manifests in ways that society has criminalised, or by trying to reach our shores to seek asylum. Either way, companies like Serco and G4S stand to gain. Criminal law posits imprisonment in the interests of general deterrence, specific deterrence and rehabilitation. At criminal law conferences, many judges and magistrates openly acknowledge that general deterrence is a fiction and that prison doesn’t rehabilitate. There is talk of justice reinvestment, the practice of redirecting funds that would be used to incarcerate people back into the communities they come from to create infrastructure, jobs and support programs, addressing the factors that led them to offend. In some communities, like Bourke in New South Wales, justice reinvestment programs are being trialled, but public pressure remains for governments to be “tough on crime”.From the modest stage in the lecture theatre at the University of Queensland, Debbie Kilroy matter-of-factly describes the strip-searches female prisoners must go through before they receive visitors. Before and after the visit they must undress, lift their breasts, part their cheeks and, if they are menstruating, take their tampon out. There is obvious discomfort among the audience at these words. Most women in prison have been the victims of sexual abuse. Many women opt to forgo seeing their family, or choose to speak to them in a room ided by a glass partition, rather than go through the searches.As I listen I recall train trips out to Laverton and the shuttle bus to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre to see my mother as a teenager. The strip searches didn’t particularly bother her, she used to say, but they were terrible for women who had been through trauma. I realise I’d never thought to ask if one weekend suited her better than another. Sometimes I turned up unexpectedly. “I wasn’t expecting to see you today,” she always said. “What a nice surprise.” She once told me how she and her drug smuggler mate had tried to calculate how much money was made from the criminal justice system. Big business, they had concluded.I’m 34 now, and have only recently pieced together my childhood. It has taken years to fully understand that my mother’s claim of having been “set up” by the police was what people in the territory call “gammon” – bullshit. When I first heard Kilroy speak at the conference in Melbourne, I still believed my mother innocent. At the end of the conference, Kilroy had invited all the women in the audience who had been “inside” to rise to their feet. Women throughout the hall had stood stiffly and those remaining seated looked at them with something like admiration. My mother had left at lunchtime that day. If she had been there to rise to her feet, what would she have felt towards the daughter who had brought her along, her head still full of her mother’s lies?It has been some time since we have spoken. I just want you to admit what really happened, I had told her. This time, I’m here alone. To one side of me two heavily pierced women listen intently. In front of me sit several earnest-looking undergraduates. A few people stand up to leave. Kilroy picks up the microphone one last time.

The president refused to exempt the European Union (including the UK), Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminium tariffs on imports from outside the US, while threatening $200bn (£151m) of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The news rocked global stock markets as investors grow increasingly concerned over the actions, with the FTSE 100 losing more than 100 points in the past few weeks. Falling exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft contributed to Britain’s trade in goods deficit unexpectedly ballooning by £2bn to £14bn in April from the month earlier. Economists had forecast the gap between what Britain imports from the rest of the world and sells overseas would shrink slightly. Taking into account trade in UK services, as well as goods, over the three months to April, the total trade deficit widened by £1.9bn to £9.7bn. The UK’s dominant services sector expanded more quickly than expected in May, according to the most recent data published over the course of the last month, in a sign that Britain could have come through the worst of this year’s slowdown. The latest snapshot from the IHS MarkitCips UK Services PMI showed activity in the sector, which includes banks, restaurants and hotels, recovering to a three-month high. The construction and manufacturing sectors also recorded stronger-than-expected growth. Tax rises might be around the corner to fund Theresa May’s pledge to increase NHS spending by £20bn a year by 2024, yet the latest figures from the UK public finances show public sector borrowing falling further than expected. The budget deficit – the gap between income from tax and government spending – fell to £5bn in May from £7bn in the same month a year ago, beating economists’ forecasts. There was also a revision for the 2017-18 financial year by the Office for National Statistics, showing borrowing came in £1bn lower than previously thought.

That it comes in the wake of Airbus’s warning that 6,000 jobs at its Broughton factory in Flintshire are being put at risk by continuing uncertainty over Brexit, and on the same day that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders sounded the alarm over the future of car building in the UK, only serves to increase the pain. Ford employs 1,700 people at its Bridgend plant, while a new Aston Martin factory is due to open in south Wales next year. The tidal lagoon project, had it gone ahead, was expected to create 2,200 jobs, plus more in the supply chain. These are the kinds of jobs that Wales, so damaged by steel and coal closures, needs. But the business secretary, Greg Clark, has decided the country can’t have them because they would be too expensive.It’s true that tidal lagoon power is costly at the moment. The so-called strike price that the government would have to agree for Swansea’s electricity, to get the project off the ground, lay between £92.70 and £150 per megawatt hour (MWh), with the difference accounted for by a Welsh government subsidy, and the duration of the contract. While the UK government’s rejection of the scheme – on which the company says it has spent £35m – was based on the higher figure of £150 over 30 years, the company said that, given a longer contract of 60 years, it could supply electricity at £92.70, the same as Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, the government’s flagship energy project in Somerset (Hinkley Point’s strike price is fixed for 35 years). The Welsh government said that its offer of a £200m subsidy made the Swansea project – meant to be the first of six British tidal lagoons, four of them in Wales – competitive with Hinkley even on a similar time . Welsh politicians have reacted with understandable fury to Mr Clark’s announcement, which comes almost exactly 12 months after the government abandoned plans to electrify the railway from Cardiff to Swansea, and just a day after MPs voted to press ahead with another expensive infrastructure project: a third runway at Heathrow.There are some rational reasons to approve of this week’s decision, while regretting its consequences. No one, including the Tidal Lagoon Power company, denied that the electricity produced off the Welsh coast would have cost more than the cheapest renewables. The most recent government auctions saw offshore wind schemes win contracts at record lows of £57.50 per megawatt hour, meaning they are within a few pounds of being subsidy-free. But cost is not the only consideration. Otherwise, the government would never have gone ahead with the hugely expensive, risky and uncertain Hinkley\u0026nbspPoint\u0026nbspC. Nor would it have cut subsidies for solar power and onshore wind, as it did in 2015. Those decisions – particularly the promise to curb onshore wind, as the Conservatives did in their 2015 manifesto, despite poll after poll showing that a majority of the public prefers wind and solar to nuclear – were ideological.In a City speech this March, Mr Clark praised business for putting “evidence before ideology”. It is welcome that the secretary of state says this is his own approach. Too many of his Conservative colleagues remain too strongly attached to fossil fuels, including the prospect of a whole new shale gas industry. As the price of renewables continues to fall, they will surely lose the argument. With Mr Clark in charge, the hope is that onshore wind and solar subsidies may soon return – though too late for UK companies that could have developed and profited from the technology had we not given up on it long before the renewables boom.Yet the government is planning more nuclear power stations, including one in Wales. Different rules seem to apply for different technologies. It looks like a Tory government in Westminster snubbed Welsh Labour’s pet project. Backers of the tidal project felt shut out by ministers. Wave\u0026nbspenergy lobbyists perhaps don’t have the firepower in Whitehall that others can muster. Mr Clark might have relied on the evidence to make a tough call not\u0026nbspto back a new, green technology. But it’s hard to shake off the impression that the decision was one rooted in the partisan politics of self-interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db7492fe30d22adaef7f97e29cf33b476f1806a5/0_201_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7750075127603c3d218da411e4a20706","title":"1m teaching prize winner launches uk school arts charity","story":"Andria Zafirakou recruits musicians, art historians and actors to her causeAfter winning a $1m global teaching prize, Andria Zafirakou could have paid off her mortgage, bought a Ferrari and put her feet up for the rest of her life.Instead, the north London teacher has announced she is using the money she won in March with the Varkey Foundation global teacher prize – a kind of Nobel prize for teaching – to set up a campaigning charity to get more artists and arts organisations into Britain’s schools.Surrounded by pupils, teachers, family and supporters including Simon Schama, Melvyn Bragg, the musician Naughty Boy and the artist Mark Wallinger, Zafirakou launched her charity, Artists in Residence, at her place of work for the past 12 years, Alperton community school in Brent, and said she wanted to bring about a classroom revolution. “This is our time, this is the time for the arts, we are going to make a change and do something quite incredible,” she said. “I knew what I had to do, I had to start a mission, a crusade, to help fix a mess, to raise the profile of arts in our schools.”The campaign stems from the difficulties many schools have in getting artists of any sort – whether an up-and-coming local musician or a major movie star – into schools to work with and inspire children.Zafirakou’s charity will essentially be a broker between schools and artists. “I get schools, I know the problems they have and I know the language of schools,” she said. “I know that many artists cannot get into schools because of logistical problems.”The project will begin as a pilot involving 30 schools in disadvantaged communities, before widening to the whole of London and then rolling out to the rest of the UK in 2019.Many will see it as an extraordinary act of altruism given there were no obligations attached to the prize money. “If this was the lottery it would have been a different situation, but it’s not the lottery,” Zafirakou said. “This is something I won because I’m a teacher so it’s right to give it back to the profession.”She said she felt her award recognised the importance of arts education in schools and society. “When you have kids who are not picking up arts because they do not know what the jobs are or don’t realise the value of it, that’s when alarm bells ring and you have to do something.”Schama, a professor of art history at Columbia University in the US, said Zafirakou was a force of nature and he was happy to be an artist-in-residence at Alperton. “When you have been dealing for a very long time with precociously over-educated graduate students, it’s fantastically thrilling to come to a school like this.”He said it was a mistake to see arts and music in schools as a luxury or an add-on. “It is an indispensable centre. What will remain of us when AI takes over will be our creativity, and it is our creative spirit, our visionary sense of freshness, which has been Britain’s strength for centuries.”He said the arts were particularly important at what he described as the start of a new age, “the beginning of an explosion of digital visual creativity”.Schama added: “At the moment huge grey tidal flows of money from Russia, China and the Middle East are flowing in to what will soon be the archaic world of dealers and art advisers. Very soon it will not be that.”Zafirakou hopes to sign up an army of artists and arts organisations who will work with schools for fixed periods, whether a day or a full academic year.She said subjects such as art, music and drama were being squeezed out of the curriculum at a time when they had never been more important. “They’re not only essential for personal growth and self-understanding but they also teach young people to think creatively, learn to communicate effectively and build resilience. All these skills will be important for the jobs that they are likely to do when they leave school.”Lord Bragg said: “The curious thing, and it has baffled me for years, is that the only people in the country who don’t get it are the politicians. I go the theatre quite a bit and I never see a politician … I wonder if they read books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725bca4e35958b17336e2b0d4cb51c5f97dc6066/71_24_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776ce98c8e6cae5d20524f5e2e96f74e","title":"spanish exam entries on track to surpass french in english schools","story":"Spanish on the rise, French in decline and German ‘in danger of extinction’Spanish is expected to overtake French as the main foreign language studied in classrooms in England in the next few years, and experts say German could face extinction from school timetables.A report by the British Council says that although the study of languages continues to decline, Spanish is bucking the trend, with entries up in both GCSEs and A-levels.Take-up of A-level French has fallen to 8,300, compared to 21,300 entries in 1997, and German is down to 3,300, but Spanish entries have climbed to 7,600. Based on current trends, Spanish is expected to overtake French as England’s most widely taught foreign language at A-level by 2020 and at GCSE by 2025.Vicky Gough, a schools adviser at the British Council, said: “There is a perception of Spanish being easier to pick up than other languages, which may account in part for its popularity, along with the fact that Spain is the most popular holiday destination for Brits, so young people can imagine having the chance to use it.”The diminishing popularity of languages in schools, sixth-forms and universities has been a source of concern to linguists for decades, and there have been fears more recently that Brexit could add to the trend.“It’s German I’m really worried about,” said Suzanne O’Farrell, a curriculum and assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders and a former headteacher and head of languages. “I think it’s in danger of extinction.“People are not offering it in schools. We will not have the teachers to teach it. There’s no take-up. As we see the rise of Spanish, it’s signalling the death knell of German.”The British Council report also highlights a growing ide in pupils’ access to the study of foreign languages, with uptake disproportionately lower at state schools in more disadvantaged areas.The report’s author, Teresa Tinsley, said: “The research shows that there is a growing rift between schools where languages are valued and developed imaginatively as part of a stimulating curriculum and those which are struggling to overcome disadvantage and a growth in negative attitudes.“These schools will need support and encouragement if all pupils across the board are to enjoy the enriching experience of learning a language.” He said: “It is critical that teachers encourage all pupils to take up a language, and we are supporting this through the creation of expert schools that will share best practice across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9a86ddf2b76c7913394523f7c0b4db3569c225f/158_382_1321_792/master/1321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbd8c6647c5cde81830ced1c71277d9","title":"rising seas florida climate change elizabeth rush","story":"Sea level rises are not some distant threat for many Americans they are very real. In an extract from her chilling new book, Rising, Elizabeth Rush details how the US coastline will be radically transformed in the coming yearsIn 1890, just over six thousand people lived in the damp lowlands of south Florida. Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand.A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand.“In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.”A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth.A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?”“Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.”According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet.Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and ide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic.But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.”It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M\u0026ampM’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future.One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M\u0026ampM’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same  of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began.I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible.Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head.He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone.The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea.“Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.”In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule.From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century.

Now researchers say that bumblebee colonies in urban areas not only produce more offspring than those on agricultural land, but have more food stores, fewer invasions from parasitic “cuckoo” bumblebees, and survive for longer.While researchers have previously found a greater variety of pollinator species in urban settings, Samuelson says the latest study goes further, revealing that it is not simply that bumblebees make a flying visit to urban locations, but that populations are stronger there.Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Samuelson and colleagues describe how they collected native queen bees from Windsor Great Park in the spring and put them into nest boxes to lay their first batch of eggs. The resulting young colonies were then placed at 38 sites between central London and Basingstoke. The queen in a colony, notes Samuelson, can lay eggs that give rise to more worker bees, which themselves cannot reproduce, or – once the colony reaches a certain size and strength – lay eggs that hatch bees that can reproduce: either females that will go on to become queens, known as gynes, or males.The team visited each colony once a week at night – when bees don’t fly – to count the number of worker bees, see whether the queen was alive, take stock of nectar and pollen stores and take note of – and remove – any cuckoo bumblebees.They also counted and removed any males or gynes – mimicking their natural tendency to leave the nest – and totted up the total number during the study. This continued until the colony petered out – a process that took a maximum of 10 weeks. The team then examined the 38 sites, each with a 500m radius, using aerial photographs and found that they fell into one of three groups based on various criteria of urban development, with five “agricultural”, 16 “village” and 17 labelled as “city” locations. The team’s analysis reveals that the type of land was linked to the success of the colony, with similar results for cities and villages, and worse outcomes for agricultural settings.Among the results, the team found that city colonies were significantly more likely to give rise to males and gynes than agricultural ones, with only one in the latter setting giving rise to such “reproductive” bees. What’s more, both village and city colonies had a markedly greater number of these bees over the course of the study than agricultural colonies, as well as more worker bees at their peak. The team also found that agricultural colonies were more often invaded by cuckoo bumblebees – possibly, the team say, because air pollution might mask chemical signals given off by coloniesWhile the study reveals that the urban boon for bees is, in part, linked to fewer invasions by cuckoo bees, Samuelson said the greater availability and variety of flowers in gardens and parks could also be a driver – although the analysis did not provide clear evidence that the proportion of flower-rich habitat had an impact.“Because bees are more likely to potentially be exposed to pesticides in the agricultural areas, maybe this is having an effect,” she added.Dr Mick Hanley, an expert in plant-animal interactions from the University of Plymouth who was not involved in the study, said it is likely many factors contribute to bumblebees are thriving in urban settings, adding that the cultivation of flowering plants throughout the year in villages and cities could also help bumblebees, compared to fields where, if they are present at all, flowering periods are short-lived. “We have always suspected that many pollinators, not just bees, are doing better in urban environments, but this actually gets at the nub, for one species, as to how and why they might be performing better biologically,” he said.Jane Memmott, professor of ecology at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the study, urged iniduals to give bumblebees a helping hand. “This paper provides definitive evidence of the value of urban areas to bumblebees,” she said. “Moreover, helping urban pollinators is the sort of conservation project that everyone can help with – if you have a garden, balcony or even just a sunny doorstep, you can grow plants for both bees and people to enjoy”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1581a86fbefcae9adb1586fe87c075bb7a73bb8f/0_213_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8837aa28f186b24489d791744a868dc","title":"red deer isle rum scotland in pictures","story":"A team of six scientists has descended on Rum, a small island in the Inner Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, to catch red deer calves.

Security was tight at both land-entry points but it has emerged that some fans could exploit weaknesses in the visa protocol to enter Russia without tickets.The Football Supporters’ Federation was able to obtain a number of so‑called Fan IDs, which allow visa‑free travel into Russia to those who have a ticket for matches. Stringent checks are supposed to be limited to one Fan ID per ticket.

The Football Association, through the England Supporters Club, has sold its allocation of 1,600 tickets for the Kaliningrad Arena. The newly built stadium holds 35,000 and it is expected that very few tickets will be available through other channels.It is thought the official supporters’ group has had only a slight increase of interest in tickets for the last-16 match.

Gylfi Sigurdsson had shown the kind of courage that has come to be associated with his country when he stepped forward to address a 76th-minute penalty, having missed from the spot in the previous tie against Nigeria.This time, he found the roof of the net and, when the news filtered through of Marcos Rojo’s 86th‑minute goal for Argentina that put them 2-1 up against Nigeria in the other Group\u0026nbspD tie, the equation became tantalisingly simple.Iceland needed one more goal. A 2-1 win would have sufficed. It would have taken the smallest nation to compete at the World Cup into the knockout rounds. They had the time to get it and the momentum was with them.Reality would intervene with a thud. Croatia, who had already qualified, had rested players and they performed largely within themselves, although they did rouse themselves in the second half. The tie hurtled into stoppage time, the drama crackling until the dying embers, but when Ivan Perisic fastened on to a slide-rule pass, the Croatia winger banged his shot into the far, top corner.For Iceland, it was over.There would be pride in defeat but also regret, with the biggest one being the failure to punish Nigeria in a game when they were on top in the first half. Iceland would lose 2-0. Heimir Hallgrímsson, the manager, talked of having played five good halves at this tournament and one bad.The other window for a one-goal Iceland victory had come after Lionel Messi put Argentina 1-0 in front with an early goal. The permutations would lurch throughout the evening but, in the end, Iceland could not look after what they needed to do. They did not have the requisite quality in front of goal when it mattered the most.Croatia advanced into a last-16 tie against Denmark in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday with maximum points and they could feel that the victory showcased the depth in their ranks. This squad – and every other one from their borders for the past couple of decades – has lived in the shadow of the great 1998 team who reached the semi-finals in France. Could this be the year when a new crop finally emulates them? It is the first time since then that they have reached the knockout phase. “Denmark is our moment of truth,” the manager, Zlatko Dalic, said.Iceland’s threat came from corners and Aron Gunnarsson long throw-ins – their physicality and directness is their greatest strength – but they also pieced together moves of promise and no little thrust. They had a flurry of chances before the interval and, when none of them went in, it was easy to fear that it would come back to haunt them.Alfred Finnbogason robbed the dawdling Milan Badelj on 41 minutes and, after he swapped passes with Gylfi Sigurdsson, he whistled a shot wide of the post. Iceland could not catch a break. Birkir Bjarnason, who had earlier been bloodied by Marko Pjaca’s elbow, saw a shot blocked by a combination of Duje Caleta-Car and the foot of the goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic, while Gunnarsson was also thwarted by a ing Kalinic save.Dalic’s wholesale changes had been anticipated but the surprise inclusion in his lineup was Luka Modric. The idea was that he would control the tempo but it did not really work out like that, despite some lovely touches from him. Dalic’s only other first‑choice in the starting XI was Perisic.Croatia offered nothing as an attacking force in the first half but they were more threatening after the break and they might have led when Badelj’s shot from distance deflected off Ragnar Sigurdsson and rattled the crossbar.Iceland felt a couple of sucker punches in the moments that followed. First, Victor Moses equalised for Nigeria, which was not good for them, but worse was to come. The Croatian incision came from the full‑back Josip Pivaric, and it was a sharp one.He crossed from inside the area on the left and, when it deflected, it sat up for the advancing Badelj. He still had plenty to do but the technique and timing of the finish were excellent. Hannes Halldórsson was powerless. At that point, Iceland need to score three times to overhaul Nigeria.They continued to fight and created further chances. Sverrir Ingason saw a header tipped over the crossbar before he sent another one against the woodwork while Bjarnason sliced horribly when gloriously placed from Finnbogason’s cross.Hallgrímsson went for broke, replacing the centre-half Ragnar Sigurdsson with the forward Björn Sigurdarson, and Sigurdsson’s penalty, awarded for handball against the substitute Dejan Lovren, represented a lifeline. Rojo’s goal brought another and the hope would surge. Perisic snuffed it out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa9d0bce99de22fe2b789a90483304df5f60340/0_223_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e9daf69f98a505eee2edb7ea78e4ad","title":"jogi low prove himself tackling germany structural flaw","story":"A vulnerability to fast breaks and counterattacks has been apparent during the holders’ first two World Cup matchesThis has been a difficult start to the World Cup for Germany but there are two positives. First, they have their own destiny in their hands and would go through to the knockout phase with a two-goal win against South Korea. And\u0026nbspsecond, their problems are readily identifiable: a midfield that does not protect the defence in transition and a forward line that, so far, has lacked an edge.Jogi Löw, the Germany manager, has been concerned enough to have “a lengthy chat” with Thomas Müller. “After the match against Mexico we tried to analyse his way of playing with the help of videos and clips,” Löw said. “He is somebody who is very open to comments and also critical in\u0026nbspself-appraisal.”There is not much Löw can do about that, and the carousel of four rotating forwards he fielded in the second game looked extremely dangerous until Sweden took the lead and provoked a measure of panic.The structure of the side, though, is his department. Mexico and Sweden were gifted opportunity after opportunity to counterattack down the flanks as Germany’s full-backs pushed up with no real cover offered by the back of midfield, even if Sebastian Rudy, who has a broken nose and will not be available, and then Ilkay Gündogan made a better fist of it in the second game than poor Sami Khedira, his legs seemingly gone, did in the first.That has been a persistent problem of late, with Germany conceding in each of their past seven games, a run stretching back to the 0-0 draw with England in November. The return of Mats Hummels from a neck injury should help but Jérôme Boateng is suspended. “If you look at all of those matches we are vulnerable to fast breaks and counterattacks,” Löw said. “It’s not always down to the defensive line: if we have three or four players racing towards the defensive line it’s an unfortunate situation. Against Sweden we were better in transition to a defensive action.”Better, but far from perfect. “South Korea have players who can use the space when it opens up,” Löw said. “It would be helpful on the whole if we could lose the ball less often.”In terms of player development and tactical approach, Germany have seemed recently a beacon of modernity, but there is a curious sense with this side that they are surviving on more traditional virtues. Two things changed for Germany at the 2006 World Cup, when Löw served as assistant to Jürgen Klinsmann.As they embraced progressiveness, two things were supposed to have been laid to one side: the dependence on Führungsspieler – leaders on the pitch – and the belief in themselves as a Turniermannschaft – a tournament team one, that is, that had a mental strength that meant they did not really have to play well to make progress through a tournament, just as the stodgy 2002 side had somehow reached the final.This was all part of Klinsmann’s revolution, itself part of the wider process of Das Reboot that overhauled academies and embraced the pressing game to which Germany had for so long been resistant. Yet Germany won the last World Cup and are still in this one because, when they needed it, they found the requisite inner drive and ruthlessness: there is a steel beneath the beauty. It allowed them to scramble through against Ghana and Algeria in 2014, and to stifle France and Argentina, and that quality was there again in abundance against Sweden.Toni Kroos, making up for his error, was just the sort of leader Germany needed him to be before bending in the brilliant winner. The mocking nature of the post-match celebrations that so angered the Swedes, while a world away from the antics of, say, the 1982 side, suggested that at least some of the old arrogance remains.The contrast with a South Korea who seem to have given up hope could hardly be more pronounced. Their coach Shin Tae-yong, who will be without the injured Park Joo-ho and Ki Sung-yueng, has come up with a variety of excuses to explain away his side’s poor performances all tournament. Sweden were too tall, while the defeat to Mexico was the result, apparently, of structural problems within the Korean league.Here, he seemed vaguely irritated that Germany had not qualified already and so will be playing a full‑strength side. “There is not enough time to fully prepare strategically for a match with Germany,” he said. “Even if we have improved the teamwork I don’t think it will be easy. We have a one per cent chance, a very slim hope.”Shin did, though, perk up when it was suggested he physically resembles Löw. “He is very fashionable,” he said.That was almost certainly a comment on his appearance, but his remark did seem inadvertently to hint at a pervasive sense that there is a superficiality to Löw, that his greatest gift as a coach is to have been in charge at just the right time to capitalise on a supreme generation of players. Now is the time for Löw to show he is a coach of substance and correct the structural\u0026nbspflaw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994ca5138e1dc19fcda015254a05d6af15142bcf/0_0_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa87e23d3409e8bd1b8285b336de545","title":"world cup 2018 reaction argentina win nigeria germany brazil mexico buildup live","story":"If you somehow missed any of that match, here’s Sid Lowe’s report from St Petersburg:And let’s not forget that before Rojo’s remarkable redemption strike, the Argentine centre half could have broken the hearts of his nation with an incongruous handball, off his own head, that in keeping with VARs scattershot approach to ball-to-hand incidents in the box this World Cup could have very, very possibly been given.That was very much the opinion of Nigeria’s crestfallen captain, Jon Obi Mikel. “I don’t understand how that was not a penalty: it was a clear handball,” he said post-game. “It was worse than the one that Portugal were given yesterday.” Messi for his part, admitted to the tremendous strain he and his fellow Argentines were under as he so eloquently put: “I don’t remember having ever suffered so much.” Sid Lowe again with the post-match wash up: And one fan lived ever ball in the manner perhaps in which he’s lived his entire incredible life.

At one stage this topsy-turvy pool almost boasted the following:Iceland lose to Nigeria Nigeria lose to Argentina Argentina lose to Croatia Croatia loses to Iceland. Football, eh?And if I’ve got these back-of-envelope calculations correct, it went a little like this:And that doesn’t even factor in Iceland fighting away in the background, being from 0-53 min and 76-90 min just a goal away from sending either of the above sides out.No wonder La Albiceleste and Super Eagles fans were going through the ringer!Cometh the 86th, cometh the man. No, not that man. Or even that other man. Or that man who was involved in the alleged palace coup on Sampaoli. Or that new man who started in goal. Or that man who plays for Juventus. Of all Argentina’s storied stars it was perhaps the most unlikely of heroes who emerged to resolve one of the most unpredictable of plotlines escape from Group D.If Scandinavia gave us A-ha, South America gave us Ro-jo. And after being unceremoniously dropped after #Icelandgate, it was the unfancied central defender, on his weaker foot, who rescued perhaps the proudest nation of all from World Cup ignominy.And so having seen one of the stuttering “big favourites” sneak through, today we turn to two more great under-performers will there be a scare or two in store for Germany or Brazil? And then equally as important perhaps how will Groups E \u0026amp F resolve - and even if the heavyweights get through, will it be only to set up a mouth-watering round of 16 rematch of the Mineiraço of four years ago?Seven of the eight teams remain in contention (no matter how slender South Korea’s chances are) so we should be set for four more compelling clashes, in a tournament that’s thus far delivered in spades.

This funding is at the levels seen in cycling Meccas such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam and higher than in any other UK city, according to Chris Boardman, the region’s walking and cycling commissioner.Boardman, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics and wore the Yelllow Jersey in the Tour de France, is also lobbying the government to allow him to change traffic lights to give cyclists and pedestrians more time and priority to cross busy junctions safely.He said he was “absolutely unapologetic” that his plans would take space away from cars and could make motor journeys slower in what is already a traffic-snarled region.“If you want to make people change their habits you’ve got to give them a viable alternative and in some cases that’s reprioritising streets and that’s what we are doing,” he said in an interview with the .“You’ll feel comfortable if you follow this sign. If it’s on a major road it will be segregated, if it’s on a minor road it won’t be,” he said.Since his appointment last year, Boardman and his team have worked with each of Greater Manchester’s 10 combined authorities on the plans. Each borough has been allowed to choose one key route where segregated lanes will appear over the next six years, with most opting for a busy road into Manchester itself. The proposals, which are subject to formal approval by Greater Manchester combined authority on Friday, also includes plans for 1,400 safe crossings that will facilitate the majority of routes and 25 “filtered neighbourhoods”, where the priority is given to the movement of people and where spaces to sit, play and socialise are created.Burnham, said: “Greater Manchester has a long history of doing innovative things and our approach to Beelines is no different. This proposal is bold and I make no apology for that. If we are to cut congestion and clean up our air, decisive action is needed. I want to make Greater Manchester one of the top 10 places in the world to live and it is action of this sort which will help to deliver that promise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e5d688c17f8261a7bce7e356ea314584aab93a/56_563_4528_2717/master/4528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6005f3d7ffd65039f0c74ea8c44bd89e","title":"amateur dramatics my week playing for simon rattle","story":"What’s it like to be directed by the great conductor?

I’m reminded why I decided not to become a professional musician.Yet for five days in May, with 100 other amateur musicians, I was allowed to dream. We were the guests of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, selected (by video audition) from 1,900 applicants from 30 countries to be part of the BE PHIL Orchestra, conducted in Brahms’s First Symphony by Sir Simon himself. When we meet for the first time in the foyer of the Philharmonie, we are like giddy children who have won Willy Wonka’s golden tickets. Over the first two days, we rehearse with conductor and Berlin Phil violinist Stanley Dodds, one of the brains behind the project. He balances and tunes us, points out important lines, characters and details, makes us listen to each other, and gives us an idea of Rattle’s tempos. On day three we learn that Rattle is in the building – a buzz goes round the coffee room and everyone tries to act normal. And then he’s on the podium welcoming us. “I’m so delighted. Thank you so much … I can’t wait. Let’s just play some Brahms.” And how we play: our focus and energy are through the roof.In our six hours of rehearsal with Rattle, his enthusiasm and commitment never wane. He offers historic context: Brahms only added the introduction after hearing Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, so although usually his music should never sound like Wagner this is an exception. There are narratives to help bring out the emotional complexities: one bar, Brahms is full of longing for Clara Schumann the next he remembers he’s living in the house of her husband and his mentor. Jokes: Woody Allen’s one about his brain being his second-favourite organ (for when the double basses aren’t following the baton). Analogies: Siegmund Nissel of the Amadeus Quartet’s likening of the string quartet to a bottle of wine applies also to orchestras: the cellos are the bottle, the first violins the label – but the second violins and violas are the wine itself.We also witness flashes of frustration: when people don’t watch him, play too loudly, forget instructions and especially when we don’t go with his tempos. A few times he taunts us on our tuning, but gently, despite how much it must grate to hear such muddy imperfection. It’s a little wounding, however, that in some bars he conducts every beat to help us stay together, as if we are a school orchestra. Interlaced with the frustrations are moments of intense joy. I’m reduced to tears hearing the yearning oboe and violin solos in the second movement, and the alpine theme in the horn and flute, played exquisitely by my new friends, knowing that they too are doing this for love and fulfilment. At the glorious last-movement theme, I am brimming with love for Brahms, my colleagues, for sheer joy of being alive. We prove the cliche that music is an international language. We come from countries and cultures as various as Brazil, Bolivia, Trinidad, Taiwan and Turkey we range in age from 10 to 75. Some of us went to conservatoires, some not among us are students, postmen, teachers, software developers, office managers, doctors, airline pilots and scientists. I sit next to a Japanese research scientist, and even though our conversation is sometimes stilted, it’s easy to play with him. It’s the cultural mores beyond the music that are confusing: whether to shake hands or hug after the concert the toilet queue that forms because none of the non-Germans understands the flush system.Our concert is part of the Philharmonie’s open day. Around the building are concerts by children, students and Berlin Phil players, masterclasses, tours, a horn flashmob, world music, premieres. More than 10,000 people pour into the building 6,000 more watch on the Digital Concert Hall and 200,000 on Facebook.At the end of the dress rehearsal, Rattle exhorts us to have fun, tell our story – and make mistakes. We take him at his word. Our performance is full-throttle, but some things we rehearsed don’t work. Most do. It doesn’t matter, though, because we’re giving it all we have. Rattle is, too. The audience goes wild and he gets three call-backs as we stand on stage dazed and a little heartbroken that it’s all over. Back in London, aglow with the stardust that’s been sprinkled on my musical life, I return to my regular amateur group, Corinthian Chamber Orchestra. Contrary to a popular narrative, most of my orchestral friends are not “posh”. Most got into playing music at school and through the local authority-funded services and youth orchestras that have been devastated in recent years. As the effects of the government’s policy of excluding arts subjects from the Ebacc core subjects are becoming apparent, access to a life with music is increasingly limited to those who can afford it. Rattle himself recently wrote a letter to the Times about the current destruction of music education. “The future may be uncertain and difficult for the next generation, but unless they have access to a vital cultural education they will be utterly unprepared for what this new world might require.”This is not just about children, though. What of the consequences 30 years down the line? What then of amateur music and its benefits to the inidual and to society – the friendships and social networks, good mental and intellectual health, creativity and sheer joy? As we face existential crisis, along with epidemics of dementia and loneliness, amateur music-making is more important than ever.For many professionals, amateurs are the untouchables of the classical music world – unglamorous and unteachable. Rattle and the Berlin Phil’s unique initiative is a visionary act of idealism and generosity that demonstrates their stated commitment to the benefits of music from cradle to grave. If I may pile yet another expectation on the conductor’s arrival in the UK as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, it is this: I hope he brings this big-hearted, inclusive, life-changing approach with him, and that politicians, cultural institutions and his colleagues take note. Playing Brahms with him in the Philharmonie will always be a privilege – one of the greatest of my life – but having an active and inspiring music life, at any level, should not be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe0d8d437fa9e9cb93606db649ae7ec7243ea186/244_73_1527_916/master/1527.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d54f9e7533c05e33164b9f80ba903e","title":"young fathers disinvited and then reinvited by german arts festival","story":"U-turn by Ruhrtriennale festival comes after group were dumped over their support for pro-Palestinian groupA leading German music and arts festival has been thrown into disarray after its organisers disinvited – and then reinvited – the Scottish band Young Fathers over their support for the pro-Palestine Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.The artistic director of the Ruhrtriennale announced earlier this month that the British hip-hop trio would be dropped from the lineup of the festival, which takes place from 18 August to 30 September. In a statement, Stefanie Carp said although she did not believe that criticising the politics of the Israeli government was antisemitic, the Mercury prize-winning group had “regrettably failed to distance itself from BDS”.But on Thursday, the festival organisers made a 180-degree turn. Not only did they reinvite Young Fathers, but also encouraged them to explain their position on the stage.“As a German, it is of course difficult for me to be linked to a movement that boycotts Israel,” Carp said. “But I have invited the Young Fathers and not the BDS.”A spokesperson for Ruhrtriennale told the  that Young Fathers had informed them that they could not take up the reinvitation.Some artists who had initially withdrawn from the Ruhrtriennale in solidarity with the Scottish group, including Lebanese guitarist Sharif Sehnaoui, said they had accepted their places in the festival programme. Ruhrtriennale organisers said the rest of the events would go ahead as scheduled, with the addition of a panel debate on the reasons behind the fallout.Nonetheless, Carp’s U-turn was criticised in Germany by local Jewish organisations and Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen, the culture minister for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. “It cannot be excluded that this decision will give the BDS campaign a platform at the Ruhrtriennale,” said Pfeiffer-Poensgen. “At times of increasing antisemitic crimes and other incidents, sadly also in North-Rhine Westphalia, this is the wrong signal.”Over the course of the last 10 months, mayors of German cities including Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt have likened BDS’s call for boycotts against Israel to practices from the Nazi era. There have been calls for a ban on the use of public spaces for BDS activities.In a letter published in the  on Tuesday, 75 artists and cultural figures criticised what they believed were “attempts to impose political conditions on artists supporting Palestinian human rights”, describing the initial decision to drop Young Fathers as “censorship, ‘blacklisting’ and repression”.Signatories of the letter include Patti Smith, who performed at the Ruhrtriennale in 2005, and Massive Attack, who played the festival in 2013.The Young Fathers performance is the latest in a series of concerts recently cancelled in Germany in connection to artists’ support for the BDS movement. In 2017, Young Fathers were one of a number of bands who pulled out of Berlin’s Pop-Kultur festival after it had emerged that the Israeli embassy had donated €500 (£440) to help to cover the travel costs of performers coming from Israel. The Israeli embassy was listed as a partner on event posters.British musician Richard Dawson, as well as UK-based acts Shopping and Gwenno, have withdrawn from the lineup for this year’s Pop-Kultur festival, with the former citing the shooting of Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli border forces as a reason for cancelling his appearance.Last September, English performance poet Kate Tempest cancelled a concert at Berlin’s Volksbühne theatre after what her management said were “personal threats via email and over social media” over her support for the BDS movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aab6efee7ce3ecee398778d10aad3c026d12d44b/0_0_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=748195c6e341eee7a8b02b1e860c95e6","title":"afghan holiday catches up with crumpled boris in commons","story":"Jet-lagged foreign secretary fends off dopey MPs’ questions on Trump and footballThere hadn’t even been enough time for him to lie down in protest – at his own schedule, if not the building of a third runway. Just hours after landing at Heathrow on his return from his city break, Boris Johnson found himself facing departmental questions. He’d tried to get out of it by extending his stay in Kabul but the airline’s automated helpline said his return ticket was non-transferable, leaving him no choice but to come home.So it was a more crumpled than usual Boris who stood up to take a barrage of questions on Britain’s relations with the US. Maybe it was the jet lag, but the foreign secretary didn’t seem to think anything was particularly amiss. When he’d last looked, everything had been just fine. Would that do?It wouldn’t. Several MPs reminded him that Donald Trump had recently separated immigrant children from their parents and slung them in cages. Something stirred in the mush that passed for Boris’s brain. Cages? He vaguely remembered something about cages. Though cages was probably a bit too strong a word. More like rooms with bars. Quite nice rooms with bars. Though with no carpets.In any case, Theresa May – along with almost every other world leader – had spoken to Trump and he’d now signed executive orders to reverse his decision. So now the kiddies and their parents would be placed in cages together. Trump the homemaker. The family that’s caged together stays together. Mainly because there’s nowhere else for them to go. Who said the special relationship was no longer special?This didn’t get quite the triumphant reception Boris had hoped for. The SNP’s Stephen Gethins observed that the foreign secretary had recently declared himself to be growing in admiration for Trump. What did he admire most: caging children or the arbitrary imposition of trade tariffs? Boris hummed and hawed, willing his synapses to connect. Um … he quite liked the president’s plans to build beachside condos in North Korea. He had enjoyed the bombing of Syria. And he loved the Donald’s hair. The hair was great.After a gentle tease about the lengths to which he would go to conclusively prove he really didn’t give a toss about keeping his word, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, invited Boris to list three things he admired in the US president. Which might have been rather more effective if Boris hadn’t just done that. Sometimes it helps to be able to think on your feet. Even in his confused state, Boris was able to remember his previous answers.Thornberry had another go. Trump bans Muslims, supports Nazis and cages children, so why had the foreign secretary said Trump ought to be running Brexit? Boris again couldn’t believe his luck as Thornberry had just answered her own question. Duh! Fuck business: it was about time all the touchy-feely nonsense came to an end and someone started making Brexit really unpleasant for everyone. That’s what people had been promised and that’s what they should get.Having exhausted his knowledge of US-UK relations, Boris slumped on to the frontbench to let his colleagues answer the other questions. He yawned frequently and his eyes gently closed. Before long his Afghan hols had caught up with him and he was near comatose. Probably just as well, because that way he didn’t have to hear the junior minister Mark Field say the foreign secretary might visit Africa if the opportunity to miss any difficult votes arose.What had Boris learned from his day trip to Afghanistan, Labour’s Dan Jarvis demanded. The foreign secretary hauled himself to the dispatch box once more. This was an easy one. He had spent most of the flight home on Wikipedia. Afghanistan was a landlocked country of 252,000 square miles situated somewhere in central and southern Asia. For the first time in the session, he began to relax. He’d expected to be embarrassed. To have his integrity questioned. But everyone had been just as dopey as him.Conservative Scott Mann ended the session by asking what advice Boris had for England football fans in Russia. “Don’t let their hopes get away with them,” he said brusquely. It was time for everyone to have the same expectations of their football team as they did of him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277a971f3db7a7f539b92c1ac04df302713d8add/134_41_2263_1357/master/2263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d65804138d7a6ce97389d00af89bf39a","title":"firm co founded by jeremy hunt broke law","story":"Restructuring of Hotcourses reduced health secretary’s tax bill by about £100,000A company co-founded by Jeremy Hunt breached company law before carrying out a restructuring designed to reduce the health secretary’s tax bill by about £100,000, it has emerged.Hotcourses, which was at the time majority-owned by Hunt, failed to file crucial documents with Companies House for over three years, when the law says they must be filed within 15 days.It was reported in 2012 that Hunt reduced his potential tax bill by around £100,000 by moving an office building out of the educational listings company before a change to the idend rate.The Hotcourses’ mistake is a further embarrassment for the health secretary, who recently had to apologise after being investigated by the standards commissioner for failing to report ownership of seven flats in Southampton through a company. Hunt’s accountant, Grunberg \u0026amp Co, said their failure to file the documents was “regrettable” and an “administrative error”, but not Hunt’s error as at the time he was a shareholder and not a director. Hunt referred inquiries to his accountant. As has been previously reported, Hunt and his business partner, Mike Elms, transferred an office building in 2010 worth £1.8m out of Hotcourses and into their own names. They then immediately started renting the building back to the company. According to documents filed at Companies House, Hunt and other shareholders signed documents to vary the rules of the company in February 2010. However, it was not until May 2013 that the “articles of association” were sent to Companies House. Hunt’s accountants said that the idend in specie could have been paid under the old articles of association, so the tax position would not have been affected by the changes. Hunt stopped being a director of Hotcourses in 2009 but remained the largest shareholder in the company. Grunberg said it was the responsibility of the directors to file the documents. Hunt co-founded Hotcourses in 1990. In 2017, the company was sold for £30.1m to IDP Education, a Melbourne-based student placement company that co-owns the popular IELTS English language proficiency test. The sale netted Hunt around £14.5m, which made him one of the richest Conservative MPs. In the MPs’ register of interests, Hunt also declares a half-ownership of a house in Italy. Hunt’s shares have been held in a blind trust since he became a cabinet minister in 2010. Hotcourses runs a variety of education-search websites including Whatuni, Postgraduate Search and the Complete University Guide. It also operates sites under its own name.Hunt, who recently became the longest serving health secretary in history, has said previously that the success of Hotcourses came only after he and Elms had pursued a string of failed ventures, including a scheme to export marmalade to Japan and building children’s playgrounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915d91531f44ccbe2754995b49be9db94f63d2bd/16_65_1255_752/master/1255.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b596d9d2ce13edf9b32632e0eda342","title":"muslim group accuses tories of turning blind eye to islamophobia claims","story":"Muslim Council of Britain writes again to party chairman calling for internal inquiryThe Muslim Council of Britain has accused the Conservative party of hoping allegations of Islamophobia in its ranks will “magically go away” and complained that the party’s chairman has not responded to its call for an internal inquiry.Three weeks after it first raised the issue, the group wrote again to Brandon Lewis on Tuesday highlighting further allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice within Tory ranks. It said it was not acceptable to turn “a blind eye to legitimate concerns about bigotry”.The MCB said further examples of alleged Islamophobic abuse had emerged, including the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi saying she had been racially abused at meetings, and a pro-Tory Facebook group that contained a string of anti-Muslim threats.The MCB letter, a copy of which has been seen by the , says: “Three weeks ago we wrote to you requesting an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative party. Sadly we have neither received an acknowledgement nor a reply.“We cannot have an approach where you are hoping that the issue would magically go away so that it could avoid a bruising inquiry into anti-Muslim prejudice.”The MCB also cited comments by a former parliamentary candidate, Shazia Awan, who said she had quit the party because it had “a notion that Islam is not compatible with British values”.Although Lewis did not respond directly to the MCB letter, he wrote an article for Conservative Home 10 days ago in which he said the party would work with the anti-racism group TellMama, would make ersity training available to party members and would remind local associations of the standards of behaviour expected. “A single case of abuse is one too many, and since becoming chairman I have taken a zero-tolerance approach,” he wrote.One Tory member had told it about a local party leader who said another member looked “too Muslim” and “wouldn’t be accepted”, and it had also heard of “five BME Tory members being seated on a single table at the back of a room at a Conservative association dinner”.Relations between the MCB and the Conservatives have been fractious ever since the group called for an internal inquiry at the end of May. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said shortly afterwards that the MCB “does not represent Muslims in this country”, prompting the MCB to accuse him of “shooting the messenger”.At the time the MCB asked why no action had been taken against Bob Blackman, the Harrow East MP, after he retweeted an anti-Islam message from the hard-right activist Tommy Robinson, and hosted a hardline Hindu nationalist, Tapan Ghosh, in parliament. Blackman said he had retweeted the Robinson post accidentally and had not known in advance that Ghosh was being invited to an event last October.Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB, said: “We earnestly hope that the Conservative party addresses concerns of Islamophobia with the seriousness it deserves. The true extent of the problem can only be achieved via an independent inquiry.”The Conservative party declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a74da6bcb324fd412fedf8441915deb47126c0/0_195_2390_1433/master/2390.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc7a436be9c57cd8e8deac51c4e7356f","title":"tory justine greening rules herself out of london mayoral race","story":"The Putney MP reveals decision after being tipped for 2020 campaign against Sadiq KhanThe former education secretary Justine Greening has ruled herself out from running as the Conservative candidate for London mayor, leaving the party without a big name in the race to take on Sadiq Khan.The Putney MP had been tipped as the favourite to challenge the incumbent Labour mayor in the next contest, which takes place in 2020.Many Tory insiders believed that Greening, as a socially liberal woman with a newly found independent streak who also happened to be the first openly gay woman in the cabinet, was ideally placed to present the modern face of the party.The Tories were badly tainted by Zac Goldsmith’s unsuccessful campaign in 2016, which was criticised for its racist undertones and which many London Conservative politicians feared did the party permanent damage to its reputation in the capital.Greening also gained a wealth of experience in transport – a key responsibility for the mayor – during her stint as transport secretary, as well as a clear passion for social mobility, founded in her working class, comprehensive-educated background, and crystallised during her time as education secretary.She revealed her decision in a tweet to a grassroots campaign group, JustineForMayor, which also featured a video setting out her plans for improving social mobility. Sources close to the MP confirmed to the  she had ruled herself out of the mayoral race. Greening tweeted: “All your support is hugely appreciated, but as an MP I’m focusing on socialmobilitypledge.org to drive opportunity for people across our whole country so won’t be putting my name forward.”The Conservatives began their process of selecting their candidate this month, giving them a two-year campaign to unseat Khan, who is expected to be the favourite to win in 2020.The timetable for the Tory selection means that nominations close in July, with a summer campaign culminating in a final vote in September. The Conservatives are understood to feel that Goldsmith wasn’t given enough time to establish his campaign, having only been selected in September 2015 before the vote in May 2016. His campaign also suffered from the allegations of using dog-whistle tactics against Khan. Since leaving the cabinet in January, Greening, a vocal remain campaigner, has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, socially liberal voters. Her majority was slashed at the last general election, from more than 10,000 to just 1,554.Labour are polling ahead in London, although the Conservatives have been buoyed by better than expected local election results, in which Labour failed to take target councils including Barnet and Wandsworth. Other candidates who have been tipped to run for London mayor include MEP Syed Kamall, who was defeated by Goldsmith to be the Tory candidate in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e62f6506dbad4919c144968845f5c8d3ff3b698/0_16_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce78d3415840409ae95fd41a3be7026","title":"unions join business leaders to demand urgency in brexit talks","story":" TUC and CBI release rare joint statement as cabinet tensions flare into the open over issueBritish and European trade unions and business organisations have joined forces to demand that “pace and urgency” be injected into the Brexit talks as complaints about the lack of progress made in negotiations intensified ahead of this week’s EU summit.The TUC and the CBI released a rare joint statement with their continental counterparts calling for “measurable progress”, a day after the car industry called for a Brexit deal that delivers “single market benefits” and cabinet tensions over the issue flared into the open.The workers’ and business organisations said: “We are calling on the UK government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland. “Decisions will be needed in June and October to finalise the withdrawal agreement and the transitional arrangement, and put economic interests and people’s jobs, rights and livelihoods first.” It added: “The cost of disagreement between the UK and the EU would be dire for firms, workers and the communities where they live.”Earlier on Tuesday, car manufacturers said there would be no “Brexit idend” for the industry, with investment in the sector and thousands of jobs being put at risk unless the government rethinks its red lines in negotiations.Ministers have been forced on the defensive since the end of last week after Airbus and BMW said jobs in the UK were at risk if manufacturers could not easily import components from the EU after Brexit. But the CBI and TUC said their concern spread further, to 23 industrial sectors which want “regulatory alignment” post orce.They range from banking and financial services, through to energy, broadcasting and professional services all of which seek mutual recognition of each other’s regulatory systems post Brexit. Such agreement was of “utmost importance”, said the TUC and CBI in remarks approved by Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, and Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general.May tried to allay some of the concerns on Tuesday by saying it is “right that we listen to the voice of business”, in a corporate summit sponsored by the Times, as she also attempted to counter some of anti-business remarks made by other cabinet colleagues over the last few days. “We have listened carefully to the voices of business throughout, and your input has helped to shape our negotiating position,” the prime minister added, two days before she is due to head to Brussels for a European Council meeting which is likely to be dominated by arguments over migration and see little substantive progress on Brexit.The prime minister’s remarks also amounted to a rebuke of Boris Johnson, who effectively admitted in the Commons that he had said, in response to corporate lobbying, “fuck business” at an industry event last week. “I don’t think anybody could doubt the passionate support of this government for business,” the foreign secretary told MPs, before adding: “It may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business.”The former Brexit minister David Jones criticised Clark’s stance, telling the Daily : “There is a risk he is unwittingly participating in Project Fear mark two, which is being orchestrated by EU-based businesses.”Cabinet members were told by David Davis in the morning that the government would try to provide more details of its plans when its long-awaited Brexit white paper is published on Monday 9 July.That will come after an away day held the Friday before at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat. All cabinet members are expected to attend the event, which will conclude with a working dinner, a move that is expected to help May because the proportion of loyalists is greater amongst the full team.Labour accused the government of botching Brexit “by bickering amongst themselves” rather than “negotiating a sensible deal with the EU”. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, added: “Time is running out. Business, consumers and workers need certainty and workers, not endless chaos, egos and melodrama.”The car lobby told the government on Tuesday that it needed “as a minimum” to remain in the customs union and a deal that delivered “single market benefits”. “There is no Brexit idend for our industry,” Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said.He said Brexit uncertainty was thwarting investment and repeated calls for the UK to stay in the customs union until the government came up with a “credible plan B”. Negotiators had to get on with the job of agreeing a deal that would put an end to uncertainty and prioritise the needs of the automotive sector, because investment was slowing and time running out, the SMMT said at a day-long summit.  BMW, which employs 8,000 people in the UK, said it needed to know by the end of the summer what the Brexit strategy was as that was when key decisions would be made. Ian Robertson, the most senior British executive at the German firm, said: “We are not turning our backs on the UK.” But he said that any delay in Dover “would start to impact” upon manufacturing and its competitiveness. He added that BMW was not intending to move any car production to any of its other plants around the world but it would be “foolhardy” not to have “contingency ideas”.Hawes told reporters at the International Automotive Summit in London that “signs were more ominous” for investment this year after eight years of growth.“If we cannot cut through the fog of the uncertainty there will be casualties,” he said. “For this year are more ominous, contingency planning, job losses, investment halved to less than £350m so far year, that’s the cost of uncertainty, that that’s the price we pay for slow decision-making,.”A spokeswoman for the Brexit department said it agreed with business leaders. “We are confident that we can make progress if both the EU and UK engage constructively,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026a15d1067b0350757d031ab900947b0831c4b8/0_323_4839_2903/master/4839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec101413f7854cd15a28ff727315bc5","title":"tony blair return to dark 1930s politics no longer far fetched","story":"Former PM to say Trump must preserve the transatlantic pact and unite with EuropeA return to the dark politics of the 1930s is no longer far-fetched today because of rampant nationalist populism and the widespread rejection of multilateral alliances, according to Tony Blair.In a stark speech to the Chatham House thinktank in London, the former British prime minister will say he has never been so worried about the future of the UK.Blair will also tell Donald Trump, ahead of the US president’s visit to Europe next month, that he must act to preserve the transatlantic alliance, or else he will weaken the whole of the west in the struggle against rising nations such as China.Blair is due to say: “We need to know from the current American administration and its president that our alliance matters, that it is regarded, historically and contemporaneously, as a vital American strategic interest.”“We are losing sight of the values which brought the west together, saw it through the menace of fascism and communism”, he will add.Blair also urges the Trump administration to counter “with vigour and urgency” the widely held view that it wants the transatlantic alliance to fracture, saying: “The only people that would gain from this are America’s rivals or adversaries.”Blair, who has defended strong UK-US relations for more than two decades, is clearly concerned that Trump has no feel for the historical depth of his country’s relationship with Europe, and may see the break-up of the EU as something unimportant or even beneficial to the US.The former Labour PM is expected to assert: “The transatlantic alliance is the bedrock of our values system and way of life. Yet the rightwing relegation of it as secondary to national interest rather than part of it and the kneejerk leftwing reaction against anything American-led, is leaving this alliance in danger of fracture“We need leaders both sides of the water explaining its importance and seeking ways of strengthening it.”Blair, who maintains close relations with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, mainly over the middle east, will not directly accuse the president of populism, but his speech makes little attempt to hide his dislike of this political style.He is due to say: “Globalisation and its advocates are on the back foot. Populism of left and right meet at a certain point in denunciation of free trade arrangements, migration and international alliances. All are portrayed as contrary to putting inidual national interest first.“Once it is clear the populism isn’t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work. “Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.”He will also bluntly tell US diplomats not to imagine that either Brexit or a wider break-up of the EU will be in US interests.“America needs Europe united and standing with it, not isolated as inidual nations, able to be picked off one by one by the then emerged new powers”.He will also weigh in on the state of the Brexit talks: “We cannot go on like this. I have never been more worried about the future of our country than now, with competing emotions of anxiety and rage.“We have a government whose every move is a calculation not about the interests of the nation, but the internal balance of advantage between the factions of the Conservative party, with the prime minister more a hostage than a leader. “Meanwhile the leader of the Labour party neglects to lead the fight here at home over an issue which literally determines the future of Britain and where he could play a decisive role.”Blair will call on MPs to assert themselves, adding: “the UK needs to plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline for the end of the negotiations”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97d9adb4281d3481701ce0c8f2e4d262771b3319/0_4_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd7d91439952eb1c9335c46137316651","title":"james harden nba mvp houston rockets","story":"After several second-place finishes, the Houston Rockets star has won his first MVP award, capping off a year in which he proved his critics wrongJames Harden was literally speechless when he was named the NBA’s most valuable player on Monday night: he did not have a script on hand. After thanking his mother, who was standing next to him on stage, an uncharacteristically emotional Harden exclaimed: “Sixth Man of the Year to MVP,” referencing the last major inidual award he won, before exhorting kids to chase their dreams.The NBA Awards are a strange event. Although they aired well after the NBA finals this year – blame the Golden State Warriors for beating the Cleveland Cavaliers so swiftly – the actual voting takes place before the postseason even begins. This can lead to potential awkwardness. For instance, on Monday, current Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey won Coach of the Year for the job he did with the Toronto Raptors, the team that fired him immediately after the Cavaliers swept them out of the playoffs. Beyond anything else, the weirdness comes from the interminable wait between the awards and the end of the NBA regular season, which was way back on 11 April. At least this time it’s somewhat fitting, because Harden knows a thing or two about waiting. “The last four years have been like knocking on the door,” he said after his speech, adding: “I felt like last year I should have won as well, so I didn’t see a difference between last year and this year.”He’s not wrong. In different circumstances, Harden probably would have won the 2016-17 NBA MVP, but his former teammate Russell Westbrook wowed the world by averaging a triple-double and beating Oscar Robertson’s then-record regular season total in that category. Back in 2015, Harden came in second to Stephen Curry during a year in which the Warriors guard broke his own record for three-pointers and led his team to 67 regular season wins.This time around there was very little suspense. Harden received 86 first-place votes. In comparison, the second place finisher, little-known Cavaliers player LeBron James, garnered just 15 first-place votes. No surprises there. Harden averaged 30.4 points, 8.8. assists and 5.4 rebounds per game during the regular season all while leading the Rockets team to 65 wins, the best total in the league and in franchise history.If Harden felt a certain amount of vindication after finally winning MVP, one could hardly blame him. For much of his time in Houston, Harden put up the statistics of a star player while gathering regular criticism for his unconventional play. Most infamously, there were the lapses in defense where it often looked like he had stopped trying. Then there was his borderline miraculous ability to draw fouls to get to the free-throw line, which opposing fans took to call “flopping.” You could even take issue with the mechanical, assembly-line nature of Harden’s three-point shooting.Comments about his defense aside (and he has made a noticeable improvement in that aspect of his game), you’ll notice that these are mostly aesthetic complaints rather than serious attacks on Harden’s ability to play. No one likes to watch basketball games continually halted by referees’ whistles – after all, free throws are the tasteless iceberg lettuce of basketball. If Harden played with the joyful enthusiasm of a Curry rather than with his trademark vacant Michael Myers stare, it would be easier to love his prolific three-point shooting.However, if there was one criticism that stuck more than any other it was this: Harden’s teams couldn’t win during the playoffs. It’s possible that the “choking” narrative started in 2012, the year he won the Sixth Man of the Year Award he mentioned on Monday. His inexplicable disappearance in the NBA finals – he managed only 12.4 points per game despite being the team’s third best player – was cited as a reason that the Thunder fell to the Miami Heat in just five games. Oklahoma City then traded him to the Rockets in what was then a controversial move. This writer’s reaction was “Harden is a great player, a perennial All-Star, but he’s not the No 1 option on a true contender.”Yeah, about that.After Houston handed him a starting role, the magnificently bearded Harden almost immediately became the face, and facial hair, of the franchise. More than any other move, the Rockets’ trade for Harden established them as perennial contenders. Meanwhile, the Thunder never fully recovered. Still, Harden’s Houston teams have struggled with a reputation of faltering in the playoffs. That reputation probably wasn’t completely rehabilitated this year, not when the last image we have of the 2017-18 Rockets is them going 0-for-27 beyond the three-point line in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, but maybe it should. Bucking the odds, the Rockets managed to take the mighty Warriors to seven games and, had point guard Chris Paul not gotten hurt in Game 5, there’s a very good chance they could have advanced to the NBA finals to face a vulnerable Cleveland Cavaliers team.Of course, we can’t know if that’s what would have happened, which is why the league collects MVP votes before the playoffs begin. In the postseason, all it takes is one game, one injury or some other reversal of fortune to alter the entire a player’s year and erase an entire season’s worth of success. Regardless of how it ended, Harden deserved the MVP this year and he has earned the respect that goes with it, even if he may never win the love of every NBA fan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3216df2c229bdf0fa8698286c57bd2a63a888ac9/0_183_2611_1566/master/2611.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede7c7a06c5d202836ba0724213a0ef4","title":"paul farbrace england jos buttler australia t20","story":"Paul Farbrace has confirmed his interest in becoming England’s next full-time head coach and made a positive first move as the interim for the Twenty20 against Australia on Wednesday night by promoting Jos Buttler to open.Farbrace takes over for this one-off fixture at a sold-out Edgbaston, and the three that follow against India next week, while Trevor Bayliss spends a fortnight scouting county players and taking a break from the packed schedule.With the Australian standing down at the end of next year, however, his long-time assistant with England – and previously Sri\u0026nbspLanka – is keen to step up even if he insists this latest spell as a caretaker, having done the same before the arrival of Bayliss in 2015 and on a tour to the Caribbean last year, is not a pitch for the top spot.Asked if he fancied the role, Farbrace replied: “Of course. If, next September, Andrew Strauss said, ‘we want to offer you the job as coach’, or, as has been discussed, splitting it and me looking after one of the teams, it would be so difficult to say no. I’d be thrilled.“But I don’t think the next 10 days are necessarily about me at all really. Eoin Morgan is captain. He’s the focal point of our team, and whoever is here looking after the side it’s our job to make sure we support and guide him.”England’s recent use of 20-over internationals to rest multi-format mainstays and test fringe players has led to a dip in the rankings, such that it is a case of No\u0026nbsp5 hosting No\u0026nbsp2 in this tour-ending fixture for an Australia side whitewashed in the one‑dayers but welcoming fresh blood in the batsman Nic Maddinson and the leg‑spinner Mitchell Swepson.For England this is a full-strength squad again – bar the continued absence of Ben Stokes, who is nearly ready to return from a hamstring injury – with Buttler, fresh from a stunning century at Old Trafford on Sunday, opening alongside Jason Roy. The reason? To get their hottest talent facing as many of the 120 balls sent down as possible.On Buttler, who made a man-of-the-match 73 not out against Sri Lanka two years ago in his only previous appearance as opener, Farbrace said: “You need to get these players in and let them do as much damage as possible. The great thing with him is that he is a not a slogger. He is a proper stroke-player with strong shots.”Buttler’s role, which owes much to the five successive half-centuries he made there for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League this year, means the Jason RoyJonny Bairstow axis that dominated Australia in the ODIs is broken up, with the latter expected to drop to a flexible middle‑order slot.Alex Hales has opened for all 52 of his Twenty20 internationals, has three of England’s four highest scores in the format and is their sole centurion to date. He will likely move to No\u0026nbsp3, with Joe Root, one of those to regularly miss out under the rest policy, coming in before Morgan and Bairstow.The Test captain is desperate to prove his case in the shortened format, of course, having previously expressed a fear he may fall behind. But Farbrace is confident Root’s classic style can still adapt, as was shown when his 43-ball 83 helped chase down 230 against South Africa in the 2016 World T20.“That was as good as any T20 innings we have seen in the last few years,” Farbrace said. “You don’t have to keep hitting sixes. You can hit fours as well and Rooty has shown he is quite capable. He has got he deft touches and flicks too. He is so adaptable.”Australia, who won a T20 tri-series against England and New Zealand during the winter, are under new captaincy. Tim Paine has left the tour and after 36 runs in five innings, is likely to have been a 50-over stop-gap. Aaron Finch, who leads here, would fancy that role but has respectfully played down his prospects.“If the opportunity came up it would be an honour,” he said. “But Tim is the captain right now and did a great job throughout the one-day series. It was disappointing we didn’t back up his leadership. We let ourselves slip.“The confidence was definitely affected, England put us on the back foot from the word go and we weren’t able to catch up. As a T20 team not a lot needs to be said, we have new faces to bring fresh energy – guys that have no baggage – and it’s a great opportunity to get out there and strut our stuff in a format we have had success in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36c547748da29e60312c62bcaab80894537d68e/136_214_3309_1987/master/3309.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe4107f05a6f89f9a4e2a14a76b81da","title":"uber case licence london","story":"Ride-hailing service impresses judge with sweeping changes to its practicesUber will be able to continue operating in London, after a court decided the ride-hailing firm should be awarded a new 15-month probationary licence, after being told of sweeping changes to its practices.The ride-hailing firm’s future in one of its biggest global markets had been in jeopardy after Transport for London ruled last September that it was not “fit and proper” to hold a private hire vehicles operator licence.At the start of a two-day hearing, Uber admitted that London’s original decision not to renew its five-year licence had been correct. TfL cited concerns about public safety and security, including a failure to report crimes or alleged crimes to the police, and to conduct proper background checks on drivers.But Uber’s lawyers convinced Westminster magistrates court that it had since cleaned up its act, while continuing to operate in the capital pending its appeal.The chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said Uber had not been a fit and proper firm but now, taking into account its new governance, she found it fit and proper to hold a licence. She said Uber should pay all costs of the appeal. TfL’s lawyer said a figure of £425,000 had been agreed.Uber’s lawyers told the court that after wholesale changes, and the appointment of new management in the UK to ensure full compliance with regulations, it had fully passed TfL’s three latest inspections.Changes include proactive reporting of serious incidents and ensuring drivers only operate in areas where they are licensed.TfL argued that Uber’s steps needed to be seen in the context of its past conduct, demanding a shorter licence than previously awarded. Helen Chapman, director of licensing regulation and charging at TfL, told the court that Uber had resisted regulation over the first five years of operation, and there had been “insufficient time” to see whether the firm had really changed. She said: “We’ve had five years of a very difficult relationship, where Uber has felt that it hasn’t required regulation.” She said it had been “frankly frustrating” that TfL was made aware of issues via the media rather than Uber.Lawyers for black-cab drivers had argued against licensing Uber. Gerald Gouriet QC, representing the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, warned that an “Uber in sheep’s clothing” had appeared before the court.Uber says it has around 3.6 million passengers regularly using its service in London, with 45,000 drivers. Speaking after the verdict, Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber in the UK, said: “We are pleased with today’s decision. We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “I believe everyone must play by the same rules, no matter how big or powerful they are. After years of operating poorly in London, Uber has now accepted that TfL’s action in refusing to renew their licence was totally justified. Today our stance has been vindicated by the court.“Uber has been put on probation – their 15-month licence has a clear set of conditions that TfL will thoroughly monitor and enforce. “As a result of us standing up for Londoners, Uber has been forced to overhaul the way it operates not just in London but across the world.”The chair of the London assembly’s transport committee, Caroline Pidgeon, said TfL would need to strongly enforce conditions, adding: “The safety of Londoners must come first and we will be keeping a close eye on the way Uber operates.”The San Francisco-based firm attempted to draw a line under past controversies with the appointment of a new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, last August, who said the company needed to change. Aside from the issues in London, Uber had been drawn into scandals including conduct in its head office, the treatment of staff, and allegations of using its software to evade regulators in other cities.Beyond compliance with London’s regulations, Uber has also offered some improved conditions for UK drivers, including limited insurance, limits on working hours and a 24-hour phone line for support.But it has continued to fight employment tribunal rulings giving rights to its so-called “partners”, leading to accusations of whitewashing rather than substantive change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f1eab27987af55caecce95d562a8e4c5754b0f/0_0_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=66196cf7cf78abe00540b3afa2ddb025 1400w","title":"eu hearing puts poland in dock over judicial changes","story":"Case is first time EU member state has been subject to hearing over strength of its democratic institutions Poland has been put in the dock by its fellow EU member states in an unprecedented hearing over the country’s alleged failure to respect democratic norms.In a move the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he deplored, France and Germany laid out the case against the country’s rightwing government during a meeting of ministers in Luxembourg.Three hours were set aside for the process, during which the Polish government was asked to respond to a series of questions over contentious changes to the country’s judiciary. There will be an assessment of Poland’s responses to the questions from the other 27 member states at a further meeting in July, along with a decision on the next steps, reporters were told after the hearing. It is the first time an EU member state has been subject to a hearing over the strength of its democratic institutions. The European commission launched its rule of law procedure against Poland in December over an alleged erosion of judicial independence under the ruling Law and Justice party.Under the terms of the so-called “nuclear option” of article 7 of the treaties, the procedure could ultimately result in Poland losing its EU voting rights, although Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has vowed to veto any such move.A potential vote, requiring a qualified majority of member states, could lead to the EU taking so-called “preventative measures” against Poland, if it was agreed that the Polish government posed a systemic risk to the bloc.The substance of those measures has yet to be spelled out, with commission sources admitting they were in unchartered territory.The Netherlands foreign minister, Stef Blok, said in Luxembourg: “The rule of law is one of the backbones of European cooperation, and there are a number of laws in Poland that raise questions.”Frans Timmermans, the commission’s vice president, who has repeatedly clashed with the Polish government over the issue, said: “We are in a new phase with a hearing and the inclusion of member states is extremely important.”After the hearing, Timmermans said he had not seen any change in the Polish position during a presentation given by delegation from Warsaw. He insisted the door for dialogue was still open for Poland, but that the EU needed to see fresh thinking. “I have not had any indication of that today,” he said. The Polish government, which came to power in 2015, claims it was merely seeking to reform a corrupt justice system that had failed to modernise in the 30 years since the fall of communism.The new laws additionally created a new “extraordinary appeal” chamber within the supreme court that could reopen cases from the previous 20 years on appeal from the prosecutor general, who is also the justice minister.Morawiecki said, however, his government had shown “goodwill and readiness for compromise” by making some amendments to its judicial reforms this year at the request of the commission.The Polish prime minister, speaking in Warsaw, said: “Our partners don’t understand what the post-communist reality looks like. The justice system had a problem with self-cleansing.”It is unclear how widely shared the commission’s concerns about Poland are among the EU member states.Arriving in Luxembourg, the UK’s minister in the room, Martin Callanan, expressed the British government’s belief that the commission should not be meddling in the domestic affairs of an EU member.Lord Callanan said: “We hope that the dialogue will continue and they will reach an agreement. We think dialogue is always best in these situations and we want to see a negotiated outcome.”However, Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said the defence of Europe’s democratic institutions was vital.He said: “We are not here to judge Poland or criticise Poland. We’re here to say that in Europe, the independence of the judiciary is sacred, so everything has to be done to protect it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab0161c42e7340c7e7a738548deda0e8b45fb75/0_270_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee088ea01eef6eff1c5cff14b610572","title":"yangtze at 100km intervals a photo essay","story":"Mother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraMother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraThe Yangtze river is usually celebrated by idealistic images of iconic places. But with Mother River, Yan Wang Preston wanted to undermine the deep-seated preference towards certain river places and their landscape representations. By selecting photographic sites at equally spaced locations, she did not necessarily produce a picturesque view. Instead, the project is filled with random landscapes that have rarely been photographed before. The project aims to tell a story of the entire width of China from its western highland to its eastern coast and demonstrates that in an era of abundant satellite mapping and saturated imagery, fresh views can still be created by a simple mapping exercise.“In modern China though, it is the Yangtze that has been promoted by the central government as the main national icon. This is to do with the Yangtze’s importance for China’s development. It provides the most important trade route into the wealthiest area of China. It is the physical and metaphorical frontline of China’s modernisation, with over 30 hydroelectric dams planned or constructed on it. It provides an analogy for China’s political unification as it is the longest river in China which ‘connects’ all the regions from Tibet to Shanghai. For all these reasons the Yangtze is in focus, and that’s why I wanted to work on it”“My journey began at 5,400m above sea level in the uninhabited zone known as the Tibetan Plateau. From here, the Yangtze river flows through majestic mountains with almost no access at all, before hitting the industrial lowland near Shanghai.”“Inhospitable terrain and huge distances made this project a modern-day adventure, with many potential hazards including high-altitude sickness, off-road driving, floods, sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides and mudslides.”“Not surprisingly, the process of realising the Mother River project wasn’t without incident. Two locations (Y15 \u0026amp Y16) remain unreached to this day, while 24 locations (Y39 - Y62) were originally depicted in poorly exposed images, because I loaded the films back-to-front by mistake. (I decided to re-shoot afterwards). It is precisely these imperfections that testify to the physicality of this highly conceptual project, and which also give it a particularly ‘human’ touch.”Yan Wang Preston is an award-winning British-Chinese artist. Mother River has won the Shiseido photography prize (Beijing, 2016) and Reviewers’ Choice Award at FORMAT (Derby, 2014). It was nominated for both the Prix Pictet award and The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d75dc8d2747c92e2cd3f8c5ab11cd5de0ea999/0_77_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc40fd4a11e87e8284bf5af03759cf3","title":"libya urges un to block oil sales after clashes between rival factions","story":"Move comes after strongman Khalifa Haftar takes control of key Gulf of Sirte oil terminals Libya’s oil industry – the sole reliable source of revenue for the strife-torn country – has been plunged into chaos after its United Nations-recognised government was forced to urge the UN to block any sales from its main oil terminals. The key terminals in the east of the country were captured from local militias last week by the so-called Libyan National Army, headed by strongman Khalifa Haftar. But on Tuesday Haftar announced his forces would send the revenues to a rival oil corporation in the country’s east rather than the UN-recognised National Oil Corporation (NOC).Haftar won control of the key oil terminals in the Gulf of Sirte from militia last week after 10 days of fierce fighting that left more than 300 people dead. The transfer of the ports, including Libya’s biggest, Es Sider, threatens to unsettle markets as purchasers are left struggling to identify legitimate Libyan traders. Haftar, the dominant figure on the east of the country, clearly feels he will benefit if the Tripoli-based government of national accord is starved of oil revenue. His decision threatens to deepen isions between the east and west of the country, and makes it hard for oil firms to know who to deal with. The clash will also complicate efforts by European leaders to reach agreements with Libya on controlling the flow of migrants through the country.The current populist surge in Europe has largely been fuelled by the three years of migration from Africa to Italy. The absence of political unity in Libya has made it easier for the traffickers to operate in the country. Muammar Gaddafi was ousted as president in 2011 after more than 40 years in power. But deep ision between his supporters and adversaries persisted. An internationally recognised National Transitional Council took over, but quickly succumbed to schism, particularly between east and west.The transitional authorities found it impossible to extend their writ across the whole country, which was splintering into myriad factions: former regime loyalists, revolutionary brigades, local militia, Islamists, old army units, tribes, people trafficking gangs.A General National Congress was elected in 2012 and established itself in Tripoli. But when a national parliament was elected in 2014, the GNC refused to accept the result the new body had to install itself in the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya now effectively had two governments - the former buttressed by Islamist militias in its Tripoli stronghold, the latter supported by Khalifa Haftar, a renegade army colonel now head of the armed forces.Libya has become too unsafe for diplomats and most aid workers. The UN pulled its staff out in 2014 and foreign embassies followed suit. Tripoli international airport is largely destroyed by fighting.The conflict has killed 5,000, ruined the economy, driven half a million from their homes and trapped hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to get north to Europe in a nightmarish network of brutal camps. Diplomatic attempts at reconciliation have proven fruitless thus far.Despite the turmoil, the Libyan National Oil Corporation, headed by Mustafa Sanalla, had managed to remain largely above the political fray, and gradually brought production back up to nearly 1m barrels per day – helping to finance the UN-recognised government which controls the west of the country.Outside governments are ided over whether to back Haftar – whose LNA is a coalition of military unites and local militias – or the Tripoli-based government of national accord, which is recognised by the UN. Many had hoped that presidential elections scheduled for December might bring about reconciliation. The Tripoli government said: “Handing over oil terminals to an illegitimate entity only exacerbates the ision.”Sanalla said: “UN security council resolutions are very clear oil facilities, production, and exports must remain under the exclusive control of NOC and the sole oversight of the government of national accord. We are confident that the GNA and our international partners will take the necessary steps to stop all exports in breach of international law.”He added: “Libyans want a country of laws, not of guns. Instead of defending the rule of law in Libya by handing the Gulf of Sirte ports over to the operational control of the legitimate and internationally recognised NOC, the Libyan National Army has decided to put itself above the law.”Leaders from east and west of the country had met in Paris to agree a timetable to stage elections this December, but Sanalla said “the LNA has turned its back on the Paris accords and on the path to peace”. Sanalla also said it would sue any company that tried to buy oil from the eastern authorities and that no purchase contract signed with them would be honoured.Claudia Gazzini, the Crisis Group’s senior Libya analyst, said that Haftar’s decision not to hand over the oil terminals to the NOC could reignite wider conflict in Libya."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2254bc920c45c6a61dbec4c77b03618208a2974f/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34b884fd952a36ef1ec5c81b295fd635","title":"north korea nuclear reactor upgrades summit pledges","story":"Monitoring group says work shows why a denuclearisation deal rather than a ‘statement of lofty goals’ is neededNorth Korea has continued to upgrade its only known nuclear reactor used to fuel its weapons program, satellite imagery has shown, despite ongoing negotiations with the US and a pledge to denuclearise.Infrastructure improvements at the Yongbyon nuclear plant are “continuing at a rapid pace”, according to an analysis by monitoring group 38 North of commercial satellite images taken on 21 June.The cooling system for the plutonium production reactor has been modified and at least two new non-industrial buildings have been built on the site, possibly for use by visiting officials. A new engineering office building has been completed and construction has continued on support facilities throughout the complex, according to a blog post written by Frank V Pabian, Joseph S Bermudez Jr and Jack Liu.The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has committed to “complete denuclearisation” in meetings with Donald Trump and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, but the details of how and when that will happen have not yet been decided. Kim announced earlier this year the the North’s nuclear arsenal and weapons capable of striking the US were complete, and the North closed its only known nuclear test site in May.“Infrastructure improvements continue at Yongbyon,” Jenny Town, managing editor of 38 North, wrote on Twitter. “Underscores reason why an actual deal is necessary, not just a statement of lofty goals.”The status of various parts of the nuclear complex remains unclear, and experts cautioned linking ongoing improvements to negotiations with the US.“Continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearise,” the experts warned. “The North’s nuclear cadre can be expected to proceed with business as usual until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang.”Despite the lack of clarity on any nuclear deal, South Korea has pushed ahead with diplomatic efforts. The two sides met for military talks this week aimed at restoring communication lines, and railway officials agreed to explore connecting the two countries by rail.Checks will begin next month on long-unused lines that once allowed travel across the entire peninsula. Talks began a decade ago, but were suspended amid rising tensions. South Korea already has a gleaming steel and glass station just south of its highly militarised border with the North, with tracks marked for service to the North’s capital, Pyongyang.Kim singled out the South’s advanced railway infrastructure during his meeting with Moon in April, acknowledging in a rare admission of weakness that the North lagged far behind its neighbour.

Photograph: Eric LukeMinister for Justice Charlie Flanagan secured Cabinet approval on Tuesday to lift the restrictions placed on asylum seekers working, including the abolishment of the €1,000 payment for an employment permit.The proposals, which will be announced on Wednesday by Mr Flanagan and Minister of State David Staunton, come a year after the Supreme Court found the ban on asylum seekers working in this country was unconstitutional.According to the current rules, asylum seekers must secure a job that pays a starting salary of at least €30,000 per year, and may not work in any of 60 different sectors, including in hospitality, food, healthcare, social work, childcare, marketing, administration, textiles, printing, housekeeping and construction.It is understood Mr Flanagan will relax this system and will allow for broad access to occupations and easier access to work permits. The Minister for Justice will also be in charge of granting such permits.A Government source said the decision to deny access to the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Civil Service was due to the permanency of the positions.“It is not clear whether all asylum seekers will become permanent residents and therefore until that is clear, they will not be in a position to work in those three sectors. However, they will be able to work elsewhere.”Access to social welfare payments will also be permitted to those who find employment. Currently, asylum seekers living in direct provision have a weekly allowance of €21.60 and can buy food using a recently introduced points system.Figures show 5,096 people were living in direct provision in December 2017.Many have been in the system awaiting a decision on their future for years.The old scheme, which will remain in force until a full work-permit system is drawn up for asylum seekers, has been strongly criticised by advocates. Not one work permit has been issued since the ban was lifted.Last year, the Supreme Court heard a case from a Burmese man who had spent eight years in direct provision before getting refugee status. He won his appeal over laws preventing him working in Ireland before his status was decided.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3544867.1530042960!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain needs a deal ireland needs a deal eu needs a deal coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney would not be drawn on whether the latest UK plan to extend the backstop’s provisions to the whole of the UK was a basis for negotiation. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe EU summit on Friday will again give broad approval to the union’s Brexit negotiating strategy while expressing regret at the lack of progress on Ireland and urging the British to urgently make clear what they want.EU member states’ Brexit ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday night gave the nod to a set of draft conclusions for the summit.Echoing previous comments from the European Commission’s negotiating task force, the leaders will make explicit to the UK their willingness to move the EU position and “reconsider its offer” if the UK reconsiders its so-called red lines. These are membership of the customs union and the single market.However, the draft conclusions insist on the need for “intensified efforts” in the talks, with “further clarity from the UK as regards its position on the future relationship”.They will express “concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland”.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney would not be drawn on whether the latest UK plan to extend the backstop’s provisions to the whole of the UK was a basis for negotiation.“At the moment,” he said, “the EU has a legally operable and viable backstop proposal...the British government has rejected that proposal, but has not come up with an alternative that is viable, and that’s what they need to do.”Ahead of the ministerial meeting Mr Coveney met EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier for an hour-long discussion, “both of us making it very clear that we’re on the same page”.Mr Coveney said they had discussed progressing the talks over the summer in considerable detail, focussing on citizens’ rights in the North, the Border and “future relationship” issues.He pointed to undertakings that had already been given by British prime minister Theresa May in the context of preserving the Belfast Agreement.“As far as I’m concerned the commitments the British prime minister has made in terms of protecting the Good Friday agreement, ensuring there would be no Border infrastructure post-Brexit, and even the language in her recent speech where she says she rules out any physical Border infrastructure or related controls on the island of Ireland ... she also says very pointedly that some people in Britain suggest that if we don’t put a border in place and then it’s up to the EU to do it if they want.“She makes it very clear that that’s a nonsense argument, that actually Britain is the one leaving and there’s a responsibility on Britain to find a solution here. These are comments I think that are relevant whether or not there’s a withdrawal treaty text agreed.“But having said that, I think we will agree a withdrawal treaty text. I think a no-deal Brexit is very, very unlikely, and that there is perhaps too much talk about it and grandstanding about it. Britain needs a deal.

Mr Harris is currently the Deputy Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The Government expects newly appointed Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to recruit his own leadership team when he takes up his position later this year.It is a sea change for the Garda to have a leader from another jurisdiction and it is the first time in its history, but political sources said Mr Harris’s profile as someone from outside but with close knowledge of the force made him ideal for the role. The Garda has suffered from years of controversy over various scandals, with the last two commissioners retiring abruptly.Government figures said they expected and were “hopeful” Mr Harris would recruit his own team to assist him with his new position. All resources would be made available to ensure that happened, one stressed. However, this is likely to be contentious for many within the Garda force.The selection process was independent of Government, but Ministers enthusiastically welcomed the move on Tuesday with Mr Varadkar hailing the appointment from the steps of Government Buildings. The Cabinet yesterday ratified the appointment of Mr Harris, who is currently the Deputy Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, nine months after the departure of former commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan from the role.Mr Harris will replace Acting Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin, who will be retiring from the force in September. Mr Harris will be paid a salary of €250,000.Speaking after the appointment was confirmed, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar defended the decision to appoint an outsider to the role and to oversee the State’s national security.Mr Varadkar insisted Mr Harris would be “loyal to the police and loyal to the State” and would steer policing in the right direction.“It is a good moment for Irish policing, it is an opportunity for new leadership and for policing for the community,” Mr Varadkar added.On taking up the post, Mr Harris will be required to make a solemn declaration under section 16 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 including to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the State.Mr Harris is entitled to dual Irish and British citizenship because he was born in Northern Ireland, and a Government spokesman confirmed he had applied for an Irish passport.Mr Harris was one of five iniduals in the final round of interviews for the role. Assistant Commissioner Leahy and Deputy Commissioner Twomey were the only two internal candidates to make through to the last stage of the competition.The others were based in Scotland and England. However it is understood one of those withdrew from the process in recent weeks.Mr Harris has served principally in Northern Ireland, including 12 years in senior leadership roles. He has served as Deputy Chief Constable since 2014, where he is believed to worked closely with the British security services.His father, also an RUC officer, was killed in an IRA car bomb in 1989. His mother survived the attack with minor injuries.Garda sources said Mr Harris would be a target for dissident Republicans, whose stated aim has been to attack the security services of Northern Ireland.A security assessment will be carried out around Mr Harris and his routine as commissioner and additional precautions would be put in place, the sources said.This was likely to include security measures, including armed gardaí, around where he will live when in Dublin and also around his travel between the Republic and the North. His travelling around the Republic in the course of his work as Garda Commissioner would also be security profiled and addition security precautions put in place.Some Garda sources believed his plans to attend some events would not be publicised in the open way the plans of previous commissioners have been.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3544621.1530029006!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british and european business and union leaders unite in call for brexit progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s foreign secretary Boris Johnson arriving  for a cabinet meeting at Downing Street.

They urged British and EU negotiators to make faster progress on finalising the Withdrawal Agreement and to put economic interests and jobs first.“We are calling on the UK government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland,” they said.“The UK government and the EU will need to agree on all aspects of regulatory alignment, which is of the utmost importance, without jeopardising the integrity of the single market. This must involve preserving value chains and avoiding non-tariff barriers to trade finding a solution for intra-corporate transfer (ICT) arrangements barrier-free and frictionless trade in goods and services and a mechanism for agreeing a mutually acceptable level playing field for workers’ rights.”The unprecedented joint statement from the general secretaries of the British Trade Union Congress and the European Trade Union Confederation and the directors general of the Confederation of British Industry and Business Europe came ahead of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels this week.It follows warnings from manufacturers including Airbus and BMW about the consequences of a no-deal exit, and an assertion by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday that investment in the British car industry had halved because of uncertainty over Brexit.In a speech to chief executives in London on Tuesday, Theresa May said her government had listened to business throughout the Brexit process despite recent remarks by ministers\u0026nbspcriticising companies for warning about the dangers of a poor deal or no deal at all. In the House of Commons, foreign secretary Boris Johnson did not deny saying “f**k business” at a meeting recently but implied that he was referring to lobbyists.“I don’t think anybody can doubt the passionate support of this government for business. It may be that I have from time to time expressed scepticism about some of those who profess to speak up for business,” he said.In their joint statement ahead of this week’s summit, the unions and business leaders called on both sides in the negotiations to consult them more and to put prosperity before politics.“Employers and unions have already developed a consensus on issues such as the need to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, and the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. We are calling on the UK and EU to consult us in a meaningful and more structured manner on a joint basis so that we can contribute to identifying and designing practical solutions that will work,” they said.“The cost of disagreement between the UK and the EU would be dire for firms, workers and the communities where they live. Amid uncertain times we appeal to negotiators on both sides to put jobs and prosperity before politics when seeking solutions that will matter for generations to come.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

including murder, rape, torture, burning and forced starvation – perpetrated by Myanmar’s security forces in villages across northern Rakhine State was not the action of rogue soldiers or units,” said Amnesty senior crisis adviser, Matthew Wells.“There is a mountain of evidence that this was part of a highly orchestrated, systematic attack on the Rohingya population.”Amnesty adds to calls for the situation in Burma to be referred to the International Criminal Court in the Hague for investigation and prosecution. A similar demand was made by the House of Commons International Development Select Committee in May.  Meanwhile, last week the court’s judges gave Burma a July 27 deadline to respond to a request by prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, that they consider hearing a case on the alleged deportation of Rohingya minorities to Bangladesh. Among Amnesty’s latest evidence, collected on both sides of the Burma-Bangladesh border, is an audio recording, which it believes to be a telephone call between a Rohingya resident of the village of Inn Din and a Burmese military officer. In the recording, the officer says, in Burmese: “We got an order to burn down the entire village if there is any disturbance. If you villagers aren’t living peacefully, we will destroy everything… We are starting the operation… If you just stay quiet, there will be no problems. If not, you will all be in danger.”  Inn Din was the site of one of the worst known massacres during the 2017 army operation. In an earlier chilling report, Amnesty revealed that vigilantes and the military had looted and burned homes and shot people as they fled. The army has consistently denied charges of ethnic cleansing, made among others by the United Nations, but in April it did sentence seven soldiers to ten years of hard labour for their role in the slaughter of ten Rohingya men at Inn Din. The new Amnesty report, citing confidential military documents as evidence, accuses the very top of Burma’s military command - the office of the commander-in-chief, or War Office - of having been actively engaged in overseeing operations during which crimes against humanity were committed. “Senior officials from the War Office physically went to Rakhine State in the lead up to 25 August and in the weeks that followed. Among them was Senior General Min Aung Hlaing himself, who travelled to the region from 19-21 September 2017 to be briefed on the operations,” alleges Amnesty. It claims that senior officials would also have been involved in the deployment of air assets such as helicopters, which appear to be linked to serious crimes, and that some of the fiercest fighting battalions were deployed front and centre of the operation. Senior military officials knew, or should have known, that crimes against humanity were being committed, yet failed to prevent it, claims the group. Existing evidence warrants an investigation into whether some or all may have been directly involved in planning, ordering or committing murder, rape, torture and the burning of villages, it adds. Among the atrocities detailed in the report are massacres and gangrapes in the villages of Chut Pyin, Min Gyi and Maung Nu. Rohingya refugees face deadly landslides during monsoon rains in Bangladeshi campsOne woman who was raped by soldiers in a school told Amnesty that when she emerged from the building she saw many dead bodies. Men and boys also told Amnesty investigators of how they had been tortured to the point of death by security forces. The report also expands on alleged abuses by the armed insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which sparked the military crackdown by launching coordinated attacks on security posts. An Amnesty report in May already revealed how ARSA had reportedly also killed people from different ethnic and religious communities in northern Rakhine state.  Please

urban, village and rural environments and found numbers are roughly three times healthier in built-up areas than in the country.The researchers at Holloway University believe predators, agricultural pesticides and a reduction of food in rural areas mean city gardens and other green spaces have now become safer and more nutritious for bees than their traditional habitats.The crucial pollinators are under significant strain, partly due to the intensification of arable farming.But there has been an increase in the number of urban beehives as more people take up beekeeping as a hobby.How to help bees in your gardenThe team captured 176 foraging queens from Windsor Great Park in Surrey and then reintroduced them across 114 sites in London and the South East.They found the numbers of sexual offspring, the size of food stores, and ability to avoid parasite invasion was all improved in towns.Published in the Royal Society Journal, the 10-week study is believed to be the first to show a species to demonstrate a direct relationship between ubranisation and reproductive success.“Reductions in forage availability in modern agricultural landscapes have been identified as a potential major driver of bee population declines,” the authors wrote.“Accordingly, we found less stored pollen and nectar in agricultural colonies than in city or village colonies, suggesting forage availability may be a contributing factor to poor performance at agricultural sites.”Last month it was announced an insect “road network” should be created throughout Britain to protect species such as bees, butterflies and moths from decline.The Ministry of Justice and The Environment Agency are already working with the charity Buglife to identify sites such as prisons, seawalls and floodplains where they could create wildflower habitats.Please review our commenting policySenior US Democrat suffers shock defeat to political novice as party\u0026#39s splits exposedDavid Beckham joins Duke and

them.So what better way to remember the Routemaster than building a replica model of the iconic double-decker?Except that you would be waiting some time for this particular bus to arrive and it would cost you a deal more than a single fare to Oxford Circus.The advertising standards watchdog has banned a series of adverts promoting the chance to build the replica after it emerged it would take two years to complete , at a cost of more than £1,150.An image from the online for the Routemaster replica modelThe television and website adverts for the Classic Routemaster magazine stated that the first issue, which contained the miniature parts to build its famous curved bonnet, were on sale for the special price of just £1.99.However, not only would the second edition of the magazine cost £4.99, but in order to complete the bus modelling fans would have to buy a total of 130 weekly issues at a subsequent cost of £8.99 each.That meant it would take two-and-a-half years to build the replica, which at 70cm long and 20cm high is 12 times smaller than a real Routemaster.What’s more, the cost of buying each issue of the magazine containing all the necessary parts, including working headlights, removable fuel cap, die-cast metal engine and even a \u0027stop the bus\u0027 bell, would have come to a total of £1,157.70.Detail of the engine for the Routemaster replica modelThe TV advert, aired in January, showed a completed replica, with a voice-over stating: Remember the world famous Routemaster? Now you can build your own authentic replica Routemaster. Engineered with exceptional detail including working lights and bell.Week by week follow simple instructions to construct this iconic bus. Build the Routemaster. Issue one just £1.99.During the TV ad, white text appeared on the top right-hand side of the screen, stating “130 issues. Usual price £8.99”.Eight people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the adverts, which were still running online yesterday, were misleading since it was not made “sufficiently” clear that you would have to buy 130 editions of the magazine, with 128 editions at a \u0027normal price\u0027 of £8.99.Model fans said they were left bewildered by the cost of completing the replica.One, calling himself Martyn, complained: Good God! it\u0027s £1,157 - you could by a real one for that!The total cost of building the replica model - which has working headlights, removable fuel cap and even a \u0026#39stop the bus\u0026#39 bell - came to  £1,157.70A model maker calling themselves Victoria Line wrote: I was really excited by the advert on telly - a project during the dark, winter evenings - but I could buy a little run about car for that money.”Another, called Frank, wrote: £1,157 - at that price I would expect it to start taking fares.The ASA has now banned the advert for being misleading, saying that the on-screen text \u0027130 issues. Usual price £8.99\u0027 was “not sufficiently prominent and likely to have been overlooked by consumers”.It stated: “The text was placed in the top right-hand corner of the ad, which may have been overlooked by viewers. Furthermore, the text was in a significantly smaller font than the £1.99 price claim and was not referenced by the voice-over, which instead referenced the £1.99 cost of the first issue.”The ASA added: Because the ad did not make sufficiently clear the total number of magazines consumers had to purchase and did not make clear the normal selling price of the magazine, we concluded that the ad was misleading.”Hachette Partwork, which produced the magazines, said it was “made clear” on its website that it would take 130 editions to complete the model - and that customers could get their money back if not satisfied.The front-engined AEC Routemaster first appeared in February 1956 and ran until it was withdrawn from service in December 2005. The following year it was voted one of Britain\u0027s top 10 design icons alongside Concorde, the Mini, the Spitfire and London’s tube map.One Routemaster heritage route still operates in central

snitch list reactionary grass blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The motion was backed by\u0026nbspall the mainstream centre right, centre left, liberals, Greens and left-wingers on the committee.Conservative Home Affairs spokesman Daniel Dalton MEP, who voted against recommending the triggering of Article 7, attacked the “one sided” criticism of Hungary and said the EU should stay out of “domestic political controversies”.“Article 7 should only be used as a very last resort on strictly legal grounds upon the decision of the European Council and the European Commission,” he said.This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left.\u0026nbsp“The extremely one sided report I voted against today was an inappropriate attempt by the European parliament to insert itself into domestic political battles.\u0026nbsp“Recent attempts to raise domestic controversies to a European level are both wrong and counter-productive, alienating many citizens who feel their countries are being unfairly targeted by the European institutions.”Hungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, was quick to reciprocate the Conservatives\u0027 support in Brussels, breaking ranks from other EU countries and telling the Daily Mail: “If we are not able to come to a deal with a country that represents 14 per cent – or one seventh – of our economy, that would lead to a situation that would be very devastating for the EU.”Hungary considering making offering food to refugees illegalHungarian government plans powers to ban NGOs that help migrantsWhy Hungary and Poland are turning away from democracyHow Orban is destroying democracy in HungaryMr Szijjarto, a leading member of Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, went on the BBC’s Newsnight programme the same day to defend his country’s record.\u0026nbspAsked whether he stood by Mr Orban’s claim that refugees were “Muslim invaders” bringing terrorism to Europe and that his policy was based on xenophobia, he said: “Calling a country xenophobic is an insult, especially if you put it into consideration Hungary. No one can take away the right to decide with whom we would like to live together.\u0026nbsp“Yes, it is our intention to keep Hungary a Hungarian country and yes we do not agree with those ones who say that multiculturalism is by definition good.” He added that he stood by “of course all the statements of my prime minister”.Following the recommendation to trigger Article 7 against Hungary by the MEP committee the issue will now be voted on by all MEPs. Given the broad support amongst the largest political groups in the parliament it is expected to pass.Sophie Int Veld, a senior liberal MEP, criticised the Tories’ decision to back Hungary, warning: “This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left.\u0026nbsp“On the one hand calling for sanctions against Putin, on the other hand supporting one of his closest allies in the EU.\u0026nbsp Even Conservative governments of the recent past were always promoters of democracy and the rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe, but in providing cover for Orban’s descent to authoritarianism, they have today trampled on this legacy.\u0026nbsp“Prime Minister May tells us she will stand up for the international rules based order and for a stable, democratic and secure Europe, but in reality she is jumping into bed with Viktor Orban’s destructive vision of illiberal democracy. Voting with Orban is the true Tory Brexit: the exit from European values. A sad day.”She added: “Today the European parliament has sent a strong message to Viktor Orban and those who wish to spread his illiberal vision the European Union will defend its values.”Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

To participate in the state’s primary you must have registered by 5 June. To vote in partisan races, voters had to register as a Democrat or Republican, but other party affiliated voters can cast ballots in nonpartisan races such as those for school boards.\u0026nbspPolling places can be looked up on the Board of Elections site.\u0026nbspThere are several online voting guides to help familiarise voters with issues before heading into the booth. A valid form of identification is required and can be in the form of a state driver’s license, state issued ID card, passport, student or military ID. A current utility bill or pay stub listing your name and address also works. Those without identification can request a provisional ballot, which will be counted once the information is verified. Incumbent Governor Larry Hogan is running for a second term at the helm this year. Though a Republican, he is considered a moderate and worked to put distance between himself and Donald Trump on issues like healthcare and gun control. His popularity is a pleasant surprise for a state that is considered to be largely Democrat and has voted that way for decades in presidential elections. Going against Mr Hogan are eight Democrats. Perhaps the best-known candidate is Ben Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People\u0026nbsp(NAACP). He has managed to get endorsement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and is seen as the progressive challenger to established Democrats in the state, part of a national movement this year to make the party more erse, inclusive, and less reliant on corporate contributions which wield influence. However, candidate Rushern Baker polled at a relatively close second. The official from Prince George’s county, which borders the eastern half of Washington DC, has won the endorsement of former Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and is seen as having closer ties to the establishment wing of the party. While Maryland is seen as a reliably blue\u0026nbspstate, there is one red\u0026nbspRepublican pocket and Democrats are looking to change that in voting booths along the Eastern Shore part of the state. Andy Harris has been the Republican Representative in the US House for eight years and has not faced a real challenge in that time. Unlike other parts of the state, the Eastern Shore is predominately white and voted for Mr Trump by 29 per cent in the 2016 election. What Mr Harris faces now is not just his vote against Obamacare, and that only 26 per cent of Maryland voters are registered Republicans, but also that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made his seat a target and throwing political weight behind challengers like Jesse Colvin, a former Army intelligence officer, who has raised a large amount of money. Five other Democrats are challenging Mr Colvin for the nomination.

As far as Senate seats go, well-established Democratic Senator Ben Cardin is running for re-election. Mr Cardin is expected to win, taking 61 per cent in a recent poll, but is still being challenged by first-time candidate Chelsea Manning. The former US Army intelligence analyst who was convicted in 2013 for the largest leak of classified information in history moved to Rockville after Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Though\u0026nbspattention focused on her Senate bid, she has not been able to challenge Mr Cardin’s $4m in contributions and 30 years of experience. Voter turnout in primaries promises to be high across the board, but particularly for Democrats as tensions with Mr Trump and the Republicans grows every day. “Democrats are energised and they’re ready to send a message,” said Fabion Seaton, a spokesman for the Maryland Democratic Party, speaking to the Baltimore Sun. Amid Democrat calls to abolish ICE, one promises to propose a lawNew wave candidates seeks to make Democratic Party more progressive Michael Bloomberg wants to bankroll Democrats to 2018 victoryEarly voting has seen a 55 per cent increase in turnout over the 2014 primaries, the last non-presidential election. As of last week, more than 170,000 voters had already cast early ballots, but experts warn this is not an indicator of winners since early voting is usually pushed far more by Democrats than Republicans.After the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration failed to send updated voter rolls to the Board of Elections, almost 19,000 voters are required to fill out provisional ballots in order to participate in the primaries. The agencies called it a “computer programming error” affecting any voters who updated their addresses between 22 April 2017 and 5 June 2018, as the Washington Post reported.In total 18,700 changed their addresses and 7,300 changed their party affiliation. There are efforts to contact all voters impacted by the error, but concerns were raised since the problem was discovered only three days before the primary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I feel like I can do anything,” Bayan al Soumady says over the phone from Riyadh. The excitement in her voice is infectious.\u0026nbsp“I drove myself to work today.\u0026nbspMaybe it’s just a little thing, but everything feels like an adventure now.”The 24-year-old pharmacist is one of thousands of women across Saudi Arabia who took to the road for the first time on Sunday after the kingdom abolished its long-standing ban on women driving.\u0026nbspAs the clock struck midnight, in a show of solidarity and celebration, women did victory laps around the centres of Riyadh, Jeddah and\u0026nbspDammam,\u0026nbsptrailed by Saudi television crews and the rest of the world’s media.Throughout Sunday – the first day of the Saudi working week – women who had already managed to convert their foreign driving licences\u0026nbspstepped into newly purchased cars, or borrowed those belonging to fathers and husbands, to commute to work and run errands alone. Some headed out of the cities on the long, straight desert roads to drive fast for the pleasure of it.\u0026nbsp“Life can feel very complicated here sometimes,” says\u0026nbspBayan, who is half Syrian and learned to drive while\u0026nbspstudying in Damascus.\u0026nbsp“It’s frustrating not being able to rely on yourself for simple things like going to the supermarket 10 minutes away. I know it doesn’t fix everything – but being able to drive is a big step,” she adds.The historic moment gives women unprecedented freedom in a country where the male ship system effectively renders them second-class citizens, unable to make many important decisions for themselves.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia’s tiny activist community has fought against the ban since it was enforced by police and licensing agencies in 1990. A surprise royal decree from King Salman last September, however,\u0026nbspannounced the end of a policy which has been perhaps the foremost symbol of the oppression faced by women in the conservative kingdom. The move, designed to help get more\u0026nbspwomen into the Saudi workforce, is part of a raft of wide-ranging social and economic reforms installed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspin the year since his appointment.\u0026nbspSaudi Women celebrate their freedom to driveA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTo hammer home the message that change in Saudi Arabia comes from the top down, in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban 17 prominent activists have been arrested. Eight are still being held without access to their families or lawyers, and no charges have been brought against them.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, many ordinary Saudis embraced what one national newspaper called “history in the making”. \u0026nbsp“The logistics of half a country suddenly being able to learn to drive are quite something,” Susan Newbon, a British driving instructor training Saudi women to teach their own students, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a very strange but very important occasion.”\u0026nbspSome women will have to wait a while to get behind the wheel\u0026nbspthere are huge waiting lists for gender-segregated lessons across the country, and a course of classes can cost hundreds of dollars.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in. And there’s never been a better moment for her to do it than now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Italy is also expected to join too.Today Theresa May was urged to boost Britains defence budget to £60billion a year to convince the US to stay in Nato.The powerful Commons Defence committee warned that UK forces cant be a useful ally of the US without a cash boost from the Treasury.Meanwhile, Brussels has insisted that Britain will lose security perks after we quit the bloc next year.The UK will be excluded from key partnerships such as the European Arrest Warrant and EU crime databases, the EUs chief Brexit negotiator has said, but said we will still cooperate strongly to fight terror and cyber attacks.But his comments prompted a firm intervention from the GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming, who revealed that vital intelligence from Britain has helped foil four terror plots against Europe in the last year.He said the UK had played a critical role - firing a warning shot to Brussels bosses who say they will boot us from working together after were gone.After discussions at Nato headquarters, he said: We’ve played a critical role in the disruption of terrorist operations in at least four European countries in the past year.

I never took a gap year and Id always fancied doing a bit of travelling - and what destination could be more adventurous than the final frontier?It only took a few hours before I heard back with the good news - Im in, which means I can vote on the direction of Asgardias future and, hopefully, be eligible to leave the planet one day when Asgardias first space expeditions get off the ground.Citizens from over 200 territories have applied to become Asgardians, and its current citizen count makes it the 172nd largest country in the world.Within 10 years, Asgardias leaders hope to have recruited 150 million people, and the dream is that the first ark - a satellite like the International Space Station - will be able to launch within a few decades time.So far, the nation hasnt put anyone in space, but it has launched its own unmanned satellite, Asgardia-1, which is currently deployed in low-Earth orbit, moving at speeds of 7.6km per second.Next up, the country plans to establish its own digital currency, dubbed the solar, and bigger upcoming projects include designing a protective shield to guard humankind from space debris and asteroids.So far, the UN hasnt let Asgardia into the club of Earth-dwelling nations, but the nations founder says he is in informal talks with a few heads of state to get Asgardia recognised as a real country.Asgardia is the brainchild of Dr Igor Ashurbeyli, a billionaire Russian-Azerbaijani businessman and scientist who was formally inaugurated as Asgardias head of state at a grand ceremony at Viennas Hofburg Palace on Monday.Bizarrely, he was sworn in by former partner of Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia, Lembit Opik - a keen advocate of space exploration and one of Asgardias most high profile citizens.While his terrestrial political career is long over, Opik has been successfully elected to one of the 150 seats on the Asgardian parliament, along with Nigel Evans, President of the British Parliamentary Space Committee.“Today, it’s time to open space up economically, socially and culturally for all humankind, Opik says. That’s Asgardia’s mission.”“As the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the country is liberated to invest in a truly global space community, and the Government has recognised this with substantial investment in the UK space sector.“Asgardia welcomes British citizens who share the dream of human opportunities in space for all countries, not just the privileged few who can afford a presence in space.There was a time when only the British Upper Class could travel abroad. Now it’s possible for all to do it.Ashurbeyli fears Earth will soon be destroyed by environmental degradation or a catastrophic nuclear war, and so he thinks its important that humanity can leave the planet before its too late.As such, he wants to start again with his own country and put space politics over geopolitics... a grand ambition which he has bankrolled entirely on his own so far.A qualified engineer, Azerbaijan-born Dr Igor Ashurbeyli made his fortune in a string of successful tech businesses.His exact net worth is not known, but its widely reported that Ashurbeyli is comfortably in the billionaire club.He founded software company Socium in 1988, before moving to Moscow to work with a string of military and scientific companies.Hes previously worked as a consultant for the UN, advising on how to protect Earth from asteroids and space threats, and he has edited an international space journal, ROOM, since 2014.Space has been a lifelong passion, and hes poured his own money into Asgardia, which he formally founded around 20 months ago.  In the future, he plans on charging a 100 euro annual citizenship fee, as well as collecting income and business taxes from members, to sustain the grand and expensive Asgardian dream.There are also plans to one day vet citizens by IQ, but at this point it looks like Asgardia will take anyone they can get, so long as theyre committed to a future away from our planet.The timeline for leaving Earth behind? Just 25 years, by which time Ashurbeyli hopes to establish a permanent human settlement on the moon.In the meantime, hes trying to find some political backing for Asgardia on the world stage, and iron out pesky admin stuff... like actually building life-supporting arks and getting millions of people into space.“This day will certainly be recorded in the annals of the greatest events in the history of humankind,” he said in his inaugural speech.“We have thus established all branches of government. I can therefore declare with confidence that Asgardia – the first space nation of the united humankind – has been born.”Asgardia may be slowly heading towards recognition as an official country, but theres still a long way to go. Its probably safe to say that we dont need to worry about facing them in the group stages of the World Cup any time soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we approached the beach she took her shoes off just like any other kid would at a beach and I was taking the bags off the buggy.She continued: My friend had come with their dog.

He said: If they had involved us, our heritage department would have liaised with the regional government and got advice over the best way of handling the restoration.The mayor also complained that there was in general a lack of control over the Churchs heritage, which should be in the hands of public administration.He added that churches received money from the public and that there was a need for greater control to ensure something like this never happens again.Carmen Usua, who works for art restoration company ArtUs, shared details of the vandalism of the statue on social networks and claimed that it looks like a ninot (a cardboard sculpture typical of the Fallas festival in Valencia).She said the restoration had involved covering any cracks in the statue using plaster and then painting it with a totally new colour scheme that bore no resemblance to the original subtle colouring of the 16th-Century artist.She added: The livery of the horse was originally coloured silver with subtle gold lines and although dirty, it was not lost and could have been recovered with careful restoration. Instead everything has been covered in red paint in an act of vandalism that defies belief.Miguel Zuza, a member of the Navarre Council of Culture, told local media that this statue had the typical characteristics of a gentleman of the 15th or early 16th Century. Now it has been butchered and looks like a carousel figure.Saint George was born between 256-285 A.D and he died on April 23, 303.Since his exact birth date was never determined it is unclear how old he was when he died.According to legend he is said to have slain a dragon that was terrorising a town in modern day Libya.Many of the townsfolk were being killed by the dragon so they started feeding it two sheep a day to appease it.When the town ran out of sheep, legend has it that the king devised a lottery system to feed the hungry dragon local children instead.But, one day his own daughter was chosen and as she was being led down to the lake Saint George happened to ride past.The story goes that George offered to slay the dragon  but only if the people converted to Christianity.They did, and the king later built a church where the dragon was slain.His feast day is celebrated on April 23, the anniversary of his death."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416316727.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm told to end freedom of movement","story":"In its strongest attack yet, Migration Watch demanded the PM get on with publishing plans to slash low-skilled immigration from the EU.And they urged her to separate immigration policy from trade talks amid fears the PM will give way on border controls to gain greater access to the single market.They said it defied belief Brits were still in the dark about the Government’s immigration policy just nine months out from Brexit Day.Migration Watch said the Government could offer visas to highly-skilled EU workers, brickies and agricultural workers and still cut 80 per cent of migration from the Continent.Lord Green, the think tank’s chair, stormed: “These proposals comprise a clear way forward on immigration that would benefit all sides.“The government must not let immigration get mired in trade negotiations. “They should stop dithering and get on with it so that people in companies know where they stand.”The attack came as Business Secretary Greg Clark admitted the Cabinet had not yet even discussed what a post-Brexit immigration policy should look like.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An interactive poll of the audience prior to the PM\u0027s arrival revealed that 37% of them were \"not very confident\" about the UK economy, compared with 35% who were neutral and just 27% who claimed to be \"reasonably confident\".Asked what posed the biggest threat to the UK economy, some 62% had highlighted a collapse of inward investment or a collapse in investor confidence, while 59% of them confirmed they were making contingency plans for a \u0027No Deal\u0027 Brexit. So this was a tough gig. The Prime Minister began by seeking to charm her audience, insisting their creativity and innovation were vital for the nation, as was the wealth created by business.She added: \"A Conservative government will always listen to your voice and back you every step of the way as you grow our economy and create more good jobs.\"Recounting some of the ways in which she believes her government is working with business successfully, for example by financing the biggest investment in the UK\u0027s railways since Victorian times and embarking on the biggest road-building programme seen since the 1970s, Mrs May went on to insist that she was making \"good progress\" in the Brexit negotiations and that the voice of business had helped shape those negotiations.\"If only,\" muttered at least one suited figure.This is the kind of stuff business leaders love to hear: it provides them with reassurance that politicians are thinking about the state of the world and helping future-proof the economy.Unfortunately, it was followed by a light scolding, as the PM reminded her audience that many people do not feel a free market economy is working for them. There were, she said, only two responses: reform the system or resort to \"simple, populist answers that seek to smash that system\".The primary function of the economy, she insisted, was raising people\u0027s living standards.That peroration was followed by a brief interview with Danny Finkelstein, The Times columnist, who is also now a Conservative peer.It was the journalist in Lord Finkelstein that emerged, however, as his first question dealt with the allegation that Mr Johnson had said \"f*** business\". There was a collective intake of breath, followed by nervous laughter, some of it from the First Lord of the Treasury herself. Was this really, she mused, what Times journalism had come to? What the audience wanted to hear was a comprehensive condemnation of Mr Johnson\u0027s comments. What it got was a guarded response in which the PM avoided the question, but at least made clear she disagreed with Messrs Johnson and Hunt, arguing: \"It\u0027s right that we listen to the voice of business. It\u0027s right that business makes its voice heard.\"It was a missed opportunity from the leader of the self-styled party of business to build bridges with a constituency that is feeling increasingly unloved by both the major parties.Before long, Mrs May had moved onto Brexit, shrugging off a question from Lord Finkelstein about whether warnings from business about Brexit were either \"Project Fear or Project Reality\" and insisting she was still focused on obtaining a good deal for the UK on both trade and security.A hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was again ruled out."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/2048x1152/skynews-brandon-lewis-conservative-mp_4200776.jpg?20180108101433 ","title":"muslim council of britain accuses tories of inaction over call for islamophobia inquiry","story":"Mr Khan praised an article that pledged \"zero-tolerance\" and discrimination training written two weeks ago by Mr Lewis, welcoming his \"willingness to talk about Islamophobia rather than resort to shooting the messenger, as was done soon after we raised the matter\".Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Eid message and visit to the Al-Manaar mosque in Kensington, west London, on the anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire were also commended.But Mr Khan warned: \"These are positive steps by yourself and the prime minister, which we welcome, but they do not deal with the issue at hand.\"Our concerns require leadership from the Conservative Party.\"He listed instances of concern, including Tory vice-chair Ben Bradley attempting to \"cover up his dismissal of Islamophobia by a local councillor\" and the first Muslim Cabinet minister Baroness Warsi reportedly being branded a \"p***\" in party meetings.\"It is unclear how these statements and warm words align with the apparent tolerance for Islamophobia detailed here,\" Mr Khan concluded.\"A wide-ranging inquiry into Islamophobia within the party is the absolute minimum - nothing less will do.\" Mr Lewis\u0027 deputy, James Cleverly, has previously denied the Conservatives have a problem with Islamophobia.He told Sky News in April that \"all political parties\" had individuals that \"say and do things that are inappropriate\", adding that the important thing was \"how you deal with that\".Mr Cleverly also challenged Baroness Warsi, who claimed that \"within my own party, there are almost now weekly occurrences of Islamophobic incidents and rhetoric\"."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-royal-queen-harry-meghan_4346643.jpg?20180627001222 ","title":"queen joins harry and meghan to honour young leaders at star studded bash","story":"\"You are the hope and optimism the world needs and we will all do everything that we can to support you in it,\" he added.He and Meghan met a group from Australia, New Zealand and Tonga at the event ahead of their royal tour to the Pacific countries later this year.It come after Meghan\u0027s father reportedly criticised the Queen for agreeing to meet US President Donald Trump before him.

The new law bans all face-covering garb, including for instance motor helmets and ski-masks, in public buildings, but not on the street.

But did you know that when he’s not helping under-confident guys sort out their lives - or at least their shampoo -, he’s super interested in British politics? And we’re not just talking a passing interest. He genuinely seems to understand the technicalities of Brexit more than most people who, I dunno, had a vote in the Referendum. You see, Jonathan has a podcast called Getting Curious . In said podcast, he comes up with a subject he’s curious about, and gets an expert to help explain it for half an hour. And the reason it\u0027s so delightful is that he asks really good questions, and unlike many media personalities, he isn\u0027t proud of his own ignorance.

National Cyber Security Centre chief executive Ciaran Martin said targets for disruption by Kremlin have spread beyond the UK’s “hard infrastructure” such as energy networks to include democratic institutions and the media, he told peers and MPs. Mr Martin told the parliamentary Joint Committee on National Security Strategy: “In the last two years, we have seen a consistent rise in the appetite for attack from Russia on critical sectors, as well as diversification to other sectors they may attack. “In addition to the more traditional targeting of hard infrastructure, like energy infrastructure, we have seen against the West as a whole the targeting of softer power - democratic institutions, media institutions and things relating to freedom of speech.”  He added: “We have seen a diversification by North Korea away from what might be called political retaliation attacks into, frankly, the theft of money, which is what we believe was behind the WannaCry attack.” Mr Martin highlighted the threat from bugs in systems waiting to be activated. “Are we concerned about lurking hostile presences on networks? Yes,” he said. “Does that mean they can be automatically and immediately turned hostile? I think it’s a bit more complicated.” He warned of a “sustained Russian presence in the UK and US internet infrastructure” as a part of a “campaign”. “It’s a foothold, it’s an intrusion that you can use for ongoing espionage purposes or you can use to develop it as the potential for a hostile and disruptive and destructive act in the future,” he added.

The Treasury chief secretary launched a string of thinly veiled attacks on senior Cabinet colleagues in a speech, and declared herself the “disruptor in chief”. And an earlier version of the speech, mistakenly published on a government\u0027s website, would have seen Ms Truss lash out at plans announced by Gove with the backing of the Prime Minister to ban plastic drinking straws. She said it was hard to shake the feeling that rules get in the way of consumers\u0027 choices and lifestyles. A passage in the text of the speech but not in the delivered version highlighted messages about healthy living and not drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws.  Mr Gove and the Prime Minister have made tackling plastic waste a key plank of the Tory strategy to help clean up the environment. Ms Truss joked about the Environment Secretary\u0027s plans, including measures to tackle air pollution, in a speech at the London School of Economics. Many of the rules that we have in place are important in guaranteeing public safety, she said. But it\u0027s hard to shake the feeling that sometimes they just get in the way of consumers\u0027 choices and lifestyles. And Government\u0027s role should not be to tell us what our tastes should be. Too often we\u0027re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straw, or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves... I mean stoves. I can see their point: there\u0027s enough hot air and smoke at the Environment Department already.  She added: Unnecessary red tape restricts business and consumer freedom, so I believe we should cut it wherever we can. Ms Truss, who said she saw her role as disruptor in chief, also called for more action to build homes, claiming restrictions on building are holding cities up. She said urban development rules in Japan were relaxed in the early 2000s giving people the freedom to change their property as they see fit and commercial developers are free to do as they please in designated zones. As a result property prices in Tokyo have been much flatter than in London, she said. It\u0027s restrictions that are causing problems, so we need to liberate, she said. We should densify our built environment and look at making it easier for local neighbourhoods to raise the height of their houses.

AccuWeather’s Jim Andrews said: The UK is looking at a range of five to eight more spells which we would call heatwaves this summer. It would certainly be reasonable to expect 93.2F (34C) highs.”  “It would certainly be reasonable to expect 34C highs this summer, most likely in late July and early August.      “Heat will build in the UK this summer due to high pressure, the sun heating the land, and heat arriving from as far away as Spain.”  The Met Office issued a Level 2 warning as temperatures are set to soar to almost 33C during this week\u0027s heatwave, urging people to take precautions to prevent sun or heat-related injury.  The alert means social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave. Dr Thomas Waite of Public Health England urged people to keep in mind those who may be vulnerable, including the elderly, young children and those with underlying health conditions for whom he said the summer heat can bring real health risks.  The heatwave claimed its first victims as water safety groups and police warned of dangerous situations in the hottest weather of the year so far.

A study of more than 9,000 consumers revealed spenders can be split into eight ‘attitudinal segments’, with each group possessing unique attitudes and characteristics which inform how they manage their money. ‘Trend Spenders’ emerged as the most prominent – those who are ruled by their heart when it comes to money and don’t feel worried about loosening the purse strings as long as they can maintain their lifestyle. More people found themselves in this category than in ‘Sensible Sage’ or ‘Skilled Savers’, which describe those who are more prudent when it comes to their spending. Becky Moffat, Head of Personal Banking and Advance at HSBC UK, which carried out the research, said: “Brits are notoriously reluctant to talk about money and this can impact our financial behaviour.  “Forty-five per cent only check their main bank account once a week or less and one in 10 only check it once a month. “We want to encourage Great Britain to start thinking about how their financial personality could affect how they manage their money, which is why we’ve released the Bank-Life Balance test.” The research also found London is home to a higher number of ‘Driven Achievers’ than the national average. These are people who spend time doing their research, allowing them to make savvy decisions, and are comfortable pushing their financial boundaries if they think there’s going to be a pay-off. Meanwhile, millennials are most likely to be ‘Sensible Sages’ – people who are very considered and see no point in getting into debt unless they can pay it off in full every month.

It\u0027s believed she walked on what had been the site of a barbecue or fire and was left with blisters and burns on her feet.  Emily\u0027s mum Jill Shaw, 31, told of how her daughter was left screaming after the heat of the sand scorched her feet, reports the Daily Record .  The toddler\u0027s feet were left seriously blistered after stepping in burning sand at Granton beach, Edinburgh at the weekend. The incident has left little Emily unable to walk with her feet swathed in bandages.  Jill, from Edinburgh, has now issued a heartfelt appeal to anyone enjoying a barbecue or fire on the beach to make sure they left the place safe when they went home. She said: When we went to the beach in Granton, we were actually going to have a barbecue ourselves. As we approached the beach she took her shoes off just like any other kid would at a beach and I was taking the bags off the buggy. My friend had come with their dog. We saw a log so I said we would go and sit there. Emily ran over to it, but the next thing I knew she was screaming and saying her feet were hot and burning.  I think she had walked on to a bit of sand where someone had had a barbecue or a fire. I\u0027m wondering if the log had been alight overnight and that\u0027s what made the sand so hot. Quick thinking Jill quickly rushed Emily down to the water to cool her feet. The mum-of-four said: She was screaming they were burning. I\u0027ve never seen her in so much pain. We filled up her bucket with water and we had a bag of ice so I was using all that to try to cool them down until my partner arrived to take her to hospital.  Jill and her partner, John Russell, 35, drove Emily to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, and were given immediate attention. Jill said: They took her very quickly. Her feet were all blistered and her toes. The doctors used sterilised water and cotton. We had to pin her down because she was so distressed. The hospital burst the blisters and removed the burnt skin. She was in shock when it happened. I think she gets so frustrated by it all because she\u0027s a lively girl.

The Duke and Duchess joined the Queen at Buckingham Palace to meet young people who have made changes to their communities, including mental health advocates and those tackling domestic violence. The courageous 61 finalists also got the chance to meet a host of celebrities, including David Beckham, presenter Ore Oduba, Olympic boxer Nicola Adams and comedian Lenny Henry, after being presented with their awards. The Duchess of Sussex looked pretty in a blushy pink dress from Prada as she beamed with pride at husband Harry as he opened tonight\u0027s event.  Former prime minister Sir John Major introduced Harry onto the stage, saying he was delighted to see the royal with his new wife at the event just hours after he returned from Lesotho in South Africa. Harry told the crowd it was honour to be there, and confirmed it was the last year of the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards. He assured that the legacy of the programme will no doubt carry on for generations to come as he praised the work of the final group of exciting young change makers from across the 38 commonwealth countries.  He said: The issues you have chosen to take on are at the very core of some of the world\u0027s biggest challenges - from tackling stigma around mental health and promoting gender equality to changing mindsets and habits in order preserve our natural world. Harry also touched on his April appointment to Commonwealth Youth Ambassador during the speech - a new the role which will see him support the work and aspirations of young people across the 53 member states. He said: I\u0027m committed to supporting the legacy of th Queen\u0027s Young Leaders and the 1.4billion commonwealth youths.

He continued: I together with my wife Meghan look forward to meeting people from around the commonwealth to hear your ideas. We look forward to meeting you all this evening but also meting you in you in action in your home countries some day too.

Beckham, who has been working with the group for three years, said he is honoured to work with the programme. He said: To help so many young people globally is such a special initiative. I was very honoured and felt so special to be involved in it. He spent the evening chatting with the young leaders and posing for selfies with them.

The Duchess of Sussex accompanied her new hubby Harry to the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards, which honours youngsters from across the Commonwealth.  The event was streamed on the Royal Family\u0027s Facebook page, meaning people could watch it live from around the world.  But one royal fan was shocked by something she spotted - the way Meghan was sitting.   In the lead up to her wedding and at events since, we\u0027ve seen Meghan adopt the ever-so-ladylike Duchess Slant while sitting at formal events.  It\u0027s a firm favourite of Kate Middleton and Princess Diana also sat in the same way all the time. But shockingly Meghan, who was wearing a pink Prada dress for the occasion, decided to sit a different way at the event - the horror. Instead of clasping her knees and ankles together and slanting her legs to one side, she simply crossed them. Naturally, somebody on social media pointed this out within a matter of seconds.  She wrote: Duchess of Sussex has her legs crossed wrong. What a disrespect to the queen. All royal ladies cross at the ankles or put both legs off to the side. And she wasn\u0027t the only one, as another fan added: Meghan don\u0027t cross your legs Queen doesn\u0027t like that. However other royal fans were outraged that people were giving her such a hard time and rushed to Meghan\u0027s defence. One commented: Let\u0027s focus on the wonderful honourees and NOT legs , dresses or etiquette - these young people deserve more focus.  Another added: Pretty sure the Queen is more concerned with Meghan\u0027s passion and commitment to the Commonwealth than how she crosses her legs. Someone wrote: Omg. She is still in the learning process. Go away judgmental woman. While one supporter pointed out: Actually she would be taught how to cross her legs which Kate often does too - she has been in the public eye for years - she knows what she is doing....give her a break. Another said: Give Megan a break 36 years of crossing your legs is a hard habit to break. The Duchess Slant was named after Kate Middleton, even though it\u0027s been used by royal women for years.  But it\u0027s not just a weird official rule, there\u0027s actually an important reason behind it. Etiquette expert Myka Meier, from Beaumont Etiquette, explains: It is the perfect pose for when a camera is shooting directly in front of you because by slightly slanting the knees to create a zig-zag effect when wearing a dress or skirt, your legs are angled so that the camera only shoots the sides of your legs and protects your modesty. Prince Harry had the important job of opening this year\u0027s awards.

The advert, uploaded by a husband and wife, describes how they want to raise their seven-year-old son using a Victorian style of parenting. In their explanation of their beliefs, they claim their specific parenting approach will help create well-rounded, respectable and polite young people. After revealing their previous nanny was removed from her position, the parents went on to explain the specific way they wish any future child-carer to look after their son. Their super strict rules include no use of any technology, including games consoles and computers, with the only toys on offer being board games, books and traditional wooden toys.  They said: Our reason for restricting him from these kinds of technology is that we\u0027d like him to spend his time becoming the best version of himself and growing into a respectable young man. He doesn\u0027t need a gaming addiction, like other children his age, seem to have, to distract him from that. The parents, who are from Ascot in Berkshire, also explained how the boy\u0027s future nanny must show him minimal affection in order not to spoil him. The unusual advert, placed on childcare, went on to read: We want the nanny to refrain from any contact other than shaking hands and a kiss on the head before bed if necessary. We are firm believers that children should be seen and not heard and believe this will help his development. The parents indicated that failure to follow this rule led to the dismissal of the family’s last nanny. And while most parents will be used to their children\u0027s clothes getting grubby throughout the day, the traditional parents state they want their son to remain in his best clothing throughout the whole day.  They also expect their son to speak formally at all times in the Queen\u0027s English and must always conduct himself properly apart from his one hour of play. Other day-to-day roles the nanny would undertake include getting their son out of bed, dressing him, bathing him and helping with his schooling. The parents are offering \u0026pound55,000 a year, with annual leave and statutory sick pay. While some parents will no-doubt be horrified at their choice of parenting style, the parents went on to defend their choices. They said: We know that the way we\u0027re raising our son is not exactly conventional, however we believe in the long run it will turn him into a reputable and virtuous adult that can make a real impact to the world we live in.

Liz Stear was rushed to hospital and little Lucia Jayne Stear was born via caesarean section but tragically passed away a short time later. Her age was recorded as one day, the hearing was told. Ms Stear was 36 weeks pregnant at the time of the accident close to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, an inquest review hearing was told today. The mum was inside the vehicle with her children in the back seat when the accident happened in November 2016, Coroner Andre Rebello said. An ambulance was called and Ms Stear was rushed to the trauma centre at Aintree hospital in Liverpool but sadly her baby could not be saved.   At Liverpool Coroner\u0027s Court, in Kirkdale, legal representatives from Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital, Wirral council, Liverpool Echo reports .  North West Ambulance Service, Merseyside Police, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and solicitors Broudie Jackson Canter, acting for the Stear family, all attended the proceedings. A baby is considered to be full term if he or she is born anytime from 37 weeks to 42 weeks, meaning Ms Stear\u0027s pregnancy was just before that stage. There may still be criminal charges filed and offences including involuntary or corporate manslaughter have been considered, the hearing was told.

The big blazing orb in a cloudless sky has us all walking round with big grins as Britain catches Summer Fever. It has led to an unusually optimistic sense that three months of sunshine and fun are here. A heatwave, a winning footie team and a host of other events have combined to lift spirits. Many of us wonder if Summer 2018 could turn out to be Britain’s brightest ever. Here are quite a few reasons why... England at World Cup  They said they’d win it and now we’re daring to believe. England’s stonking 6-1 defeat of Panama has convinced us that Harry Kane and the lads really could be World Cup champions again and bring home the 18-carat gold prize. Its predecessor in 1966, the Jules Rimet Trophy, was stolen only to be found by a dog called Pickles. And Pickles happens to be what Jordan Pickford’s mum calls him. See – it’s fate.  You love it or you love to hate it, but Love Island is THE summer TV hit. And this year we, like, get an extra, like, week of being pied, getting muggy and having The Ick. Like. Music festivals  There’s no Glastonbury this year as the Somerset farm needs a break but festival season is well under way. And fans flocking to Reading, Bestival, Latitude or Leeds may actually avoid the traditional mudbaths and waterlogged tents. In other huge music news, pop princess Britney Spears is doing three nights in Scarborough. And she will no doubt be delighting locals with her greatest hit, “Gi’ us another clout, flower.” Chance to show Trump how we feel about him  President Donald Trump will be full of his own importance on a three-day visit here next month. But some of the 53,000 protesters taking to the streets to protest will prick his pomposity. They have crowdfunded a giant Trump Baby balloon to fly above London as Britain says “Up Yours.” Markle Sparkle and the Fab Four  Meghan and Harry’s wedding kicked off our red-hot summer but the Markle sparkle continues at a string of engagements for the new Duke and Duchess.

Ain Sakhri Lovers is thought to be 11,000 years old and features two figures, both of ambiguous gender, making love, face-to-face in a sitting position. Discovered in a cave near Bethlehem, the figurine has an overall phallic shape and may have been used by the Natufians for rituals associated with fertility. The object will tour the country for the first time in the Desire, Love Identity: Exploring LGBTQ Histories exhibition tour, travelling to Oxford, Nottingham, Bolton and Norwich.  The museum also announced on-site tours, at its famous London venue, of LGBTQ objects. Highlights of the tours, to take place next year, could include a 4,000-year-old Babylonian deity, the Queen Of The Night. She is thought to be a manifestation of the fierce goddess Ishtar, who was credited with gender bending powers, and has been known to sometimes sport a beard. During public ceremonies performed by followers of the cult of Ishtar, temple guards would walk through the streets dressed as men on half of their bodies and as women on the other half. And a surviving poem describes how Ishtar could turn men into women, women into men. Other objects could include The Warren Cup, from the 1st Century, depicting men having sex while being watched by a servant. The cup was impounded by US customs as pornography in 1953.  The British Museum turned down an offer to purchase the object in the 1950s but bought it in 1999 for a then record \u0026pound1.8 million. Highlights could also feature hot chocolate cups once belonging to an 18th Century aristocratic female couple, who shared the same bed and were known as the two most celebrated virgins in Europe. Other objects could include a marble bust of Antinous, whose love affair with Roman emperor Hadrian is one of the most famous in antiquity. According to documents from the time, Hadrian wept like a woman at his lover\u0027s death. British Museum director Hartwig Fischer said the museum wanted volunteers to lead the tours and decide on their content and how they are delivered. The British Museum has always been open to everyone, presenting all cultures to visitors from around the world, he said.  It is hugely important that institutions like ours meaningfully present LGBTQ art and history, so I am delighted that we are offering these new tours that explore the LGBTQ experiences found throughout our collection, both ancient and modern. Before the opening of the physical tour, the museum will launch an audio tour, available on streaming services and to download, narrated by actors Fiona Shaw and Simon Russell Beale. Beale said: People might be surprised how many objects in the British Museum have LGBTQ connections. Many might even have seen some of them on display without knowing how they relate to queer history.

The \u002737\u0027 in the price tag is reference the total number of knockouts Ali amassed in his career - and inside there is no shortage of boxing memorabilia and apparatus. The sprawling estate comes with two houses, 81 acres, as well as a steam room, massage room and a basketball court. Ali both lived and boxed in the home, which is family reportedly bought in 1975, 10 years before The Greatest was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s disease.  He died on June 3, 2016 aged 74 from septic shock. The listing agency, Cressy and Everett Real Estate, says it has received interest from people in Chicago, New York, and even the UK.  Once known as the Louisville Lip for his brashness, Ali used the home in his later years to have some serenity from the intensity of fame, as well as the perfect spot to recover. The estate, built in 1990, comes with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, as well as security. There is also a man-made pool, as well as a river, pond and vegetable garden. According to listing agent Tim Mitchell, the estate was previous owned by one of Al Capone\u0027s lieutenant bodyguards, Louis Campagna, and Capone himself lived down the river.

More than one hundred people entered the competition via the social media platform. Ultimately Coventry City Council have opted to name the lorries after young children to avoid disappointment. They said: Thank you to all who entered the competition!  There have been so many great entries that it\u0027s too hard to judge.

Police, soldiers and Black Hawk military helicopters took part in the huge drill, which enacted the arrival of hundreds of migrants on the country\u0027s border with Slovenia. Overseen by the far-right interior minister, the exercise enacted the arrival of hundreds of migrants on the country\u0027s border with Slovenia. The drill dovetailed with the right-wing government\u0027s efforts to discourage migrants from setting off to find a home in central Europe. Austria took in more than 1% of its population in asylum seekers during the 2015-2016 migration crisis, and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u0027s conservatives won last year\u0027s election pledging to prevent a repeat of that influx. They govern in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party.  Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the Freedom Party told reporters A state that in the worst case cannot protect its borders loses its credibility. I am determined that events like those of 2015 must not occur again. And that is exactly the message we want to send from here. Neighbouring Slovenia however said the drill exaggerated the risk of another influx. The exercise is not needed. I see it even as a little provocative, Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar was quoted as saying by national news agency STA. The exercise was carried out at Spielfeld, a crossing where Austria set up a large crowd-management system in early 2016 designed to handle up to 11,000 people a day, only for the number of arrivals to collapse soon afterwards. In contrast to a smaller exercise held under the previous government, Tuesday\u0027s drill did not involve migrants being violent or any arrests. But five military helicopters, including two Black Hawks, hovered overhead.  Two hundred trainee police officers acted the part of migrants seeking entry. The peaceful crowds were hemmed in by security forces and fed through a system of fences and other barriers. Migration has returned to the top of the political agenda in Europe after the Bavarian sister party to German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s Christian Democrats last week gave her an ultimatum to broker a European immigration deal. The issue threatens to wreck her coalition government.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/Gjen_Kingsway_Traffic3.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"busy stretch of dundees kingsway to close as pedestrian crossings installed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the busiest stretches of road in Dundee is set to close twice in the next two weeks so new pedestrian crossings can be installed.The A90 Kingsway will close eastbound between the Old Glamis Road roundabout and the Forfar Road junction from 7.30pm on Friday until 6.30am next Monday.The dual carriageway will then close in the opposite direction, westbound from Forfar Road to Old Glamis Road, from 7.30pm on Friday July 6 until 6.30am on Monday July 9.During each closure, vehicles will likely be diverted via either Claverhouse Road or Clepington Road.The closures are being instigated by Dundee City Council in order to install new sets of pedestrian crossings that will make getting to and from Caird Park safer for walkers and cyclists.Workers will install Toucan-style crossings, which have wider crossing paths than Pelican or Puffin crossings, along the Kingsway.Council chiefs do not expect the crossings to cause traffic build-ups, as they will only activate when required by crossing pedestrians or cyclists.As revealed by the Tele last year, the council drew up plans to install the crossings at the Kingsway’s junctions with Graham Street and Mains Loan.The plans were made possible by a Scottish Government grant to encourage people to walk and cycle.Severe disruption is expected as a result of each closure, as the road is the main link between the central belt and Aberdeenshire.Analysis from traffic counters operated by the Department for Transport shows that, on average, more than 38,000 vehicles travel eastbound on the road every day.These include more than 28,000 cars, 135 buses, 6,900 light goods vehicles and 2,800 heavy goods vehicles such as articulated lorries.A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “These closures are to facilitate the installation of new dual Toucan crossings linked to Caird Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b30b38a540e6-e1529933778347.jpg ","title":"dalmation ludo jets out of dundee by plane after family

arrived in Dundee a fortnight ago to be adopted by a local family.But his stay was short-lived, after it emerged a young family member was allergic to dogs.Ludo had been placed with the family by the Dalmatian Adoption Society, based in Gloucester.Sue Bell, of the society, said Ludo arrived in Dundee via a series of car journeys driven by volunteers.But he left in style – after an amateur pilot offered to fly him back to England.Sue said: “Very sadly after Ludo went to live with his new family in Dundee they discovered their little boy was allergic to him and ended up having to use an inhaler.“The family were heartbroken but had no choice other than to put Ludo back up for adoption.“We were delighted when a family in South Wales agreed to adopt Ludo and we again put out an appeal for volunteers to transport Ludo back down south.“That is when our airborne knights in shining armour came to our rescue.”Nick Baker and William Simmonds contacted Sue to offer to fly Ludo back to Gloucester for onward movement to his new home.Amateur pilot and plane owner William said: “I happened to see an old friend, Nick Baker, had posted on the Dalmatian Adoption Society’s Facebook page, in response to an appeal for help.“I had recently seen a post from another pilot who had flown a puppy for re-homing – which triggered the idea that perhaps I could do a similar thing.“After looking into the routes and journey times, I got in touch with Nick and suggested I might be able to do the flying were he to sit in the back and look after Ludo.“He got in touch with Sue and the rest is history.“I am looking to increase my flying experience and intend to complete my commercial pilot licence. These are hours I’d have to fly anyway, so having the ability to help such a worthy cause as part of my hour building is extremely gratifying.”Nick said: “I have a love for dalmatians and DAS do a great job saving dogs and managing to get them re-homed.“I always do my best to help out in any way I can. When I saw a dog needed transport from Scotland to South Wales I offered my help.“Will messaged me regarding the option of flying to reduce the travel time for Ludo.“He has a share in a plane and a love of flying so was willing to do the journey for free.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/TRAVEL-Beaches-070558.jpg.jpg ","title":"dont post on facebook that you are on holiday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTayside Police is urging folk not to post on Facebook that they are on holiday.The force has issued a statement with security advice during the summer.It said: \u0026#8220Consider the information that you post on social media, if you advertise that your home is unoccupied, if you are going on holiday for example, it can be an open invitation for opportunistic thieves.\u0026#8221Residents should also be particularly careful during spells of warm weather, the statement said.It added: \u0026#8220With the temptation to open windows during the summer months or with doors left unlocked whilst you enjoy the garden, thieves may take these opportunities to commit theft.\u0026#8220Electrical items such as televisions, games consoles, tablet computers and mobile telephones are particularly attractive to criminals.\u0026#8220Please make sure that, where possible, you do not leave these items on show for opportunist thieves, who may be window shopping.\u0026#8220If you are going out and you have a house alarm remember to set it and lock doors and windows when you leave.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united boss ray mckinnon moves to put medical record claim straight","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee United boss Ray

responded by issuing a statement.“In light of reports in the press this week regarding the signing of players at Dundee United during my period as manager, I feel I have no option other than to clarify the following point,” it read.“I deal in facts only and the fact is that in my time as manager every single player signed was put through a medical by the medical staff at Dundee United.“I am disappointed that I have had to make this statement because although things did not work out the way I would have wished, I left the club on good terms.“I have moved on and my focus is on an exciting new challenge at Morton.”He would make no further comment and it’s understood he now considers the matter closed.United, meanwhile, were back at work on Thursday as pre-season training kicked

says ex dundee star konrad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Thomas Konrad urged new Dundee United signing Benjamin Siegrist to make the switch to the City of Discovery – even if it meant joining the wrong club.The German central defender spent two enjoyable years with the Dark Blues from 2014 to 2016 and has just left Swiss second-tier side Vaduz.He spent his two seasons with the Liechtenstein-based club with new Tannadice signing Siegrist and says the Tangerines have got themselves a keeper – though he’d have preferred him to have signed for the Dark Blues instead.Konrad said: “He asked me a lot about my time in Dundee and said United had called him. I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this

providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

buildings","story":"\u0026nbspURGENT action is needed to prevent people from being injured or killed by debris falling from crumbling Inverness buildings, according to a former city provost.Councillor Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be downloaded at https://academystreet.org/Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 5:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116299.jpg","title":"Woman identified as man to get into hostel dorm","story":"\u0026nbspA WOMEN\u0026rsquoS rights group has expressed concerns for the safety of guests staying at a Highland hostel after one of its bloggers was able to book herself into a male-only dormitory.Inverness Youth Hostel in Victoria Drive allowed Trina Budge to stay in a men\u0027 room after she told a receptionist she self-identified as a man.She went on to write a blog post about her stay and said she is concerned women could be at risk as a result of people taking advantage of the self-determination policy.She said: \"There are huge concerns over safety.

men.Children would be taken away from their communities by elders, and trained in practical, religious and spiritual practices for between three and six months in a process called Mukanda.Sisters Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton, from Kent, made a two-year trip to Angola and Namibia, recovering 3,000 pieces, 130 of which were donated to the university.After more than 70 years in storage, the suit and a number of other artefacts will now be on display as part of an exhibition on growing up around the world.Rachel Rydquist, a museum studies student at the university, said: “By the time the sisters came back, it was the middle of the Second World War, and they were drafted in to be nurses in London.“So there’s a bit of a lack of information about it, because they were tied up with the war.“I don’t believe that it’s been put on display.“There’s so much stuff in the university collection, and it might just not have been a fit for any of the exhibits that were being done.”She added: “It’s also really difficult to put something out when there’s not a lot of information on it.”Rachel had taken the lead on researching the suit before it was put on display in the exhibition.The new project, which opened earlier this month in the King’s Museum, is to commemorate the Scottish Government’s Year of Young People.The exhibit, called Growing up: Different Journeys, is split into four sections – rites of passage, which the net suit is a part of, education, disruption and stories.According to Rachel, the exhibit aims to explore not only how different cultures experience growing up, but also the universal nature of becoming an adult.She said: “We thought it would be fitting in the Year of Young People, and to have artefacts that show the process across the world.”The exhibit will be open in the King’s Museum until November 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/rabbitnew-857x564.jpg ","title":"north east mechanic finds live

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-common-riding-2018-when-faced-with-adversity-peters-your-man","story":"WHEN faced with adversity, there\u0027s only one man to call - Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep-calm-its-only-the-common-riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does.

Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son.

Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7067548.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"asbo-bans-musselburgh-man-from-shouting-and-swearing-at-neighbours","story":"              AN ORDER banning a Musselburgh man from shouting and swearing at neighbours has been granted by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The quality indicators for the school were listed \u0027good\u0027, with one, for ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion, rated \u0027very good\u0027.  Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.

The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is.

The inaugural event on December 9, 2017 saw 8,000 people sleep under the stars on the coldest night of the year on the capital\u0026rsquos West Princes Street Gardens.  The night became the world\u0026rsquos largest ever event of its kind.  Building on the momentum of that event, Sleep in the Park 2018 will hit Glasgow with the venue expected to be the Kelvingrove Bandstand.  Participants will be joined by an impressive lineup of artists before bedding down for a cold night in each city.  Returning for the second year, Amy MacDonald will be joined on the bill by fellow Scot KT Tunstall, and each will be performing in all four cities on the night.  An aircraft has been donated by prominent Glasgow-based businessman Andrew Devlin to provide the flight for the artists to use.

The Nuclear Education Trust, a think-tank and charity, says their conclusion is drawn from evidence from defence diversification projects around the world.  The report recommends that workers and communities must take the lead in making decisions for moving away from Trident \"but a broad partnership involving all stakeholders is necessary for success\".    Funding must be available not just for putting a plan into action but for organising, analysis of the situation, planning and then implementation, the charity said.  Peter Burt, Nuclear Education Trust Board trustee said: \u0026ldquoOur independent analysis of international experience of defence diversification tells us that a government needs to be proactive in getting the conditions right for a successful transition from skilled defence jobs to those in the equally skilled, civil sector. Those conditions include complete stakeholder participation including workers and communities, and national, regional and local political support. Proactive planning and comprehensive funding, with continued learning for effective implementation are essential for success.  \"Many defence industry jobs are at risk from automation, global supply chains, changes in strategic thinking as well as the sheer cost of the work in today\u0027s austere financial climate. The Nuclear Education Trust calls on the current and future governments to make use of the findings of this research and integrate them into an effective defence diversification policy, part of a comprehensive industrial strategy.\"  Fabian Hamilton, MP, shadow minister for peace and disarmament said: \"While it is not yet Labour Party policy to scrap Trident, I am committed, not only to transitioning away from nuclear weapons, but to protecting jobs at the same time.  \"High-skilled jobs are good for our economy and, if we decide to transition away from Trident, defence diversification is the only way to ensure that the vital skills used in the development of Britain\u0027s nuclear weapons are not lost.  TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"The UK\u0027s defence capability will always need to change over time to safeguard against new threats in a changing world. When decisions are made, it\u0027s important to protect and prioritise good quality UK jobs and the communities linked to the defence industry. Unions and the workforce should have a say in creating new opportunities for highly skilled workers in defence and other advanced manufacturing and engineering industries.\"  The report is launched in Parliament at 4pm on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-yes-immigration-is-a-good-thing","story":"              I SOMETIMES wonder why we call them \u0026ldquoleaders, when the evidence suggests that most politicians are remarkably slow to catch up with popular opinion. Take, for example, the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoemergency summit on migration, which has been convened just as immigration from illegal crossings of the Mediterranean and asylum claims have reached their lowest level for years.  The impetus for these talks is not the genuine refugee crisis that faced European countries several years ago, when Angela Merkel blithely introduced an open-door policy that has seen about 1.4 million migrants arrive in Germany since 2015. That, incidentally, created a huge upsurge in human trafficking, deaths at sea and an enormous headache for the southern European countries, especially Italy, to which many migrants headed. While that was at its peak, Mrs Merkel carried on as if there were no problem.  Now that she is dependent on her coalition partners, the anti-immigration Christian Social Union, it\u0026rsquos her political prospects that are in danger rather than piffling matters such as the lives of refugees or the cultural stability of Europe. The issue has naturally become much more pressing. It\u0026rsquos par for the course, I suppose, that the political priorities of the leader of a comfortable Western country should trump (I use the word advisedly) the desperation of those who come from places torn apart by war, governed by oppressive regimes, or devoid of opportunities to make a decent living. Yet migration has become a uniquely divisive issue, for reasons which often seem thoroughly irrational.  The EU summit has already been boycotted by four EU countries \u0026ndash the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia \u0026ndash where immigration is a significant populist issue, while Italy has produced proposals which aim to end the link between a migrant\u0026rsquos point of arrival and the responsibility for dealing with his or her asylum claim.  Given that Italy has had to deal with the results of Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos implied \u0026ldquocome one, come all rhetoric, that\u0026rsquos understandable but it will horrify other EU leaders, many of whom face growing electoral discontent over immigration. It could also create further problems for freedom of movement within the EU \u0026ndash one of the \u0026ldquofour fundamental freedoms.  In fact, despite Schengen\u0026rsquos supposed guarantee of free movement, the migrant crisis has already led to internal restrictions despite the EU\u0026rsquos objections border controls were instituted between Denmark and Sweden for several years.  Yet the EU\u0026rsquos talk of freedom of movement, rather like its talk of its single market, disguises the underlying problem, which is that neither its movements nor its markets are in any sense genuinely free. On the contrary they are protectionist measures which create barriers to those outside (which means, of course, most of the rest of the world, and the developing world in particular).  Before the First World War, in a world of many more borders and nation states, there were few obstacles to travel and resettlement, passports and border controls were a rarity and naturalisation for longstanding residents was a mere formality. The United States, where Donald Trump is disgustingly and dishonestly weaponising debate on the subject, owes its existence and success entirely to immigration.  Part of the reason this approach is working with so many Trump voters, and is also gaining support for similarly unsavoury populists such as Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary, is, it must be said, the reluctance of Western political elites to countenance discussion of the issue, and their implication that anyone who raises concerns about immigration is a racist. It\u0026rsquos only eight years, remember, since Gordon Brown airily dismissed Gillian Brown, one of his own supporters, as a \u0026ldquobigoted woman for raising the matter.  The reason this attitude was so dangerous was that it concealed the facts about immigration and conflated the issue with a quite separate one, which is to do with multi-culturalism and globalisation. Racism in Britain, though it certainly exists, is fortunately confined to a (dwindling) minority.  Immigration, despite the noise about it, is also a minority concern, even among Leave voters not a single poll found it cited as the major factor in the Brexit referendum.  But it is a very bad thing that it has not been properly discussed, because the evidence in favour of immigration is overwhelmingly positive, while the objections to it are largely about issues such as integration, welfare, schools and the provision of social housing.  Immigrants contribute considerably more to the economy than they cost (one report found European Economic Area migrants put in 34 per cent more in tax than they claimed in welfare payments). One obvious example of their contribution is the NHS, where more than one quarter of the doctors employed are from overseas. One consequence of Theresa May\u0026rsquos misinterpretation of Brexit (which she opposed) as being primarily about immigration (which most Leave voters did not list as a priority) is to endanger not only healthcare but also all manner of other areas of our economy.  Agriculture, education, and the technology sector, for example, are all highly dependent on migrant workers or overseas students. And the decline in the birthrate in Western countries, and their ageing populations, ought to make importing people to contribute to pensions a priority.  What\u0026rsquos more, a welcoming approach towards immigration ought to be the natural position for a party which claims to support economic growth, a free society and open markets. From a truly liberal perspective, immigration policy shouldn\u0026rsquot even be a matter for the Government but for the market. After all, if people choose to come to the UK, it is because they see it as an opportunity for themselves and their families and, if they choose to stay, they become British anyway.  Businesses and immigrants themselves are best placed to determine whether migration is in their mutual interest, which is why the idea of having some number plucked from the air, with no reference to need or desirability, fixed as a cap is absurd. The Home Secretary\u0026rsquos announcement that the default position of the UK would be to grant settled status to EU nationals living here was welcome, if belated, but did not go far enough.  Politicians should be making the case that immigration is not a problem but a boon, while populist rhetoric about crime or welfare should be rebutted vigorously. If the EU leaders have not wanted to discuss the issue until now, the least they can do is point out that the facts disprove the claims of those opposed to immigration."},{"url":null,"title":"economy-secretary-out-in-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon has\u0026nbspstarted reshuffling\u0026nbspher cabinet, with Economy Secretary Keith Brown leaving to focus on campaigning for independence.

We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.  \"Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0027t be helping. If things don\u0027t alter this week, we\u0027re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.\"  Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a \"potentially huge effect\" on British food production.  The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.  Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \"worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades\".  The UK has been hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent have been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.  The British Soft Drinks Association said the shortage was continuing to affect a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector."},{"url":null,"title":"ofcom-give-green-light-to-new-bbc-scotland-channel","story":"              THE new BBC digital channel for Scotland has been given the final green light by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

Health Secretary Shona Robison, Communities Secretary Angela Constance, and Economy Secretary Keith Brown are all out, the Scottish Government confirmed.  Ms Robison and Ms Constance - who had been tipped for the chop - wrote to Nicola Sturgeon to confirm their resignations.\u0026nbsp  The First Minister paid tribute to their work. She is due to announce her new Cabinet later.  Also sacked are International Development minister Dr Alasdair Allan, Community Safety minister Annabelle Ewing, and mental health minister Maureen Watt.  The end of Ms Robison\u0026rsquos tenure as health secretary had been widely predicted given grim waiting time statistics and scandals at her local health board, NHS Tayside.  Her departure coincided with the BMA in Scotland claiming the NHS was being \u0026ldquopushed to the brink, \u0026nbspthe worst waiting times for cancer treatment in six years, and an investigation confirming a culture of \u0026ldquobullying and harassment at NHS Lothian - a not untypical day.  In her resignation letter to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Robison said her three and a half years in the post had been an immense privilege \u0026ldquoalbeit at times very challenging and all consuming.  She said her last year had been \u0026ldquoparticularly challenging on a personal level, as she had lost both parents, had a health scare of her own, and seen other \u0026ldquobig changes in her life.  \u0026ldquoI thank you for your support during these difficult times, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI feel that I have reached a point in my life just now where I would be best to step down from a role in Government. I have entered a new chapter in my life, including a new relationship, where it would be good to take time to focus on those closest to me, who have too often had to come second place to my job, which has hard for us all.  In reply, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Robison had \u0026ldquoserved with distinction over her 11 years in government, and said her time as health secretary had ended with high levels of patient satisfaction and the lowest A\u0026ampE waiting times in the UK for three years.  She also said the integration of health and social care was to her \u0026ldquoimmense credit.  She wrote: \u0026ldquoI know that recent years have brought a number of personal challenges for you, including the loss of both your parents and health worries of your own, among other issues.  \u0026ldquoDespite this, you continued to serve the people of Scotland with dedication, just as you did your loved ones. I am delighted to wish you every happiness in your new relationship.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos correspondence with Ms Constance lacked any such warmth, and Ms Constance offered no reason for leaving, strongly suggesting she was sacked.  The Almond Valley MSP said it had been an honour to serve in government for eight years, and said she had been particularly proud of her work on affordable homes, social security, gender recognition on public boards, gypsy travellers and child poverty.  \u0026ldquoI have been very lucky throughout my political life to have had the support of my family and there is no doubt that without them I couldn\u0026rsquot have undertaken the many roles I have had the privilege of occupying, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to spending more times with them and my growing son.  In rely, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Constance had worked \u0026ldquotirelessly to give a voice at the Cabinet table to those who are not always heard in society.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe fact Scotland has received international recognition for the work we have done to support refugees, on LGBTI+ rights, on women\u0026rsquos right and many other areas is in no small part down to your leadership.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required.

Jim Chapman was just five months into his two-year contract with the Cumbernauld side when he left the club in October last year after a run of poor results.  His departure came just days after heated exchanges between the management team and fans during a home defeat to Elgin City.  Mr Chapman has now launched an employment tribunal against the fan-owned team, which operates as a Community Interest Club.  He is seeking a payout of \u0026pound27,390 for breach of contract, as well as more than \u0026pound800 for unpaid holiday pay.  The tribunal initially awarded in favour of the ex-manager as the club failed to lodge a response on time, but that decision has now been overturned at Clyde\u0026rsquos request and a full hearing is scheduled take place at a later date.

Mr Chapman, who was a forward for Albion Rovers and Dumbarton during his playing career, has also lodged a claim for unlawful deduction of wages.

Health Secretary Shona Robison, Communities Secretary Angela Constance and Economy Secretary Keith Brown are leaving the government, as are three junior ministers.  The cabinet is expanded from 10 to 12 places.  The respected social security minister Jeane Freeman becomes the new health Secretary, transport minister Humza Yousaf becomes justice secretary, universities minister Shirley Anne-Somerville is social security secretary, public health minister Aileen Campbell becomes communities secretary, and Brexit minister Michael Russell is elevated to cabinet rank as secretary for government business and constitutional relations.

More ministers are expected to be named tomorrow.  The new line up is likely to stay in place until the 2021 Holyrood election.

A gaggle of journalists and photographers spent the afternoon huddled around the railings of the Georgian townhouse, glued to their phones for the latest updates.  Every time a swanky car drove past, notepads would rustle and microphones hastily assemble. There were a number of false alarms.  But as a string of SNP figures were dropped off and quickly let inside, a picture emerged of dramatic change within the corridors of Bute House.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon \u0026ndash widely known as a cautious politician \u0026ndash was presiding over one of the biggest reshuffles in the history of devolution.  Standing on the steps of Bute House just after 5.30pm, she spoke of bringing \u0026ldquofresh talent to the table and referenced the looming challenges of Brexit and delivering Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system.  There were casualties, of course. But around her, five new faces beamed.  Former transport minister Humza Yousaf was promoted to Justice Secretary \u0026ndash a position previously held by Michael Matheson, who will become Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.  First given a ministerial role under Alex Salmond, Mr Yousaf is among Holyrood\u0026rsquos most high-profile figures.  As transport minister, he faced down calls to quit over ScotRail\u0026rsquos performance, and survived a blizzard of criticism over winter storms and \u0026ldquosnagging issues with the \u0026pound1.35bn Queensferry Crossing.  Another big name given a boost was former Brexit minister Michael Russell. Previously Education Secretary between 2009 and 2014, Mr Russell has burst back into the political limelight in his role representing Scotland in the Brexit negotiations.  He will become Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations \u0026ndash a newly created role focused on protecting Scotland\u0026rsquos interests as the UK leaves the EU.  Another new position reflecting the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos shifting priorities was given to Shirley-Anne Somerville.  The MSP, who has been minister for further education since May 2016, will become the Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People.  This will give her responsibility for overseeing Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system following the devolution of 11 benefits, worth around \u0026pound3.3bn a year.  Elsewhere, Jeane Freeman will replace embattled Health Secretary Shona Robison.  Elected in 2016, Ms Freeman is a former Labour special adviser who converted to the independence cause and previously co-founded the campaign group Women for Independence.  She is well respected among backbenchers, but came under fire last year over her alleged role in \u0026ldquosmearing a nurse who challenged Ms Sturgeon during a TV debate. False claims the NHS worker was the wife of a Tory councillor were traced back to Ms Freeman and SNP MP Joanna Cherry.  Finally, Aileen Campbell will take on the role of Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, tasked with reforming councils and tackling poverty.  Previously public health minister, Ms Campbell has led calls for the creation of \u0026ldquosafer injection centres, allowing heroin addicts to take the drug in specialist clinics aimed at preventing deaths.  At the end of a tense day, only three positions remained unchanged. Education Secretary John Swinney, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham and Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop will all remain in their current posts.  Meanwhile, on the lower rungs, Joe FitzPatrick was announced as the new public health minister last night, having previously served as business minister.  Jamie Hepburn was given the expanded role of minister for business, fair work and skills, and Paul Wheelhouse will become minister for energy, connectivity and the islands."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7979783.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-scots-advised-to-take-shorter-showers-as-water-supplies-run-low","story":"              THOUSANDS of Scots have been asked to \"use water wisely\" by taking shorter showers among other measuers\u0026nbspfollowing concerns about reservoir and loch\u0026nbsplevels during a dry June.  The Herald has been told that Scottish Water has valid warnings for in and around Stornoway on Lewis and Elgin, Kinloss and Forres in Moray which has been in place for up to nine days - even before the current hot spell.  It emerged as the Met Office issued yellow health warning for heatwave conditions from Tuesday until Thursday evening covering the west and north-east of England.  The warning means there is an 80% chance of temperatures which could be a risk to health, and is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare.  Rail passengers are being warned of lengthy delays as speed restrictions are enforced to prevent tracks from buckling in a heatwave that has sparked wildfires across parts of Britain - and shows no signs of abating.    Network Rail has deployed \u0026ldquoextreme weather action teams in readiness for even warmer conditions following a peak of 30.1C (86.1F) on Monday.  The water company said called on customers to \"use water wisely\u0026nbspas a result of prolonged dry weather in the area\".  It said that dry conditions and increased demand in the area meant that \"efficiency measures\" are being requested of customers served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works, Elgin and the Stornoway Water Treatment Works.  Residents are being advised to turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving, take shorter showers and only boil the kettle with the volume of water needed. They also advise to use a bucket or a watering can for use\u0026nbspto clean cars and in gardens.        Scotland has received a little over half the average rainfall for May this year and the dry spell of weather continues across June.  Stornoway has experienced an unusual spell of 23 consecutive days with no rainfall, with only 31mm of rain falling in Lewis\u0026rsquos capital in one month.  Scottish Water said the dry conditions have caused \"lower than normal water levels\" in Loch Mor an Stairr, which supplies Stornoway Water Treatment Works (WTW).\u0026nbsp  And despite some\u0026nbsprainfall,\u0026nbspincreased demand in the area\u0026nbspled to the utility encouraging customers served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works (WTW) to take simple water efficiency measures.  Peter Farrer, Scottish Water\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoWe are encouraging everyone living and working locally to take simple steps to use water wisely. By doing so, we can significantly reduce water usage which also helps the environment, saves energy and ensures that we continue to provide clear, fresh water to customers in the area.  A Scottish Water spokeswoman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoScottish Water has issued advice to customers to use water wisely in two localised areas, parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  \u0026ldquoThe advice was issued because of prolonged dry weather in these areas, despite some recent rainfall, and (in the case of Moray) increased demand.

Their intervention led Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary, to rebuke them for their \u0026ldquocompletely inappropriate behaviour while his Cabinet colleague Boris Johnson was reported to have said: \u0026ldquoF*** business.  Yesterday in the Commons, the Foreign Secretary, while insisting no one could question the Conservative Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopassionate support for the world of commerce, conspicuously failed to deny the attributed remark, telling MPs: \u0026ldquoIt may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business.  The latest developments came as:  *MPs on the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee today warned that the UK Government\u0026rsquos forecast divorce bill from the EU could be off by more than \u0026pound10 billion, which would make the final settlement as much as \u0026pound50bn  *business and union leaders from the UK and across Europe issued a joint plea ahead of this week\u0026rsquos European Council meeting that Britain and Brussels \u0026ldquoinject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland and  *Josep Borrell, the Spanish Foreign Minister, sought to dispel the notion that the UK could remain in the single market for goods but without freedom of movement, insisting: \u0026ldquoGermany will say no, France will say no, Spain will say no.\"  At its annual conference in London, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders claimed contingency planning, job losses and investment cuts were \"the price we pay for slow decision-making\" by Government.  Mike Hawes, its Chief Executive, noted how in the face of Brexit the \u0026pound347 million of investment earmarked for new models and facilities in the UK in the first half of this year was \u0026ldquoominous as it was well down from the \u0026pound647m for the same period in 2017.  \"We don\u0027t seem to be any closer to the certainty and stability the whole of British industry needs,\" he declared.  At Westminster, the SNP\u0026rsquos Peter Grant asked: \u0026ldquoHow many jobs must be put on the line and how many businesses need to speak out before the Prime Minister and her Brexit Secretary change course before it\u0026rsquos too late?  Meanwhile, official figures showed the UK remained the top destination for inward investment in Europe last year with nearly 76,000 jobs created across the country but the number of jobs safeguarded by inward investment dropped by more than half from 32,672 in 2016/17 to 15,063 last year.  Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, talked up Britain\u0026rsquos current economic position, saying: \"Two years since the EU referendum, the UK has record employment and seen an increase in new jobs as a result of inward investment.  \"We remain the top destination in Europe and third in the world for foreign direct investment, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"ofcom-has-ignored-scottish-newspapers-in-bbc-station-decision-it-is-claimed","story":"              THE \"legitimate concerns\" of Scotland\u0027s newspapers about the new BBC Scotland channel have been ignored by the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, it was declared last night.  John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, spoke out after Ofcom gave their \"very disappointing\" final permission for the BBC to launch its new BBC Scotland service.  The new channel will begin broadcasting on a digital channel in early 2019, and has already begun hiring around 80 staff for the operation.  Newspapers have been concerned the new channel, with expanded digital content, would present increased publicly-funded competition to newspapers and their own news websites.  The BBC also announced it is to set up a new design and engineering hub in Glasgow, investing \u0026pound4m and recruiting an additional 60 people into \"technology and design-led\" roles over the next three years.  In its decision, Ofcom rejects concerns about online competition, and also a concern that newspaper journalists will leave their print employers for the new station.  Mr McLellan said: \"Disappointingly, the ruling is to all intents identical to the indicative decision issued earlier this year.  \"It\u0027s a very disappointing outcome which ignores the legitimate concerns of commercial news providers, and despite months of investigation and consultation amounts to just accepting the BBC\u0027s assurances that its plans do not encroach on private operations.  \"There is not even a commitment to monitor the situation, and surprisingly it seems that Ofcom has even less concern about wider market impact than the old BBC Trust.\"  The Ofcom report says that \"in relation to online news, we found that the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to lead either to a substantial expansion or to a change in the focus of the BBC\u0026rsquos online news offering.  \"We concluded that, in its current form, the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on print and online news provision.\"  It adds that it does not believe that the proposal to create 80 journalism posts, only half of which are news gathering roles, \"poses a significant threat to the ability of Scottish newspapers to attract or retain journalists.\"  The new digital hub will be in Glasgow, and will be similar to existing hubs in London and Salford.  In total it will have more than 100 staff, including existing BBC Design and Engineering staff in Pacific Quay, Glasgow.  The new staff will be working on \"voice platforms\", developing BBC services for Amazon Echo, Google Home and the Apple HomePod.  There will also be jobs in the education wing of the broadcaster, as well as apps, websites and other online material.  Tony Hall, the BBC Director-General said: \"Ofcom giving the green light for the new channel is great news.  \"The new service has huge potential and I\u0026rsquom excited about what it can achieve.\"  Matthew Postgate, the BBC Chief Technology and Product Officer said: \"We know there is a huge amount of technological and creative talent in Scotland.  \"We\u0026rsquore looking forward to creating a digital hub in the heart of this thriving community, which will use that talent and expertise to transform the BBC, not only in Scotland \u0026ndash but throughout the UK.\"  In its final judgement on the new channel, Ofcom says: \"We recognise that there are uncertainties about the take-up of the new channel and the content it will include.  \"However, we are satisfied the BBC has shown its proposal will deliver public value by broadening the options available to viewers in Scotland, providing a greater Scottish -focus in its news coverage and delivering more content designed to reflect the lives of people in Scotland.\"  It says that any adverse impacts on competition are \"likely to be fairly limited.\"  Although it adds: \"We acknowledge that some stakeholders, particularly STV, may experience negative effects as a result of the  BBC\u0026rsquos proposal.  \"However, taking these impacts on rivals into account, we do not believe that the proposed channel is likely to have a negative impact on citizens and consumers.\"  The director of BBC Scotland, Donalda MacKinnon, said: \"Bringing another 60 highly-trained technology roles to Scotland, on top of the 50-plus we already have, is a sign of the BBC\u0026rsquos commitment to spreading our investment across the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-gamble-for-the-snp-in-asking-voters-too-many-complex-questions","story":"              MONEY, as we know, never sleeps. The former editor of the Daily Record, Murray Foote, has revealed that, on the eve of the independence referendum in 2014, he was deluged by requests from financial businesses and hedge funds desperate for advance knowledge of the title\u0026rsquos eve-of-vote opinion poll. With commendable directness he told them to get lost. Others may not have been so punctilious. Analysis of currency movements by financial website Bloomberg suggests that hedge funds made a fortune from insider dealing over the Brexit referendum in by trading on unpublished exit polls. It\u0026rsquos being called the great Brexit short.  Well, the hedgies and short-sellers could be in for another couple of bumper shorts now that the SNP is edging closer to endorsing not just another independence referendum but also one on Brexit. Referendum-fatigued voters may quail at the thought of two repeat referendums but the indications are that the Scottish Government is moving rapidly in the direction of backing the People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit. The Brexit minister, Michael Russell, and the Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, have both made \u0026ldquoI-am-not-opposed statements in the past week, which suggests that they support another vote on Europe, even if their leader has yet to make her position clear.  There has been an intense debate in the SNP over a second EU referendum, with influential former advisers like Kevin Pringle and Noel Dolan advising the First Minister that she has a moral and political duty to lead the opposition to Brexit, Labour having lost the plot on Europe. The argument is that Scots voted by 62 per cent to 38% in favour of Remain and they should be represented by the Scottish Government. They have despaired at Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos apparent willingness to accept a special deal on access to the single market as an acceptable \u0026ldquosecond best to EU membership.  It\u0026rsquos understandable that Ms Sturgeon has been somewhat resistant to these representations. She\u0026rsquos already under pressure from the \u0026ldquomandate tendency in her party to call the second independence referendum forthwith, on the grounds that the \u0026ldquotriple-lock mandate she won after last year\u0026rsquos Holyrood vote is time limited. But, having called a referendum and then uncalled it only a year ago, she does not want to risk falling into the trap of calling another one she is likely to lose. She sees no romantic glory in heroic failure.  As for the second Europe referendum, her anxieties have been two fold. First, while Scots may be dedicated Europeans, there has been only a slight movement in the UK opinion polls toward Remain and any People\u0026rsquos Vote would have to be UK-wide. Moreover, Ms Sturgeon is bound to be uneasy at the possible precedent that might be set by holding a referendum on the deal struck by Theresa May next year. As former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars has argued, there would be similar demands in Scotland for a confirmatory vote on whatever deal the First Minister might strike with the rest of the UK after Scottish independence.  It\u0026rsquos a difficult one, made more so by the suggestion that the second Brexit and independence votes might be held simultaneously. Mr Russell has refused to rule this out in cryptic statements on the relationship between the two ballots. A double-headed referendum might on the surface make some sense. It would be more efficient to hold the two votes on the same day and they are politically closely related. Many Scottish voters only voted No in 2014 because they believed that it was the way to guarantee that Scotland remained in the EU. So why not deal with both issues on the same day?  Well, a moment\u0026rsquos thought on a double-headed referendum reveals some serious problems. For a start, voters might feel they are being railroaded by these referendums and many might refuse to vote, or even vote No, because they\u0026rsquore fed up with being asked the same questions again. There is also the problem of the referendums cancelling each other out. If voters believe that Britain is likely to rejoin the EU in ballot one would that not make them less likely to support independence in number two?  Then there are the Scots eurosceptics. It is not just the remnants of Ukip that dislike the EU. An influential strand of Nationalist opinion, led by the former minister Alex Neil, wants to stay out. Many on the Left of the Nationalist movement are unhappy at the lack of democracy in the Brussels bureaucracy and its attitude to small nations like Greece. Yes-supporting organisations like Common Weal and Radical Independence Campaign would argue that, if there is to be a multi-option referendum on Brexit, it should include an option of Scotland remaining in the European Economic Area and not being subject to the Common Agricultural Policy or the EU Court of Justice.  There is no indication that Theresa May is likely to endorse a second Scottish referendum or a second EU referendum for that matter. She said last year that \u0026ldquonow is not the time for an independence referendum and, given the chaotic state of the Brexit negotiations since then, she\u0026rsquos hardly likely to want another referendum on Europe. Westminster needs to pass a Section 30 order permitting Scotland to hold a constitutional referendum and there is not a cat in hell\u0026rsquos chance of that happening at present.  Nor is there much momentum behind the People\u0026rsquos Vote, despite 100,000 marching in London, because Labour remains opposed.  So this may all seem rather academic. But it is right to look at these questions because politics is in such a fluid state that almost anything is possible in the next couple of years. The UK Government might fall and there might be a \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit, which would generate a UK-wide revulsion at the whole project. There are signs that Scottish No-voting opinion-formers are reconsidering independence. The SNP is right to make contingency plans.  There is a vacuum in UK politics and Ms Sturgeon could perform a valuable leadership role in leading the opposition to Brexit, in time. However, she should be careful about voter tolerance. The money men may love referendums but there\u0026rsquos no sign that Scottish voters have yet regained their enthusiasm for being handed complex, divisive questions that the politicians can\u0026rsquot resolve."},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-demand-policy-changes-as-well-as-new-faces","story":"              JEANE Freeman came under attack within minutes of being confirmed as Health Secretary yesterday, as Labour raised a previous briefing against a nurse.  Mr Freeman was accused last year of contributing to a smear against an audience member who challenged Nicola Sturgeon in a BBC TV general election debate.  Mr Freeman and SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC had appeared on the show to defend the party\u0026rsquos record, describing themselves as the \u0026lsquospin girls\u0026rsquo.  Mr Cherry wrongly claimed nurse Claire Austin, who had attacked Ms Sturgeon over NHS pay and said she had been forced to use a foodbank, was the wife of a Tory councillor.  She later apologised for the remark, which had been circulating on social media.  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who had been sitting next to the pair in the BBC\u0026rsquos spin room, said Ms Freeman had encouraged Ms Cherry to make the claim on air.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is surprising that Nicola Sturgeon has appointed the person behind smearing a nurse who had the guts to challenge the First Minister during the election television debate.  \u0026ldquoThere are huge challenges in the health portfolio, especially in terms of funding and staffing. We need a Health Secretary that is going to support staff and stand-up for patients.  The instant attack was a sign the opposition do not intend to be deflected by the reshuffle.  The other parties said the new faces would mean little if they were not accompanied by new ideas and new priorities from the government.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said the government was \u0026ldquoout of touch and out of ideas.  She said: \u0026ldquoOn the day Nicola Sturgeon chose to shake up her government, she had to shelve her flagship Bill to reform the education system and oversaw the worst cancer waiting times on record.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile the economy secretary has been booted from his job to plan a referendum campaign, which says something about Keith Brown\u0026rsquos performance or the SNP\u0026rsquos priorities - or most likely both.  \u0026ldquoThis reshuffle is long overdue but the real change Scotland wants and needs won\u0026rsquot come from changing the odd Cabinet Secretary - it will come from changing the government.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added: \u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required. If the change in the ministerial team is not matched by a change of policy then our NHS will continue to decline.  Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: \u0026ldquoTwo years on from the Holyrood election in which the SNP lost their majority, the need for bold action from Scottish Ministers has never been greater.  \u0026ldquoGreen MSPs have been leading the change in this session of parliament, influencing budgets, the income tax system and social security legislation. We\u0027ll continue to bring constructive challenge to the new ministerial team.\""},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago. Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing.

Scottish Conservative MP Mr Clark had canvassed locals to gauge their views on traffic and to ask if they thought a link to the upgraded and fully dualled A96 would help to ease pressure on the A947 through the village.                                                    Responses suggested that people felt that drivers do not pay enough attention to the 30mph speed limit through the centre of the town, while there are concerns that traffic congestion could lead to accidents.        The survey showed that 60% of those who responded had concerns about congestion on the A947, 63% said that public transport was unsatisfactory while 53% backed ‘Option Q’ for the A96 dualling. Mr Clark, who has been a vocal supporter of ‘Option Q’ for the A96, one of several still under consideration by Transport Scotland, said the survey was a useful exercise.He said: “I have talked to a lot of constituents on the doorsteps in Newmachar but I thought the survey was a good way of getting the views of more people.“I am grateful to those that have taken the time to respond.                                                                                                        “The results clearly show that there is concern locally about congestion on the A947 and that many residents believe drivers are not paying enough heed to the speed limit.“The congested nature of the town centre leads some to believe it is only a matter of time before there is an accident.“The dualling of the A96 provides an opportunity to ease the pressure on the A947.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 5:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 5:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 5:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The project also details Avoch\u0026rsquos fishing heritage, and more information on this can be found on panels at the harbour and among the \"streeties\" \u0026ndash the rows of old fishermen\u0026rsquos cottages.Funding for the new project was provided by Avoch Heritage Association in recognition of the work AKCC is doing to promote the village and its historical significance.The community council\u0026rsquos chairwoman Sarah Dunton said: \"Volunteers from AKCC carried out the restoration work on the wooden frame and also created the updated information panel.\u0026nbsp\"It is a testament to the great team spirit existing within AKCC.\u0026nbsp\"We are very grateful to Avoch Heritage Association for generously funding this project.\u0026nbsp\"It will encourage not just residents of Avoch and Killen but also visitors to the Black Isle to enjoy the beautiful scenery and wildlife surrounding us.\"Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 5:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.
