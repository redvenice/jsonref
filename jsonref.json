She spent time in New York before working as a senior policy adviser for Tony Blair’s government.During her time as a member of the Labour Party, Ardern has been a strong advocate for children, women and the right to have meaning work for every New Zealander.After becoming the MP for the Auckland electorate Mount Albert in 2017 and Leader of the Labour Party in the same year, she was elected PM on October 19 after First Leader Winston Peters announced a coalition. #JacindaMania ensued.Jacinda became New Zealand’s third Prime Minister after Jenny Shipley (1997-1999) and Helen Clark (1999-2008). Months later, she announced that she was pregnant and Winston Peters would take on the role of Acting Prime Minister for six weeks after the birth.      In a statement, the New Zealand Prime Minister added: \u0027I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people.’Ahead of her leave, PM Ardern had been vocal about her six week departure and said ‘The thing to keep in mind is: I’m not dead.’However, Winston Peters has been causing a stir since the day that she left Wellington and lodged a privacy breach lawsuit against a government department, scuttled a major piece of Labour policy and attacked the leadership of New Zealand’s largest company.Although some believe that the deputy will do a good job, others are pessimistic due to the minister often being described as a populist. However, Peters has been hailed a ‘kingmaker’ after forming the coalition government and merging the centre-left and centre-right political parties.      ‘For young women, the example Ardern is setting is an affirmation that they too can expect to have that choice. For young men, Gayford being the full time carer of a baby sends a powerful message that they too can exercise that choice.‘New Zealand is known for being, by and large, a socially progressive country. Ardern is its third female prime minister it has had three female governors general and women have held significant positions across the public and private spheres. 125 years ago, it became the first country where women won the right to vote.‘Now it is breaking new ground with a prime minister giving birth and her partner becoming a stay-at-home father. But in the context of New Zealand, this is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Overwhelmingly positive interest across the political spectrum is being taken in the addition to the first family.‘What lessons are there in this for our world? In my view, New Zealand is showing that no doors are closed to women, that having a baby while being prime minister can be managed, and that it’s acceptable for male partners to be full-time carers. This is very positive role modelling for the empowerment of women and for gender equality.’AMC movie subscription launched to rival MoviePassFortnite Season 4 Week 8 challenges: What they are and how to solve themWho is Dedrick Williams?

It’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. \u0027Texting, sexting, all this takes place. Mobile phones go off in classrooms, disrupting lessons. Ban them.‘If children want to use a phone in an emergency they can use the school phone.’          If implemented, the ban would mean punishments for pupils who disobey - and in extreme instances could even result in court action against parentsIn France, the government has said inidual schools should decide how they will enforce the ban.It has been suggested that pupils could hand in their phones at the start of each school day and receive them back at the end of the day.This would mean children could still have their devices during the journeys to and from school, which they may need for safety reasons.Current Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman is also throwing her weight behind school leaders who ban the devices, telling the Festival that the place of smartphones in the classroom is ‘dubious at best’.          Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in lawHowever, Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in law.During his wide-ranging discussion, Mr Wilshaw also angering teachers by saying there are some who ‘knock off at 3.30’ and are ‘lazy’.‘There is an education establishment out there that doesn’t like change, doesn’t like people like me saying “you’ve got some people in your own profession who are lazy and feckless and you need to get rid of them”,’ he said.‘They don’t like that. There is an education establishment that doesn’t like change and reform.’Sir Michael suggested that the teaching profession can be ‘defensive’ and would say that all teachers are hard-working and professional.‘They’re not,’ he said.‘I’ve been teaching for 43 years, head teacher for over 30. Not all teachers are professional, not all teachers are committed, not all teachers do their best.’It is the job of a head teacher to identify those that do their best, and those that do not, he added.However, Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ‘Teachers work more unpaid overtime than any other profession, much of it unnecessary work driven by the fear of Ofsted inspections.‘Sir Michael Wilshaw significantly contributed to an atmosphere in schools where it is presumed that something is not done unless it is written down and documented.‘This culture of low trust is one of the major factors driving teachers from the profession, and this is lowering standards of education in England.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/08/1806486500000514-0-image-a-25_1529481474909.jpg","title":"Novice trader accidentally makes 9m practice account turns real","story":"A novice trader made £9m after his practice account turned out to be realIt was not until he placed bets on £880million of futures, running up a loss of more than £880,000, that he realised he was dealing with real money. A panicked Traore carried on buying and, after building up a £3.8billion position, he managed to turn the loss into a profit of £8.8million.Dixons Carphone posts profits plunge in wake of major cyber...Housebuilder Berkeley unveils profit jump but warns on...Will you get a windfall from Equitable Life? More than...Could you invest in British business on the cheap?

The animals are put into a chamber where concentrations build up slowly, depriving them of oxygen.Because of its inert qualities, the gas is also used in meat packaging, preventing the growth of micro-organisms which depend on oxygen, and prolonging the freshness of packaged meat.Its use explains why the shortage of the gas is causing such alarm in the meat industry, with chicken-producing plants warning of imminent shortages in supermarkets and one major plant said to have only enough CO2 for one more day\u0027s production. The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, where some 2.2 million chickens are consumed daily, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days.No chicken tonight: After fizzy drinks and beer now Britain...Pubs could run dry of beer and fizzy drinks as Britain is...Share this articleBut a shortage of CO2 gas will also affect a wide variety of foods, from cooked and fresh meat and ready meals through to pre-packaged salads, the British Meat Processors Association warns.Carbon dioxide is widely used in the fruit and vegetable industry to keep food fresh while it is being stored and transported.As they ripen, fruit and vegetables take in oxygen and \u0027breathe\u0027 out carbon dioxode. By flooding the sheds they are stored in with CO2, the amount of oxygen is reduced which means they take less in, and ripening is put on hold. The gas also helps lessen the damage caused by chilling during transport while moulds and insects are killed.          Many mass-produced beers undergo \u0027forced\u0027 carbonisation, in which the gas is pumped in to produce its fizz. The same happens with carbonated soft drinks. File photoBut although the most immediate impact of this shortage will be felt in the food and drink industries, CO2 is a crucial compound in manufacturing as well. Fire extinguishers contain frozen carbon dioxide because it smothers fires and won\u0027t burn.It\u0027s used to make plastics, in water treatment plants, in the assembly of electronic circuit boards, in the oil industry, in the manufacture of chemicals... in fact, it has an extraordinary number of applications.Which makes it all the more staggering that we are running short of CO2, which forms 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere by volume, too small to make extraction commercially viable. So how did this crisis come about?The reason is that the bulk of the CO2 used commercially is a by-product from ammonia production. If ammonia plants did not sell the gas, they would have to find some way of disposing it.It makes sense, therefore, for beer and food and other industries to source most of their carbon dioxide from ammonia plants – with smaller quantities coming from the production of bio-ethanol, a \u0027green\u0027 fuel made from crops. The trouble is that ammonia plants often shut for maintenance during the summer. The main use for ammonia is to make agricultural fertilisers, and demand from farmers is at its lowest at this time of year as crops are by now well established.Summer also happens to be when the production of beer and soft drinks peaks so there is often some kind of supply crunch around June.The problem has been compounded by a fall in global ammonia prices. The British fertiliser industry is finding it cheaper to source ammonia from abroad so some UK production has been put on hold.At present, only one large plant in Britain is believed to be producing ammonia and, therefore, carbon dioxide. The shortage exposes just how vulnerable UK manufacturing is to the availability of raw materials.We think of manufacturing as being a global industry. Yet when it comes to hard-to-transport goods such as CO2, industry is still heavily reliant on local sources.The same is true of beer. A remarkable number of them are brewed in Britain. Who would have guessed that when you swig a can of \u0027Danish\u0027 Carlsberg you are drinking a product brewed in Northampton?Just as most European countries had far better gas storage facilities than Britain to cope with the Beast from the East, so too are they better protected against the shortage of CO2. With a less-depleted industrial base, they have access to more plants supplying the gas.All of which points to the folly of letting our nation become dependent on foreign supplies of important goods such as CO2. And which means that if Harry Kane does end up lifting the World Cup, we might have to celebrate with water or good old-fashioned bitter, which isn\u0027t made with CO2.While the Germans drown their sorrows with lager, full of fizz made with their own carbon dioxide which won\u0027t have run out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/01/05438E7B000003E8-0-image-m-20_1529542733772.jpg","title":"Englands nearly lager fizzy drinks","story":"    Football fans face some rather flat World Cup celebrations as beer taps could be turned off within days.

Stock pictureThe price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £500 a tonne today — and it’s an industry now worth £140 million.And rather than being unpicked and rewoven, as you might imagine, around half of old clothes you take to a charity shop or retailer are actually sold on — mainly in Eastern Europe and Africa.John Lewis says this is the case with its scheme: the bought-back clothes will either be resold or recycled, but the trial is at too early a stage to give expected percentages in each case.What’s more, charities say donations are falling in the face of this High Street competition, and that criminals are also being drawn to the high prices — there’s reports of donations being stolen.Many firms have sprung up offering to collect clothes door-to-door for free. Shipping them off to be sold isn’t the end of it, though.Alan Wheeler, director of the Textile Recycling Association, says: ‘Just because a retailer collects garments doesn’t mean the problem is solved. Where do they go?‘Typically clothes go through a sorting programme and maybe 50 per cent will be sold for export.‘The rest will need to be recycled: sometimes they are cut for wiping cloths, depending on the material, or they are used to manufacture heat and sound insulation or filling materials such as mattress or duvet fillings.‘Some textiles are used to make “shoddy”, a wool-substitute yarn which can make blankets used in relief work. Recycled fibres can also be used to manufacture the interior linings in cars.‘Even if the used clothing is of good enough quality to be reused, eventually it will wear out and have to be either recycled or disposed of.‘Of course, it would be much better to be able to recycle these worn out items, so it would be good if new garments were designed with recycling in mind.’And in terms of the plastics used in clothes, controversially Wheeler says that if the public turned against polyster in favour of cotton, it would only be swapping one big environmental problem for another.          India Sturgis with the clothes mountain at the Oxfam Wastewise recycling centre in Batley, West Yorkshire Conventional cotton production can cause huge environmental problems. It typically takes 20,000 litres of water to produce just one kilogram of cotton.Polyester — a synthetic man-made polymer and mostly non-biodegradable plastic — is used in 60 per cent of our garments. The most common is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the same plastic used in soft drink and ketchup bottles.In many respects, polyester’s popularity is a no-brainer. It’s cheap, lightweight, shape-retaining, easy to blend with other materials and long-lasting. Manufacturing techniques have become so sophisticated that it can now be spun finer than a human hair.Forget the rough, thick polyester shirts of old — some modern polyesters rival even the most expensive natural fibres in quality.Polyester or otherwise, what’s the best way to recycle your clothes?The new app reGAIN might offer consumers something different to the High Street take-back schemes. The idea is simple — choose a minimum of ten items to package in a cardboard box and use the app to locate your closest drop-off point.You receive a discount code from the partner of your choice to go towards your next purchase. Above all, Wheeler prefers the good old-fashioned method of taking clothes to the local charity shop — where the money they raise will go to good causes.But what happens to your bag of old clothes once you drop it off?Most of us do not appreciate what a massive and sophisticated operation lies behind your humble, High Street charity shop.I paid a visit to Oxfam’s colossal clothing sorting centre, a 90,000 sq ft former bed-making factory — bigger than a football pitch — on the fringes of Batley in Yorkshire, to find out.Here any excess clothing from its charity shops is sorted — and the complexity of dealing with our fast fashion habit is clear.On the morning I visit, the deliveries are rolling in. Endless steel conveyor belts send streams of black bin bags to workers who sort their contents by hand.Out come Hobbs dresses, M\u0026ampS cashmere cardigans, babies’ bibs, and old shirts and suits, which are flung into industrial wheelie bins for compressing and packing.The walls heave with hay-bale-sized bags of clothes stacked against them and there’s a smell of musty attic fibres in the air.Some 17 tonnes of clothing a day are sorted here. More than half is sent to Frip Ethique, the charity’s social enterprise project in Senegal providing work for 40 local men and women and stock for market traders.

Nothing — not one sock — gets sent to landfill.If items are too damp or dirty to process — around a minuscule 2 per cent of overall donations — they’re incinerated locally to produce energy for 400 Yorkshire homes.Despite this ingenuity, Lorraine Needham-Reid, the site’s manager of production, is still concerned about our wasteful attitude.‘I’m absolutely stunned by what people throw away,’ she says. ‘We see brand new items sent here, never worn, with tags still in. It is scary what people chuck out.’So what of the clothes we send to council recycling banks that are found on urban streets or in supermarket car parks?Sixty per cent is exported overseas for resale in second-hand clothing markets to countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Benin, Ghana and Togo.But this troubles Dr Andy Brooks, a lecturer in development geography at King’s College and author of Clothing Poverty, a book about fast fashion and the second-hand clothing sector.‘People think their old clothes are most likely to be sold in a local charity shop,’ he says. ‘However, there is a large international trade in used clothing that’s hidden from view.’‘Poor countries have had their markets flooded by second-hand garments.‘Factories in African countries including Ghana and Zambia have had to close down because they are uncompetitive.‘In the short term, cheap used clothing seems to be good for poor African consumers, but in the long term it harms their balance of trade and restricts industrial development.’So if recycling overseas is problematic when not overseen by an organisation such as Oxfam, and landfills equally so, could a beacon of hope be ‘fibre-to-fibre chemical recycling’ — essentially, making new garments out of old synthetic ones?Scientists have yet to find a workable method to magic synthetic clothing into new apparel — but the best attempt has so far come from outdoor clothing specialists Patagonia, who use PET clear plastic drinks bottles to make jackets, shorts and fleeces.But there are problems with taking that to the next stage, says Alan Wheeler.‘With polyester clothing you’ve got different dyes, you might have cotton threads within the item, it might have a nylon lining. Every item is different. Chemical recycling processes are looking at how to change all different polyester clothing into one homogenous product that can then be recycled easily.’ A move towards a circular clothing economy is something a few industry leaders are beginning to tentatively work towards.‘We need to slow down the amount we produce and encourage people to keep and use their clothes for longer,’ says Wheeler.‘The whole notion that celebrities and royals like the Duchess of Cambridge are radically “recycling” clothes when they’re spotted wearing the same item more than once is very frustrating. It should be considered normal practice,’ he adds.Wheeler points to the ‘elephant in the room’ when it comes to recycling and clothing retailers. ‘It is difficult for them to be sustainable because their survival is dependent on us buying more and more clothes,’ he says.‘I would argue that they need to encourage the public to buy less, pay more (that way they would pay their workers more, too) and design items that are made to last.’Currently consumer pressure for new garments means companies produce clothes faster to lower standards — which are then less able to withstand repeat wear.According to a recent report from WRAP, the average piece of clothing in the UK lasts for 3.3 years before being discarded.Other research puts the life of UK garments at 2.2 years.For a younger demographic, you can probably halve that. But the experts want us to do better than that.So it’s a case of step away from the shopping basket (literally or virtually), rewear what you already own, and recycle those you don’t — this way you save the planet as well as your pennies. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/08/4D4E9DEF00000578-5872247-image-m-2_1529651789590.jpg","title":"Higher quality clothes leading rise moth infestations Rentokil","story":"Britons buying higher-quality clothes made from natural materials such as wool and silk have led to a rise in moth infestations because they contain a protein called keratin (file photo: clothes moth)           Giant sex-hungry moths have been spotted across the country in recent weeks as adult moths emerge for the first time (pictured: giant moth spotted in Birkenhead)Jelly and I scream!

The sawfly has evolved the same strategy: exploit the speed advantage of asexual reproduction and avoid the risk of not finding a mate.\u0027Scientists are now asking people to report sightings of the unmistakable zigzag pattern, to track the sawfly\u0027s spread and help scientists secure definitive evidence of its presence in the form of adult insects, larvae or pupae.It has also prompted renewed calls for action to protect the UK\u0027s woodlands and wildlife.          The discovery has raised concerns it could pose another blow to the UK\u0027s elms, which have already been devastated by Dutch elm disease, and threaten wildlife that rely on the treesDr Nick Atkinson, senior conservation advisor for the Woodland Trust, said: \u0027This could be another blow to the elm population, following the widespread devastation caused by Dutch elm disease, which began in the 1970s and continues even today.\u0027By continuing to allow the import of trees and other living materials we are risking the health of our natural landscapes and our own well-being as a consequence.\u0027Action is needed now. Government, with buy-in from the forestry and horticulture sectors, and even supermarkets that sell plants, need to help minimise further risks to our native trees and woodlands.\u0027The zigzag elm sawfly rarely kills elm trees alone but rids them of their leaves, which are needed for photosynthesis.This makes them far more vulnerable to being killed by other problems such as Dutch elm disease, which still exists in Britain. Because of Dutch elm disease, many of the surviving elm trees in Britain are young, which puts them at greater risk from the sawfly.At the last count in the 1990s, there were estimated to be roughly five million elm trees in Britain."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/08/4D82D7CE00000578-5873237-image-a-12_1529651461080.jpg","title":"Londons Charing Cross station evacuated","story":"    Armed police attended Charing Cross this morning when it was reported that a man with an explosive device was on the tracks           Armed police rushed to Charing Cross station in the capital\u0027s centre this morning as a man claimed to have a bomb on the tracks     Police were called to Charing Cross station amid reports that a man on the tracks had a bombNetwork Rail said the mainline station, which caters for services arriving from the south east, was not evacuated, and arrivals and departures were not affected.   Passengers stuck on Northern Line trains faced huge delays to their journeys, as they were stuck on packed carriages waiting outside Charing Cross. Eyewitness Alan Buckingham tweeted: \u0027Loads of police including armed response at Charing Cross.

Ma Larkin (also next to Jason) was played by Pam Ferris      H.E. Bates (Herbert Ernest Bates) was born in Rushden, Northamptonshire, in 1905.After grammar school, he joined the Northampton Chronicle at the age of 16 but realised it wasn\u0027t for him and left two months later.A two-year stint as a factory clerk followed, and then he began writing in earnest. His first novel was The Two Sisters - which led to him being fired from the factory when his boss found him working on it in company time.It was eventually published in 1926. Other shorts stories and novels would follow - many focusing on his love for the countryside.During the Second World War, he achieved acclaim after being commissioned to write stories for the RAF - including How Sleep the Brave (1943) and Fair Stood the Wind for France (1944).He would go on to write The Darling Buds of May in 1958, featuring the loveable Larkin family.The first part of his autobiography, The Vanished World, was published in 1969, and part two, The Blossoming World, in 1971 - three years before his death.

The designer horses are sometimes referred to as \u0027Disney\u0027 horses, because they look like animals from the cartoons (pictured) with their pulled-in noses and popping-out eyes          Miss Fowler examining a horse\u0027s mouth at work in WiganIn October last year an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face.The owners of the nine month old colt was said to resemble cartoon horses in Disney films Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin.Miss Fowler said: \u0027People seem to like these very dainty, pulled-in faces but that gives them breathing difficulties and dental problems. I\u0027m seeing these deformities on a weekly basis.\u0027One problem is there isn\u0027t enough space for their teeth because their mouths are smaller.          In October last year it emerged an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum (pictured) was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face          Example of extreme breeding, more usually seen in cats and dogs, can often be seen in the Arabian horse pedigree like Apalo, pictured, grandfather to El Rey Magnum\u0027As a result the teeth grow everywhere and, in some cases, they\u0027ll make a whole space of their own behind the oral cavity because they can\u0027t fit in their mouths.\u0027The x-ray from a horse I recently treated shows clearly that her teeth can\u0027t fit properly.\u0027One is sitting behind her oral cavity, another has twisted 90 degrees because it wouldn\u0027t fit.\u0027While human teeth are simple to extract, horse teeth can be anything from 8cm to 15cm long depending on the size of the horse. To extract a horse\u0027s tooth requires very big surgery.\u0027One pony I recently treated is not expected to live very long at all now and she\u0027s only six. Selective breeding can certainly decrease life expectancy.\u0027          Pedigree horses bred to have a concave face, pictured, has been described as ‘horrific’ by veterinary experts.Aside from the difficult situation of seeing their horse in pain, owners are often faced with bills reaching into the thousands due to the complexity of surgery.If surgery is needed it can be intense and \u0027massively risky\u0027 if the horse needs anaesthetic.Miss Fowler, who owns three horses herself, said: \u0027If a horse needs an operation the vet bills can be in the thousands. It is a much more serious procedure for horses than humans.\u0027Ethically vets have to decide what is best for the horse because surgery is massively invasive.\u0027Most owners decide they don\u0027t want to put their horses through it.\u0027Horses have a one in 100 chance of death from general anaesthetic, compared with humans who have a one in 100,000 chance.\u0027Any surgery is massively risky. It\u0027s very, very intense.\u0027She claims it is often a horse\u0027s failure to show pain, as it is taught in the wild, that means owners are oblivious to the level of pain or suffering they are going through.As a result, it can already be too late by the time they visit the vet.\u0027Usually the owners don\u0027t know their horses are in pain. Horses are prey animals - they don\u0027t show pain,\u0027 she said.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing how severe the problems can get before the horses show any signs of pain or weight loss.\u0027Pain is weakness in the wild and they would get eaten so often the problems are found when it is much too late to help the animal.\u0027When found early, the owners are very surprised to find their animal is in pain.\u0027The practice owner has now urged breeders to be more responsible, calling on them to consider functionality and what is best for the horse.Miss Fowler added: \u0027I think the focus needs to be on breeders as well as owners or buyers.\u0027The breeders pushing for the extreme features that are causing the health issues are certainly irresponsible.\u0027They breed for profit and create horses wanted for being pretty as opposed to functioning or healthy. That\u0027s the main source of the problem and it\u0027s definitely getting worse.\u0027But while dogs can live on a soft diet without teeth if need be, horses need to eat grass for up to 20 hours a day.\u0027People need to consider functionality and what is best for the horse. This is a massive problem in the horse world.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/11/4D83B75300000578-0-image-m-13_1529661727209.jpg","title":"Patrice Evra likened Carlton Fresh Prince bow tie","story":"    The French star\u0027s bizarre outfit choice was compared to something a fast food worker would wear by this Canadian Liverpool fans\u0027 account          The outfit was likened to this one worn by EastEnder\u0027s character Frank Butcher as he tried to romance partner Pat       \u0027Everyone\u0027s hair is still holding up well\u0027: Girlfriend\u0027s...\u0027What did I just watch?\u0027 Social media lights up after Iran...Share this articleOthers joked that he had \u0027lost a bet\u0027, with some social media users theorising that his mother had dressed him. The 37-year-old\u0027s fashion choices weren\u0027t the only aspect of his appearance to be criticised, as the pundit was slammed for \u0027manspreading\u0027 and slouching.

It’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. \u0027Texting, sexting, all this takes place. Mobile phones go off in classrooms, disrupting lessons.

File photoBut the invisible, odourless gas, which we produce every time we breathe, is also essential for other everyday products.Many abattoirs use it to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughter. The animals are put into a chamber where concentrations build up slowly, depriving them of oxygen.Because of its inert qualities, the gas is also used in meat packaging, preventing the growth of micro-organisms which depend on oxygen, and prolonging the freshness of packaged meat.Its use explains why the shortage of the gas is causing such alarm in the meat industry, with chicken-producing plants warning of imminent shortages in supermarkets and one major plant said to have only enough CO2 for one more day\u0027s production. The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, where some 2.2 million chickens are consumed daily, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days.No chicken tonight: After fizzy drinks and beer now Britain...Pubs could run dry of beer and fizzy drinks as Britain is...Share this articleBut a shortage of CO2 gas will also affect a wide variety of foods, from cooked and fresh meat and ready meals through to pre-packaged salads, the British Meat Processors Association warns.Carbon dioxide is widely used in the fruit and vegetable industry to keep food fresh while it is being stored and transported.As they ripen, fruit and vegetables take in oxygen and \u0027breathe\u0027 out carbon dioxode. By flooding the sheds they are stored in with CO2, the amount of oxygen is reduced which means they take less in, and ripening is put on hold. The gas also helps lessen the damage caused by chilling during transport while moulds and insects are killed.          Many mass-produced beers undergo \u0027forced\u0027 carbonisation, in which the gas is pumped in to produce its fizz. The same happens with carbonated soft drinks. File photoBut although the most immediate impact of this shortage will be felt in the food and drink industries, CO2 is a crucial compound in manufacturing as well. Fire extinguishers contain frozen carbon dioxide because it smothers fires and won\u0027t burn.It\u0027s used to make plastics, in water treatment plants, in the assembly of electronic circuit boards, in the oil industry, in the manufacture of chemicals... in fact, it has an extraordinary number of applications.Which makes it all the more staggering that we are running short of CO2, which forms 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere by volume, too small to make extraction commercially viable. So how did this crisis come about?The reason is that the bulk of the CO2 used commercially is a by-product from ammonia production. If ammonia plants did not sell the gas, they would have to find some way of disposing it.It makes sense, therefore, for beer and food and other industries to source most of their carbon dioxide from ammonia plants – with smaller quantities coming from the production of bio-ethanol, a \u0027green\u0027 fuel made from crops. The trouble is that ammonia plants often shut for maintenance during the summer. The main use for ammonia is to make agricultural fertilisers, and demand from farmers is at its lowest at this time of year as crops are by now well established.Summer also happens to be when the production of beer and soft drinks peaks so there is often some kind of supply crunch around June.The problem has been compounded by a fall in global ammonia prices. The British fertiliser industry is finding it cheaper to source ammonia from abroad so some UK production has been put on hold.At present, only one large plant in Britain is believed to be producing ammonia and, therefore, carbon dioxide. The shortage exposes just how vulnerable UK manufacturing is to the availability of raw materials.We think of manufacturing as being a global industry. Yet when it comes to hard-to-transport goods such as CO2, industry is still heavily reliant on local sources.The same is true of beer. A remarkable number of them are brewed in Britain. Who would have guessed that when you swig a can of \u0027Danish\u0027 Carlsberg you are drinking a product brewed in Northampton?Just as most European countries had far better gas storage facilities than Britain to cope with the Beast from the East, so too are they better protected against the shortage of CO2. With a less-depleted industrial base, they have access to more plants supplying the gas.All of which points to the folly of letting our nation become dependent on foreign supplies of important goods such as CO2. And which means that if Harry Kane does end up lifting the World Cup, we might have to celebrate with water or good old-fashioned bitter, which isn\u0027t made with CO2.While the Germans drown their sorrows with lager, full of fizz made with their own carbon dioxide which won\u0027t have run out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/00/4D80598100000578-5871989-India_Sturgis_with_the_clothes_mountain_at_the_Oxfam_Wastewise_r-a-16_1529622804364.jpg","title":"Your unwanted clothes valuable earth going on","story":"    Help or hindrance: Academics say donations can restrict new retail economies in developing economies. Stock pictureThe price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £500 a tonne today — and it’s an industry now worth £140 million.And rather than being unpicked and rewoven, as you might imagine, around half of old clothes you take to a charity shop or retailer are actually sold on — mainly in Eastern Europe and Africa.John Lewis says this is the case with its scheme: the bought-back clothes will either be resold or recycled, but the trial is at too early a stage to give expected percentages in each case.What’s more, charities say donations are falling in the face of this High Street competition, and that criminals are also being drawn to the high prices — there’s reports of donations being stolen.Many firms have sprung up offering to collect clothes door-to-door for free. Shipping them off to be sold isn’t the end of it, though.Alan Wheeler, director of the Textile Recycling Association, says: ‘Just because a retailer collects garments doesn’t mean the problem is solved. Where do they go?‘Typically clothes go through a sorting programme and maybe 50 per cent will be sold for export.‘The rest will need to be recycled: sometimes they are cut for wiping cloths, depending on the material, or they are used to manufacture heat and sound insulation or filling materials such as mattress or duvet fillings.‘Some textiles are used to make “shoddy”, a wool-substitute yarn which can make blankets used in relief work. Recycled fibres can also be used to manufacture the interior linings in cars.‘Even if the used clothing is of good enough quality to be reused, eventually it will wear out and have to be either recycled or disposed of.‘Of course, it would be much better to be able to recycle these worn out items, so it would be good if new garments were designed with recycling in mind.’And in terms of the plastics used in clothes, controversially Wheeler says that if the public turned against polyster in favour of cotton, it would only be swapping one big environmental problem for another.          India Sturgis with the clothes mountain at the Oxfam Wastewise recycling centre in Batley, West Yorkshire Conventional cotton production can cause huge environmental problems. It typically takes 20,000 litres of water to produce just one kilogram of cotton.Polyester — a synthetic man-made polymer and mostly non-biodegradable plastic — is used in 60 per cent of our garments. The most common is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the same plastic used in soft drink and ketchup bottles.In many respects, polyester’s popularity is a no-brainer. It’s cheap, lightweight, shape-retaining, easy to blend with other materials and long-lasting. Manufacturing techniques have become so sophisticated that it can now be spun finer than a human hair.Forget the rough, thick polyester shirts of old — some modern polyesters rival even the most expensive natural fibres in quality.Polyester or otherwise, what’s the best way to recycle your clothes?The new app reGAIN might offer consumers something different to the High Street take-back schemes. The idea is simple — choose a minimum of ten items to package in a cardboard box and use the app to locate your closest drop-off point.You receive a discount code from the partner of your choice to go towards your next purchase. Above all, Wheeler prefers the good old-fashioned method of taking clothes to the local charity shop — where the money they raise will go to good causes.But what happens to your bag of old clothes once you drop it off?Most of us do not appreciate what a massive and sophisticated operation lies behind your humble, High Street charity shop.I paid a visit to Oxfam’s colossal clothing sorting centre, a 90,000 sq ft former bed-making factory — bigger than a football pitch — on the fringes of Batley in Yorkshire, to find out.Here any excess clothing from its charity shops is sorted — and the complexity of dealing with our fast fashion habit is clear.On the morning I visit, the deliveries are rolling in. Endless steel conveyor belts send streams of black bin bags to workers who sort their contents by hand.Out come Hobbs dresses, M\u0026ampS cashmere cardigans, babies’ bibs, and old shirts and suits, which are flung into industrial wheelie bins for compressing and packing.The walls heave with hay-bale-sized bags of clothes stacked against them and there’s a smell of musty attic fibres in the air.Some 17 tonnes of clothing a day are sorted here. More than half is sent to Frip Ethique, the charity’s social enterprise project in Senegal providing work for 40 local men and women and stock for market traders.

Nothing — not one sock — gets sent to landfill.If items are too damp or dirty to process — around a minuscule 2 per cent of overall donations — they’re incinerated locally to produce energy for 400 Yorkshire homes.Despite this ingenuity, Lorraine Needham-Reid, the site’s manager of production, is still concerned about our wasteful attitude.‘I’m absolutely stunned by what people throw away,’ she says. ‘We see brand new items sent here, never worn, with tags still in. It is scary what people chuck out.’So what of the clothes we send to council recycling banks that are found on urban streets or in supermarket car parks?Sixty per cent is exported overseas for resale in second-hand clothing markets to countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Benin, Ghana and Togo.But this troubles Dr Andy Brooks, a lecturer in development geography at King’s College and author of Clothing Poverty, a book about fast fashion and the second-hand clothing sector.‘People think their old clothes are most likely to be sold in a local charity shop,’ he says. ‘However, there is a large international trade in used clothing that’s hidden from view.’‘Poor countries have had their markets flooded by second-hand garments.‘Factories in African countries including Ghana and Zambia have had to close down because they are uncompetitive.‘In the short term, cheap used clothing seems to be good for poor African consumers, but in the long term it harms their balance of trade and restricts industrial development.’So if recycling overseas is problematic when not overseen by an organisation such as Oxfam, and landfills equally so, could a beacon of hope be ‘fibre-to-fibre chemical recycling’ — essentially, making new garments out of old synthetic ones?Scientists have yet to find a workable method to magic synthetic clothing into new apparel — but the best attempt has so far come from outdoor clothing specialists Patagonia, who use PET clear plastic drinks bottles to make jackets, shorts and fleeces.But there are problems with taking that to the next stage, says Alan Wheeler.‘With polyester clothing you’ve got different dyes, you might have cotton threads within the item, it might have a nylon lining. Every item is different. Chemical recycling processes are looking at how to change all different polyester clothing into one homogenous product that can then be recycled easily.’ A move towards a circular clothing economy is something a few industry leaders are beginning to tentatively work towards.‘We need to slow down the amount we produce and encourage people to keep and use their clothes for longer,’ says Wheeler.‘The whole notion that celebrities and royals like the Duchess of Cambridge are radically “recycling” clothes when they’re spotted wearing the same item more than once is very frustrating. It should be considered normal practice,’ he adds.Wheeler points to the ‘elephant in the room’ when it comes to recycling and clothing retailers. ‘It is difficult for them to be sustainable because their survival is dependent on us buying more and more clothes,’ he says.‘I would argue that they need to encourage the public to buy less, pay more (that way they would pay their workers more, too) and design items that are made to last.’Currently consumer pressure for new garments means companies produce clothes faster to lower standards — which are then less able to withstand repeat wear.According to a recent report from WRAP, the average piece of clothing in the UK lasts for 3.3 years before being discarded.Other research puts the life of UK garments at 2.2 years.For a younger demographic, you can probably halve that. But the experts want us to do better than that.So it’s a case of step away from the shopping basket (literally or virtually), rewear what you already own, and recycle those you don’t — this way you save the planet as well as your pennies. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/08/4D4E9DEF00000578-5872247-image-m-2_1529651789590.jpg","title":"Higher quality clothes leading rise moth infestations Rentokil","story":"Britons buying higher-quality clothes made from natural materials such as wool and silk have led to a rise in moth infestations because they contain a protein called keratin (file photo: clothes moth)           Giant sex-hungry moths have been spotted across the country in recent weeks as adult moths emerge for the first time (pictured: giant moth spotted in Birkenhead)Jelly and I scream!

People need it, he believes, and so do nations. Much of his fiction has reflected on the loss of an American sense of purpose, the decay of the dream much of his non-fiction has told the stories of immigrants to the US who have shown the drive and generosity missing from the country as a whole. In person, as in his work, Eggers combines an openness to describing darkness and tragedy with a faith in the essential goodness of “everyday people”. He tells me that “whenever there’s a moment when people are inspired to make the world better, I get interested. I’m super corny that way.”The most recent of Eggers’s many books is The Lifters, a magic realist tale written for eight- to 12-year-olds, in which the “adults have lost hope, lost their way, and it’s the kids who say: ‘Here’s the task, let’s get to it.’” The setting is a town that used to be proudly defined by what it manufactured, but has been gutted by sadness and loss of identity. Carousel is collapsing in on itself, with sinkholes appearing everywhere it is up to children – the “lifters” – to go underground and prop up its foundations, and those of other disconsolate places around the world.The Lifters begins with Gran, a boy new to Carousel and ignored by his classmates he runs into a brick wall just to prove he exists. The only friend he makes is the enigmatic Catalina Catalan, whom he follows into the woods and one night sees disappear into a hillside. “You went into the hill,” he said. “No I didn’t,” she said … “I saw a handle in your hand … I saw a stairway … And a huge room … It was lit up like a church”. “No it wasn’t.” When Gran eventually becomes a lifter himself, the two take a journey to a convention of tunnel-dwellers deep in the Earth’s mantle and confront a force known as “the Hollows”.Catalina was the first character in his mind, the author says. He wanted to capture her knowledge that “she is solely responsible for holding up everything above ground … I am obsessed with giving kids responsibility. We want to protect them, so we give them less and less to do, but they respond to having a task. I mean, I’m not arguing for child labour, but … ” He has talked of children as “heroes in waiting, they just want to be given the opportunity to prove it”.In saying this, Eggers is drawing on his experience with “all the kids I’ve met here”: across the road from where we are talking in San Francisco is 826 Valencia, the young writers’ centre he founded in 2002, which is fronted by a shop selling pirate supplies. He asked students at the centre, and its equivalents across the US, to read The Lifters at proof stage: “They are the purest readers, because they want to be entertained, but they will also point out errors, inconsistencies.” He took all their edits. They are also discerning, he says, grasping “the connection straight away between the Hollows and the mood of the town. Children get it at a bone level they generally know where there is pain in their house, and they speak about it candidly.”It sometimes seems as though Eggers is waging a one-man war against cynicism: both of the magazines with which he is associated, McSweeney’s and the Believer, were begun as responses to a more acerbic literary culture. Certainly, he is drawn to children’s sense of wonder, enthusiasm and fun. His mother (whose original name was McSweeney) was a “pre-school teacher … brilliant at knowing what kids really felt and liked”, and his teenage years were spent as a camp counsellor and running a sports camp: communicating to kids has been central to his life. Toph, the young brother the 21-year-old Eggers looked after following their parents’ deaths – as recounted in his career-making memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius – joined the camp when he was four. Eggers trained as an illustrator, and it has felt natural “circling back” to write the clutch of children’s books that have followed his work on the screenplay of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. There is, he continues, “no more fun you can have than writing a pure adventure story for the reader that you were at 10”.Eggers has said that, as a child, all he ever wore were grey and brown clothes that his own parents not once went out in the evening that his father drank and, like Gran’s, was sometimes out of work: “I can remember feeling responsible for my mother’s happiness.” Also, at school, there was his “ludicrous” name: I was Ham and Eggers,” he has recalled. “Egghead, Egg Beater. Eggs was the nicest way anyone would put it.” But he draws directly on only two personal experiences in his depiction of Gran: the excruciating time he wet himself at school, wearing khakis, and tried to cover it up at lunch by spilling milk over himself and “the game the boys had in fifth grade when we’d form a circle and take turns to kick each other in the head”.A very early image Eggers had in writing The Lifters was a “sinkhole in the middle of Gran’s school”. The symbolism is obvious: “This country makes no lasting commitment to education funding is woefully inadequate.” In the book, teachers simply work around the yawning hole in their building, as in life they adapt to insufficient money and just “reschedule a few classes … this is how we run our public education system. Spit and glue and ScotchTape, and no leadership from DC.”But before the sinkholes in his imagination were the hills. “I grew up in the flattest part of the country, the midwest,” he says. “And the landscape of my imagination was … stormy, grey, bright green hills.” Walking with his own two children (Eggers is married to the writer Vendela Vida) in just this kind of landscape north of his home in the Bay Area, he used to share a fantasy: “What if you had a handle and you could open up a door that led inside the hillside?” It’s a variation of such classic secret-door children’s fiction as the Narnia books, “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” and Coraline. When a few years ago he spent time in another hilly part of the country, rust-belt Pennsylvania, with its “crooked houses on the slopes, pawn shops and empty storefronts”, the narrative of The Lifters – in which purpose overcomes sadness to restore pride and identity – took shape.Eggers has long written about the decline of US manufacturing, not least in his novel A Hologram for the King (Tom Hanks starred as the dispossessed hero Alan Clay in the film adaptation), and is careful not to situate The Lifters specifically in the age of Trump. Finishing the story during the runup to the presidential election, however, he “couldn’t help” inserting the detail that one potential leader of Carousel campaigns on an imaginary threat from outsiders (in this case, the outsiders are moose). The opposing candidate runs on a platform of more cash for parks and schools.The election of Trump is “just absolutely crushing for anyone with an optimistic view of our citizenry,” Eggers says. This is especially the case as his understanding of American values is closely bound up with immigration. “It wasn’t until I moved to California,” in the early 1990s, “that I was able to appreciate how profoundly enriched I am, and we all are, by every new arrival … Our strength comes from our welcome and our identity as a haven and a blank canvas that anyone is free to paint on. And I’m enraged and offended by anyone who makes this into a fearful place. Maybe that’s a patriotic thing … I always picture Trump hiding under a table, because he’s afraid of everything: he’s afraid of Mexicans, Muslims, he’s afraid of change. He’s a deeply fearful human who has never acted courageously in his life.”“Any time immigrants are villainised, scapegoated or threatened,” he continues, “it’s an outrage. It comes from a cowardly place. You have a privileged 72-year-old white man who is villainising families from war-torn countries who are coming here for a better life – that’s pure ignorance, and it’s irrational and not strong and not American.”The day before we talk, Eggers has been organising an event with Valentino Deng, the Sudanese “Lost Boy” who found his way to the US, and whose traumatic experiences he channelled into What Is the What, a book Barack Obama advised every one of his White House aides to read. His second interview-based book to explore how outsiders remake America, Zeitoun, is the story of a Muslim house-painter from the Syrian town of Jableh, who helped the victims of Hurricane Katrina but was arrested as a terrorist. This year, Eggers published The Monk of Mokha, about the entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali, who narrowly escaped Yemen’s civil war, fleeing in a fishing boat with two cases of coffee. The stories of Abdulrahman Zeitoun and Alkhanshali turned out to be more complicated in real life, but Eggers says he is drawn to people, such as the latter, who are “so driven by an idea, and their ability to realise it, that they attract other humans to their light”.When dwelling on America’s loss of a clear sense of identity, Eggers often refers to the cancellation of the space shuttle programme. He has always been a space enthusiast and attended the final launch in 2011, an experience he tells me he found “very painful”. “Everyone was crying,” he has said: “The shuttle was such a powerful emblem of a sense of optimism and a can-do spirit.” The space programme finds a place in both A Hologram for the King and the less accomplished Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever?“It reminds me,” he says, “of what happened to the tobacco companies, which I covered as a journalist in the 1990s, where after a point nobody believed anything they said. If you smoked, you knew exactly what you were getting into – all the risks. You knew the companies were evil, but you did it because you were addicted. Well, people are addicted to social media. They know the companies are voraciously profit-driven and completely uninterested in privacy or any rights of the inidual. But they carry on using the tools because their friends are using them and there’s nothing better.“Facebook is still Facebook. It went through a little dip how many people deleted their accounts? People have a high tolerance for being surveilled. I think it will have to get even more poisonous and destructive before there’s a real change. Social media separates and isolates us … Any time you’re next to an actual human … you can find common ground. Humans in person are kind and giving and generous. But online, you see an inversion of every good quality … We are at our best in person.”The response of Eggers, who remains an untiring and inspiring literary activist, is to focus on personal stories. He mentions a young Ethiopian-American girl he has just encountered at one of the tutoring centres: “Any time you’re cynical about the world, meet a first-generation kid who writes about what she’s grateful for.” He admits he has found the last couple of years “crushing to a point when I do wake up paralysed sometimes” – and his next novel is “incredibly dark” he has been wading through “terrible footage and files”. But writing children’s stories has helped. Plus his belief in inidual drive and purpose is unwavering. “On this block,” he says, “I could introduce you to nine people whose stories would make interesting books … If you’re listening, the stories are never-ending” •• The Lifters is published by Scholastic.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2621b2941d40b9d351d5f80300c58cda8cb4665c/0_11_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb45a6dac4e75fd1f0f572daa44ae27d","title":"opec meeting oil supply greece hails historic debt deal business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, as oil ministers meet in Vienna and Greece moves closer to exiting its bailout programmeIf you own an Aston Martin, then you’re probably not short of a few bob already.

That deal has been crucial in keeping output down, and prices up.While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to ease supply curbs, other members including Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Venezuela are against such a move. With Iran already storming out of preparatory discussions yesterday, investors should fasten their seat belts in preparation for potential fireworks today.If Iran continues to reject the deal to raise output and gathers support from other cartel members, talks are at risk of ending in an impasse. Such an undesirable outcome is likely to create uncertainty and will spark fears over the future of OPEC’s 18-month agreement with Russia to limit production. A market-friendly outcome could be a scenario where Iran makes a last-minute U-turn to cooperate, consequently allowing Saudi Arabia and Russia to move forward with a gradual production increase.Newsflash: UK supermarket chain Asda has cut its fuel prices, in response to recent drops in the oil price.Asda is shaving 2p per litre off its unleaded petrol, and 1p per litre off diesel prices.This follows a fall in crude oil prices - with Brent dropping from $80 per barrel to $74 in the last week.Motorists suffered a surge in prices on the forecourt in recent weeks, as the oil price jumped to its highest levels since 2014. Asda’s move suggests other retailers could also trim prices....Iran’s oil minister told has reporters that Opec won’t simply take instructions from Donald Trump, who has been lobbying for lower oil prices.Associated Press has the details:Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said as the group met Friday that “we are not here to receive instruction from President Trump and apply it and implement it.” Asked whether he supports increasing production, he replied: “Some of the countries are against any increase, and ask them. I am not representative of them.”As mentioned earlier, Zanganeh also said $70 per barrel was a “very good” oil price, AP adds.Back in Vienna, security officers have now emptied the Opec meeting of journalists, so the serious negotiations can get underway.Here are some photos of the main players speaking to reporters:Back in London, landlords are arriving to vote on House of Fraser’s proposal to shut half its stores and lay off 6,000 staff.Most people heading into the meeting refused to comment but those who did speak said they thought the vote would be approved.House of Fraser are making the cuts to preserve the rest of their business. If creditors reject the plan (a company voluntary arrangement), then the whole business could collapse. Saudi Arabia’s Khalid Al-Falih tells us he’s hoping to get a deal to increase production limits today.Across the conference room in Vienna, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh is also surrounded by journalists.Zanganeh is a crucial player at this meeting, having walked out of talks on a production increase yesterday.He says that this morning’s meeting with the Saudi delegation was good, and that Iran is happy with oil at $70 per barrel (Brent crude is trading at $74 today).Asked if a deal will be reached today, Zanganeh says cryptically that “we are cooking something”.Kuwait’s oil minister says he will support a production increase of one million barrel’s per day (Saudi Arabia’s goal), or less.Boom: Iraq’s oil minister has told Adam that a change in Opec’s targets will “definitely” be agreed today.No-one’s suggesting that supply targets will be reduced, so this suggests an increase will be waved through.Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih is surrounded by a gaggle of reporters seeking answers.He insists that no-one should expect to see an “immediate flood” of oil onto the market following today’s meeting.Oil supply release will be “gradual”, Al-Falih says, suggesting the impact of today’s agreement won’t be seen until the end of the summer. Al-Falih is talking about a ‘nominal’ increase in production of one million barrels per day, split between Opec and non-Opec members.

If he gets his way in Sunday’s polls, Erdoğan, a dictator in all but name, is likely to foment further instability in Syria and throughout the Middle East region.Latest estimates suggest Erdoğan, who is facing stronger than expected opposition, will be forced into a second round run-off in July. Likewise, his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party, in power since 2002 and accused of economic mismanagement and corruption, may lose its overall parliamentary majority.Few observers believe Erdoğan will ultimately be denied the presidential palace. Despite his egregious abuses of civil and human rights, the mass arrests that followed the failed 2016 coup, and his contempt for Turkey’s secular democratic institutions, including independent media, Istanbul’s former mayor remains a potent force.Erdoğan’s personalised politics, underpinned by support from nationalists, observant Sunni Muslims and rural conservatives, and sustained by deliberately isive, populist policies, represent a big challenge for foreign partners.Ahmet Davutoğlu, an amiable professor who was Erdoğan’s chief adviser, foreign minister and prime minister from 2003 to 2016, helped promulgate a “zero problems with neighbours” foreign policy that initially brought positive regional advances. So-called “neo-Ottomanism” was, briefly, all the rage.But as Davutoğlu’s influence faded, Erdoğan – always quick to imagine a slight or find a grievance – reversed course. Relations with Egypt, a key Arab power, are a case in point. Erdoğan’s ambition to be a leader for the entire Muslim world climaxed in September 2011 when he visited Cairo shortly after the Arab spring revolt that toppled Hosni Mubarak. He was feted as a hero.Erdoğan is still bent on creating a new Ottoman sultanate. But his idea is a far cry from the benign construct envisaged by Davutoğlu. On the contrary, it thrives on problems with neighbours. The rift with Cairo endures. And Erdoğan has also fallen out with the Gulf monarchies over continuing links to the Muslim Brotherhood, Ankara’s perceived military ambitions, and its de facto alliances with Iran and Qatar. Prince Salman, the Saudi crown prince, says Turkey is part of a “triangle of evil” that includes Iran and Islamic extremists.As a politician feeding on friction and strife, such isions are grist to Erdoğan’s mill. By creating notional national enemies, he wins votes, or at least he thinks he does. Thus the current election campaign has seen escalating Turkish military operations inside northern Iraq, on the Kandil mountains border with Iran, where the outlawed Kurdish group the PKK is based. Neither Tehran nor Baghdad has given permission for these dangerous armed encroachments – but, in his hubris and arrogance, Erdoğan does not care.According to the Turkish army, dozens of PKK militants were “neutralised” in Iraq and south-east Turkey this week alone. Such random violence is entirely typical of Erdoğan’s crude overall approach to the “Kurdish problem”, which he in any case claims, preposterously, to have solved. Kurdish civilians bear the brunt of his failure. Pro-Kurdish politicians, such as his presidential rival, Selahattin Demirtaş, campaigning from behind bars, end up in jail – or worse.Erdoğan’s Kurdish obsession is exacerbating conflict along the Syria-Turkey border, too. The decision earlier this year to invade Afrin, in north-west Syria, was dictated by his wish to repulse pro-western Syrian Kurdish forces, not to help US and allied fighters combat Islamic State or assist anti-Assad rebels.To avert a military clash between US and Turkish forces around Manbij, the Trump administration shamelessly instructed the Kurds, its only reliable local allies, to surrender a town they had bravely liberated from Islamic State.The pattern repeats around the region. Erdoğan has picked a fight with an old enemy, Greece, in recent weeks, sending aircraft to buzz Greek islands after Athens refused to hand over suspects in the 2016 coup. This confrontational behaviour has brought talk of war – a not wholly improbable outcome, given the escalating dispute over energy exploration rights off still-ided Cyprus.Similarly, past attempts to improve relations with Israel have been abandoned in favour of resumed, politically expedient enmity, justified most recently by Erdoğan’s claim to care about dead Palestinians in Gaza.The overall picture reflects a broader deterioration. This week the US Senate tried to block the big-ticket sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey after members of Congress accused Erdoğan of “actively operating to undermine US interests around the world”. Turkey, they said, “has made a common practice of aggressively targeting US allies while aiding and abetting our adversaries”. That’s an extraordinary way to talk about a Nato ally.Likewise, Erdoğan’s damaging rows with European countries over refugees and future EU membership, his brute defiance of human rights norms and shared democratic standards, and his growing military collaboration with Vladimir Putin, symbolised by the purchase of advanced Russian S-400 missiles, seem certain to get worse if he wins a new five-year term. Turkey’s voters have a duty to the world, not just to themselves. Kick him out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974b97b21dd78a41d27db5ef382faab529cf8df4/2374_27_1218_731/master/1218.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54ccb14c7a7eebc7cfaa55e13c2abed5","title":"mykonos sleeves fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekMykonos Good enough for a Dior capsule collection, good enough for us.Pocket Squares See Gary Hume’s design for the Old Vic’s 200th birthday – the cheapest way to own a Hume.Tasha Tilberg The iconic model is fronting the new Acne campaign, complete with septum ring.Ambroxan The key ingredient in Vuitton’s new men’s scent, L’Immensité will help “invent a thrilling new life”.

No woman in the 105-year history of the Hindi film industry has ever pleasured herself. But this month, in the blockbuster Veere Di Wedding and Netflix’s Lust Stories, no fewer than three women are featured in onanistic embrace.It is one sign of the rapid change under way in India’s most prolific cultural industry. The past decade has seen Bollywood’s first gay kiss, a hit film about sanitary towels and the industry’s highest-ever grossing film – about the lives of two female wrestlers.“It is a great time for Bollywood,” says Swara Bhaskar, one of the stars of Veere Di Wedding, a raucous comedy about four women who reunite for one of their number’s nuptials. “I think the industry is going through fast and interesting change.”Mainstream stars, such as Akshay Kumar, best known for playing pugilistic action heroes, are wading into social issues without fear of alienating their audiences. Earlier this year, Kumar produced and starred in Padman, a film based on the life of an activist who pioneered a low-cost menstrual pad aimed at improving the health of poor women.In its heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, Bollywood seemed to exist separately from the fledgling nation around it. “In the earlier years, we accepted cinema in Bombay as a spectacle, an adventure journey into wonderland,” says Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay, a professor in film studies at Javadpur University. “It was always rich boy meets poor girl, or the other way around, but with Indian elements, such as expressive song or dance.”By 1975, India’s fractious politics had started filtering into Hindi cinema. That year, the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, declared a national state of emergency, ruling by decree, imposing censorship and imprisoning thousands of activists. The biggest films of the year, Deewaar and Sholay, featured morally ambiguous anti-heroes struggling against a corrupt society around them. “These new kinds of heroes allowed us, the ordinary commoner, to feel anger at the injustice in the country,” Mukhopadhyay says.Free-market reforms in 1991 opened India to the world. Incomes rose, and foreign films, television shows and brands flooded in. This gave rise to a new wave of films such as Hero No 1, set in glamorous European locations and featuring characters who switched between Hindi and English, reflecting a generation of middle-class Indians who “were increasingly becoming global citizens”, Mukhopadhyay says.The film critic Anna MM Vetticad credits the national outpouring of anger that followed the 2012 rape and murder of the Delhi student Jyoti Singh for the recent surge in women-centric cinema. “The industry is gradually – too slowly, I say – waking up to the largely untapped market of women with the money to buy tickets and a desire to see films they can relate to.”Yet India remains a conservative country. The masturbation scene in Veere Di Wedding prompted a small but fiery backlash. The Indian censorship board also ordered the purple vibrator Bhaskar’s character uses to be blurred. “We have a culture of silence around female desire and sexuality which is pretty pervasive,” Bhaskar says.The same week the film was released, censors also banned Love, Simon, an American romantic comedy about two teenage boys who fall in love. “The censor board still sees itself as a kind of moral ,” says Alankrita Shrivastava, a Mumbai-based director. She fought the board last year to release her film, Lipstick Under My Burkha, about the experiences, including sexual, of four small-town Indian women. Censors initially banned the film on grounds it was “too lady-oriented” and included “audio pornography”, but the decision was overturned on appeal.“The female point of view is still not so welcome in popular culture,” Shrivastava says. “In the case of my film, I think it was also a class issue. It gave you the point of view of women who are not so economically well off, and that’s still seen as transgressive.”Rising chauvinism across India about religion and caste is also putting pressure on film-makers. Padmaavat, a film about a mythical Rajput queen starring Deepika Padukone, was dogged by rumours it depicted a love scene between the queen and a Muslim conqueror. Angry members of Rajput caste groups rioted in cities and threatened to mutilate Padukone if the film was released.It was finally premiered under heavy security, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2018. But it has made stars such as Kumar wary. “About history, people are very sensitive,” he says. “So it’s better to avoid these things … You have to be careful of people’s sentiments.”Bollywood is the most commercial of India’s film industries and the most averse to risk. But the box office success of films such as Padman and Veere Di Wedding are showing that audiences are “not as prudish as we assumed them to be”, says Bhaskar.The next frontier for Hindi cinema would be an unflinching look at the caste system, she says. “I don’t think that commercial Bollywood has looked at caste in an any kind of depth. We’ve so far only chosen to celebrate caste in very parochial and unthinking ways.”More film-makers could also take their cameras outside cities and tell the stories of the rural and poor communities that make up the majority of the country, adds Mukhopadhyay. “There are still too few films about people who ride the metro, or work in the fish market, or take their tea in a roadside stall,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4d5aaca4a2824566ddad66520a0ad0fef61ea2/18_344_4445_2667/master/4445.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ac23189d9881cb5dd576eedd9ce95a9","title":"england raheem sterling media treatment unbelievable","story":"• ‘Don’t listen to certain tabloids,’ says England forward• Manchester City player was heavily criticised over gun tattooRaheem Sterling has said he is baffled by the constant criticism of his lifestyle by a section of the media which convinces the 23-year-old England and Manchester City forward that “they hate what they don’t even know”.Sterling, who started England’s opening World Cup win against Tunisia on Monday, has received negative media coverage over his allegedly “lavish” spending habits, including when he bought his mother a house in 2016.The former Liverpool forward was most recently criticised for a tattoo of a gun on his leg, which was a symbol to mark the death of his father at a young age but was misconstrued by the media and led to an uproar.“You know, it’s sad that I even have to say this but I’m going to say it anyway,” Sterling wrote in a column for the Players’ Tribune. “There’s a perception in certain parts of the media that I love ‘bling’. I love diamonds. I love to show off. I really don’t understand where that comes from.“Especially when I bought my mum a house, it was unbelievable what some people were writing. I think it’s really sad that people do that. They hate what they don’t even know.”In the lengthy article, Sterling outlines his struggles growing up, including cleaning hotel bathrooms with his mother at the age of six, and the sacrifices his family made to support his dream.“If you grew up the same way I grew up, don’t listen to what certain tabloids want to tell you. They just want to steal your joy. They just want to pull you down.

However, we are going to the game tonight because we want to experience the great atmosphere that comes with the World Cup. I think that the tournament will inspire many women to attend more matches here in Russia,” she said. Another fan, Elena, had travelled from Taganrog in south-west Russia with her family to watch the match. “My children like playing football and I often go and watch. Lots of Russian women really like to play and watch the sport and I think that the World Cup will encourage more women to get involved. International fans help to create a different and more positive atmosphere.”Anna and Elena are two of the many Russian women who will be going to World Cup games in spite of the culture of hooliganism and stereotypes that have led to a predominately male attendance at football matches in Russia. Hooliganism among Russian football fans, previously an internal problem within the country, came to international attention at the European Championship game between England and Russia in Marseille in 2016. However, it has so far been kept at bay during this year’s World Cup. The women’s activist Alena Popova said: “Football continues to be a predominantly men’s sport in Russia. Men with their friends gather in stadiums, before that usually drinking alcohol, and often ending up in fights. This is not the best atmosphere for women.“The World Cup games are calmer than the national championship, so we can see more women in the stadiums than usual. Everyone discusses football here. The problem has not been a question of who is interested in the sport, but about who attends the games.”In recent months the scandal surrounding accusations of sexual harassment made against the MP Leonid Slutsky prompted a wider debate about the treatment and perception of women in Russian society, and activists hope that the World Cup might encourage a more inclusive environment for female fans who want to attend games in host cities.It is not only Russian women who have come out in force to support their national team. Women-only groups have travelled from Europe, Africa and South America, too. Laura, 58, travelled with her friend Luisa, 64, from Uruguay to watch their national team face Russia in Rostov, said: “We use a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with other Uruguayan fans and to meet them for a beer in the evening, but we have been mainly travelling through Russia alone. We have both felt really safe travelling, whether it is on the train or by plane.”Jo, 38, who travelled from Ipswich with her mother, Diane, 68, encouraged other groups of female fans to go to Russia. “Everyone so far has been so helpful and kind,” she said. “It’s really important that groups of women come here as much as groups of lads. We arrived on a chartered flight with England fans and I have to admit it was predominately male, and we should change that.” Samé, 21, had travelled from Tunis with two friends to support the national team during a break from exams: “We have come to support our country,” she said. “We want to wear the flag and to show that women also support football and our national team. Tunisia are not often in the World Cup so we want to come to this match. We have felt very welcome here.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4da2cd03da1ba04fdf139c7e371568714da6fb6/0_78_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c784a882211075ece24489c15d1f5f5","title":"knights of anguish argentinian media react to world cup humbling","story":"The country’s pain after La Albiceleste’s 3-0 loss to Croatia percolated through its newspapers and sports magazines It never looked certain for Argentina. There were always questions left to answer but obscured by the euphoria, anxiety and demands of their country, something felt off. Drawing with Iceland, a moral loss, showed the team’s unease, but pundits pardoned a team that faced a fully parked bus.Croatia would be the real test. The quiet might of their midfield, featuring Real Madrid’s conductor and lead architect, Luka Modric, promised a game of back and forths where Argentina would prosper by taking advantage of gaps. Argentinian media listened to Modric who, outlining his tactics, said Croatia would cut off Javier Mascherano and added one sharp line: “Messi can’t do it all.” Did Sampaoli listen?The pressure of two World Cups sitting in their trophy case, the dreams of 40m Argentinian fans, the spectre of Diego Maradona’s past brilliance and his physical presence in the box seats, proved too much in a 3-0 defeat. La Albiceleste crumbled in a match that featured 33 fouls and seven yellow cards. Maradona cried. If the spirit of Argentinian machismo weeps, it’s fair game for everyone else, and so Argentinian journalists let it pour through their news and analysis immediately after match. Diario Olé quickly led its site with with a pun full of pain: “Knights of Anguish”, a pun on the Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s surname. Inside was a full analysis of the match, prefaced with a paragraph of stark lines, the worst fears of Argentinian hopefuls: “Argentina lost hard … and is at the brink of elimination from the World Cup.” The writer, Diego Macias, continued serving hard truths fans would have declared impossible before the match: “We can play worse than we did against Croatia. We can suffer one of the biggest howlers of World Cup history. We can see the best player have the worst game of his career.”Olé highlighted this line at the end of the graph, in their signature bright green:That is: “They’re the knights of the anguish that pains the soul of so many Argentinians that traveled across the world with the dream of at least fighting for the cup.”Its competitor, El Gráfico, lauded for its 99-year history and cherished tradition and for 139 covers featuring Maradona, but known for not having adjusted well to the digital age, had not updated its site, with Peru’s elimination still leading up to an hour after the final whistle.But Olé could only be outdone by one: the television tabloid channel Crónica TV (watch live at your own risk), notorious for its alarmist red band covers, accompanied by a further alarming trumpet fanfare (lower the volume before clicking on that). In Buenos Aires, at a fan gathering, it brought its microphones, looking to get a rise from the distraught.They dubbed them “the faces of pain”. Not a second had passed before they asked a man: “Who was the last worst on the field?” Mascherano took the wooden spoon.“Is Messi better on the PlayStation than in real life?” the presenter asked another.Only one newspaper was able to keep it together. Immediately after the match, La Nación, Argentina’s leading centre-right daily known for its affinity with the Argentinian military, went with a sober 150-word match report, leaving the “bronca” (anger) of 40m Argentinians out of it and sticking to the facts … the headline: “Argentina embarrassed against Croatia as their World Cup future is in check.”It pointed to Sampaoli’s tactical substitutions “showing no difference” in team play, and to the squad looking “totally confused” towards the end of the match. It only had enough editorialising in it to describe Caballero’s blunder as “gross”. Is that debatable?The article extended the criticism with the obvious irony of the situation, pointing to the fact that while Argentina looked like they had come together as a team, Caballero’s failure “who Sampaoli had highlighted as being good with the ball at his feet – condemned the game”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c52c95e42a25213fa5a0cf2cc7683c859fe357d/0_98_3159_1895/master/3159.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f789ebaa5db6bf67e80124fb2341ae37","title":"world cup fiver england panama","story":"Sign up now!

Switzerland will be on four points if they win. Uh oh! A draw here will keep Costa Rica’s hopes alive, although a win would be better. That’s not asking too much, is it? Even though they trail 9-1 in the head-to-head record and haven’t tasted victory over Brazil since a 3-0 win in Panamerican Championship in 1960. Hmm.

Liverpool fans will continue to wonder why Roberto Firmino is on the bench.Costa Ricaalso also make a solitary change after losing to Serbia. Francisco Calvo makes way for Sunderland legend Bryan Oviedo.All that laughter you can hear is coming from Brazil. There’s nothing quite like schadenfreude in football. There’s nothing quite like seeing your greatest rivals collapse in front of the world, especially when those same rivals took great pleasure in riffing on your misery four years ago. For Brazilians who had to suck it up when Argentinians tipped into them after the 7-1 defeat to Germany in 2014, watching Jorge Sampaoli’s chaotic mess of a side fall to Croatia last night must have been pretty enjoyable.But if Brazil could stop chucking for just a moment - I know, it isn’t easy - they could benefit from absorbing the major lesson of Argentina’s shambles and keep in mind that teams rarely prosper when there is too much reliance on one inidual. For Lionel Messi, read Neymar, who is in danger of becoming a problem for his side, albeit in a different way to his former Barcelona team-mate. When Messi started rubbing his face during the Argentinian anthem, he already wore the fatalistic expression of a man who knew his evening was going to be ruined by Willy Caballero. The players around him simply weren’t good enough - not that Sampaoli’s tactics helped - but Neymar’s genius isn’t compromised by the same dilemma. No, he is the dilemma. Brazil have strength all over the pitch and options off the bench and they believe in their manager, Tite. But while they started impressively in their opening game against Switzerland, taking an early lead thanks to a stunner from Philippe Coutinho, their performance soon descended into self-indulgence and they paid the price when they conceded a soft equaliser in the second half.Neymar was a big part of that. The PSG forward undoubtedly has the talent and confidence to take this World Cup by the scruff of the neck and deliver a sixth title for Brazil. Yet it won’t happen if he makes it his mission to show us how good he is, which is what happened against Switzerland. There were too many times when Neymar slowed the game to walking pace, taking the fizz out of Brazil’s initially sparkling attacks, and there have been reports of Tite telling his star man to pull his finger out. Tite has denied that - but there’s no doubt that he’ll want to see a more cohesive and collective performance against Costa Rica, who slumped to an unimpressive 1-0 defeat to Serbia in their opener. The good news is that Neymar has recovered from an ankle injury - he took a lot of rough treatment from the Swiss, who didn’t take kindly to his piss-taking - and is set to start. Which is just as well. Otherwise we might have seen a return of the “Forca Neymar” baseball cap.

I call my approach Root to Fruit eating. It is a philosophy that aims to make it easier for people to cook good food, blending a little chef’s knowhow with academic research, and making it applicable to home cooks and professionals alike. My shopping list comes in at just over £18 a week – cheaper than the average national weekly spend per person of £24. Over a year, that’s a saving of about £300 while still enjoying top-quality food (I buy everything from my local independent health-food shop or market, or organic items from the supermarket. Of course, if you need to bring the cost of your shopping down further, buy non-organic). I’m a vegetarian, so there is no meat on my shopping list, and eating less meat is certainly a good way of keeping costs down. However, if you are buying meat, opt for cheaper cuts of higher-welfare animals.That margin is there to cover the cost of rent, staff, utilities and, if you’re lucky, a profit. But chefs love good produce, so they devise other ways to keep their costs down, turning scraps that cost pennies into a fine meal for which patrons are happy to pay pounds. Noma, for example – one of the best restaurants in the world – serves cod’s head as a main course. Taking on board a chef’s thrift in the kitchen will help you save money while eating healthily and sustainably – as my guide and recipes show.The best chefs will buy local and seasonal ingredients where possible. Pineapples and pomegranates are luxuries to be enjoyed, but base the bulk of your weekly shop on seasonal produce from the market or through a veg box scheme and you will have a double win, improving the taste and economy. Alongside your basics (eggs, milk, butter, cheese, bread etc) choose a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables including legumes, brassicas and roots. Chefs buy in bulk it’s cheaper in the long run and reduces unnecessary packaging. Store cupboard items are an investment – you can build up a variety over time. Having a few key items in the store cupboard is a great way to ensure there is always an affordable meal in the house. Dried pulses come with a low price tag – even when they are organic – and a little goes a long way. Just 5p’s-worth (60g per person) will provide the bulk of a meal. Other items such as lentils, grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds will give you a variety of delicious ingredients to experiment with making your own dishes.

Mix 75g of wholewheat flour with half a teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of vinegar and 100ml of water. Then fry little pancakes in a pan with the slightest drop of oil and serve with honey, jam or fruit.Porridge with roasted rhubarb, hazelnuts and molasses Porridge is no longer thought of as gruel-like – now it is celebrated and topped with endless combinations of wonderful ingredients.14p 50g oats, flaked buckwheat or spelt11p 1 stick rhubarb21p 15g hazelnuts4p 2 tsp molasses or dark sugarPlace the rhubarb and hazelnuts on a tray in the oven at 190C370Fgas mark 5 for 10 minutes.

Top with the nuts, rhubarb and molasses.Eat like Yotam Ottolenghi and make colourful lunch salads using nutritious grains, seeds, dried fruit and seasonal vegetables. Use up the odds and ends from the fridge and take advantage of those leftovers. My pesto pasta recipe is a great example of how you can make a meal out of store cupboard ingredients and everyday vegetables.Carrot- and beetroot-top pesto pasta Edible greens from root vegetables are delicious ingredients in their own right.

Otherwise, invent your own dish. With fresh vegetables, you can’t go wrong. Roast, saute or simmer vegetables, toss them with herbs or toasted spices and serve them with a grain of your choice. About 50g of rye, barley, spelt or rice (10-16p) is a good portion. Or be inventive and concoct your own soup or stew to use up the withered vegetables hiding at the back of the fridge.Spiced rice, roasted broccoli, carrot and peanut saladI live off salads such as this.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07da2e163a099a97bf0ffa87b932057b7ace5df9/0_800_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79e7c230715849a0adc5c6abb95d2b7e","title":"nile rodgers my family were high functioning addicts i inherited that gene","story":"After a tumultuous childhood, drug addiction and the death of disco, the coolest man in pop is bringing back Chic‘It’s been crazeeee,” Nile Rodgers says of his 65 years on the planet. We have barely met and he is already on to his parents’ heroin addiction, his mother’s three coat-hanger abortions, sexual abuse he witnessed at the convalescent home he was sent to for acute asthma as a child, mingling as a young boy with Eartha Kitt and Thelonious Monk, and life as a Black Panther in his teens. And we haven’t touched on the music – king of disco with his band Chic, supremely gifted songwriter and producer extraordinaire.His voice is rich – part Harvard professor, part meditation guru. There is something so mellow about Rodgers you could smoke him. But when the words sink in, your head spins. It is not just the extremes in his life, it is the frame of reference – Donald Trump casually mentioned alongside non-Euclidean geometry.But back to his mother, Beverly. “My mom fell pregant with me at 13, then after that she didn’t want to have kids so she had three back-alley abortions. They were butchers. Really horrible.” In the end, she had five boys with five different men – all the sons became heroin addicts except for Rodgers (he preferred cocaine and booze). His biological father was also addicted to heroin, as was his stepfather. In his memoir Le Freak, he writes: “Shooting, drinking, snorting and smoking any and everything right in front of me was all part of the daily script.” He describes a family living room dotted with junkies in a state of suspended animation “like a twisted beatnik version of Ingmar Bergman’s chess game with Death”.Aged eight, he saw a man trying to jump from the fourth floor of a New York flophouse. It was his biological father, also called Nile, whom he hadn’t seen for months. Rodgers talked him down. When his stepfather Bobby, who was white and Jewish, almost succumbed to an overdose, everyone panicked. If he had died and the dealer turned out to be black or Puerto Rican, there would have been a serious police investigation. That was when Rodgers learned the world revolved around race.This childhood would have crushed many people. But Rodgers insists it was the making of him. The family home was artistic, bohemian, intellectual. He was treated as an equal (when not having to look after his parents). His mother was smart, gorgeous and like a sister to him (“Everybody else’s mothers looked like grandmothers, but my mom looked like a hottie”), his father was a top percussionist (“The only black person that would routinely play with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra”), his stepfather a gifted mathematician. “They were high-functioning addicts. Always. I inherited that gene.” He grins. “All of them held down jobs. My stepfather was in the schmutter trade. All my brothers worked for my uncle, who had a clothing line on the Lower East Side. That’s why they were able to become heroin addicts because they all had jobs. They were beatniks, they were cool, and they had money to throw around, and they threw it around on heroin.”There was even a family snobbery about heroin. Bobby spent his final days in a Veterans Association home. He was admitted as an alcoholic, but rejected the label. “My stepfather was a rampant alcoholic, but he couldn’t identify as one. They almost didn’t let him in. He said: ‘I am a very proud junkie.’ Hahahaha! I said: ‘Dad, they’re only doing this so you can have a place to sleep.’ He goes: ‘Fuck that, I’m not an alcoholic, I’m a junkie.’”Today, we feel a long way from the Lower East Side of his childhood. We meet at the Serpentine Gallery in London, which is hosting its annual summer party. Shrubs are being pruned into “2018” topiary, champagne flutes lined up and an impromptu dance-floor laid out. Chic will play a private gig for London’s rich and famous – supermodels, actors and the odd politician-turned-newspaper editor. Rodgers is wearing a red velvet jacket, red trousers with more zips than stitches, a silver choker that a pitbull would be proud to own, and a black beret. Few people could get away with it. But Rodgers, recently found to be clear of cancer for the second time, looks wonderful from behind, with his tiny bottom and stick-like legs, he could pass for the teenager who studied classical music at school. Initially, Rodgers thought he would be a percussionist like Nile senior. But the school orchestra needed a flautist. He then moved to the B-flat clarinet, before discovering jazz guitar. Not surprisingly, Rodgers was a precocious youngster. By 13, he was sniffing glue, and by 15 he was sleeping in subways and had contracted gonorrhea. He rarely slept (at the convalescent home, the abuser stalked the dormitory in the dark, and Rodgers learned to sleep between dawn and breakfast – a pattern that stuck). Yet, like his parents, he remained fully functional. He became a session guitarist, touring with the Sesame Street band, before joining the house band at Harlem’s Apollo theatre, backing the likes of Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and Aretha Franklin. At 17, he met bass player Bernard Edwards. Rodgers was a bell-bottomed revolutionary hippy, Edwards a clean-living conservative young man. They became inseparable – and musical life partners.Rodgers also became a member of the Harlem chapter of the Black Panther party. “I was section leader of the Panthers. I moved up in rank rather quickly because I was a martial artist,” he says. What he loved about the Panthers was that new members were given responsibility immediately, to test them. “The day I became a Panther, I had to stand security for Sister Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X’s widow. Very first day!” Was he armed? “No. Just martial arts.”Last year, Rodgers helped out in the aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower in London. He says it reminded him of his Panther days – young people taking the lead, transforming the community. “It was like going back to the streets. To sort out clothes, to feed people, to make sandwiches, to make drinks, to carry stuff, that’s easy. Man, those kids were so damn inspirational.”What was his hope for the US when he was a Panther? “I thought America would become this beautiful utopian place. Of course, it never happened. The closest thing that ever happened to it was disco! Period. End of story.”Rodgers has an astonishing mind, racing between stories. Within seconds, we lurch from the Panthers to the ghettoisation of Los Angeles (where his family moved), the manicured lawns of Compton, and America as a nation built on slavery.What does he think about Kanye West’s suggestion that slavery was a “choice”? He blows a raspberry. “Come on! Slavery a choice?” He gives it more thought. “As a human being, I always used to think there were always more slaves than slave owners. Why were we so afraid of guns? Why didn’t we just take over?” So, he has sympathy with what West said? “No, not at all. Let me take you back to my own childhood. There were a hell of a lot more kids in that room than the one guy who was the abuser. At any point, the 20 or 30 kids could have rebelled. But this person represented an authority figure. He seemed more powerful by himself than all the kids collectively. So, it’s psychological warfare.” Is what West said dangerous? “I can’t really tell. I don’t know how seriously people take entertainers nowadays.”Which brings him to Trump. “The first time I met him, I couldn’t believe what came out of his mouth. I was doing The Merv Griffin Show, and Merv Griffin has to be the nicest person you will ever meet. It was myself, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Trump.” Before the show, Trump boasted to the two of them that he had whupped Griffin in a property deal. “He was talking about Merv Griffin in such a derogatory way, talking about how stupid he was, and we’re going: ‘Do you think we’re going to think, “Oh wow, that guy’s a really smart businessman, he must be the smartest guy in the world.” We’re not thinking that. We’re thinking: ‘If you believe you took advantage of Merv Griffin, you should not be bragging about that because he’s the nicest guy in the world. You should feel like a jerk and should shut the hell up.’”Has he met Trump since? “Go on the internet. You’ll see him taking pictures with me all over the place. He was that kind of guy. He used to take pictures with anybody who was happening in the 70s and 80s, and then he’d call the press ... At the time, I was going out with the crown princess of Yugoslavia so you’d see tonnes of pictures of him behind me.” He pauses. “He’s a builder, but I bet you he doesn’t even understand junior high school geometry. I bet you if I talked to him about Non-Euclidean geometry he’d look at me like: who’s Euclid? Hahahaha!”Rodgers seems to measure out his life in girlfriends. He has been with his current partner, former magazine editor Nancy Hunt, for more than 20 years. Like him, she didn’t want children. Rodgers has said he spent too much of his life looking after his own family, changing his younger brothers’ nappies, to rear his own.It’s time for the soundcheck. As he heads to the stage, Paul McCartney strolls past with his wife, Nancy Shevell. He spots Rodgers. It is obvious he and Shevell are fans. McCartney hugs Rodgers, while Shevell gets out her iPhone to take a photo of them together. “Sorry,” she says. “I wouldn’t normally do this.”Rodgers has changed into an all-black outfit. Later, for the gig, he is all in white – every inch the rock star. Funny thing is, he never was one really. Chic were never about iniduals, they were an ensemble. Rodgers and Edwards were the only permanent members. The rest were hired hands, albeit brilliant hired hands (notably Luther Vandross before his solo success). The groove was propelled by Edwards’ driving, repetitive bass. As for Rodgers, he never bothered with showy solos. He played quietly, rhythmically, cerebrally – more like a technician than a frontman.Rodgers has always considered himself a composer and organiser rather than a star. “I didn’t have to be the best performer, I had to be a terrific composer. Duke Ellington cannot play like Art Tatum, right? But Duke Ellington is the guy who makes the plans, the general Art Tatum is the guy who’s going to get all the medals across his chest. So, I became Duke Ellington. I was the guy who made the plan.”Chic are an extraordinarily tight, funky unit. Their songs are impossible not to move to (Le Freak, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Good Times). Rodgers and Edwards also wrote the classic disco anthems We Are Family and Lost in Music for Sister Sledge. Yet there were so many other influences at play beyond disco – classical, glam rock, jazz, prog rock, soul. They were possibly more influential after their heyday, often sampled by hip-hop artists – most famously Good Times on Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight.No band represented the hedonistic 70s quite like Chic. This was before Aids and punk rock. Life seemed simple for young people – sex, drugs and disco. One image summed up the era: Bianca Jagger on a white horse at Studio 54, where owner Steve Rubell handpicked his guests from the beautiful people queuing outside. After Rodgers and Edwards were turned away from the club, they wrote a song about it that went “Aaaah, Fuck off!” It morphed into “Aaaah, Freak out” on Le Freak, which came out in 1978 and topped the Billboard charts for seven weeks. By the next year, it was all over. On 12 July 1979, at a baseball promotion at Comiskey Park, Chicago, a crate of disco records was blown up on the field between games. Disco was dead – long live punk. Chic’s Good Times reached No 1 a month later, but that was their last US hit, and Rodgers briefly became persona non grata.He soon re-emerged as the producer with the midas touch. There was Diana Ross’s album Diana (her biggest seller), followed by David Bowie’s Let’s Dance (his biggest seller), and Madonna’s Like a Virgin (which sold 21m copies). As usual, at the Serpentine gig, he plays non-Chic hits he has either produced (Let’s Dance) or co-written (Daft Punk’s Get Lucky). He also plays Chic’s new single, the catchy Till the World Falls. It’s a taster for the band’s first new album in 25 years, which will be released in September.You must be excited, I say, coming back after all this time. He gives me a look, and says the band has never been away they were always touring, playing his music, and for him that was the main thing. He reminds me that Chic was never a regular band. Until Edwards died, aged 43, in 1996, Chic was the two of them plus extras, and today it is just Rodgers plus extras. “Chic has always been the best musicians I could find who were available at the time. That may sound cold, but it’s actually very warm – it’s the best muscians I could find. Turn over any Chic album and look at who’s playing on our records, the New York Philharmonic, all the best musicians in the world.”Soundcheck over, Rodgers is in a car heading back to his hotel. I ask if he meant it when he said disco was the closest the US got to utopia. He lights up. “Totally. When I walked into a nightclub with my girlfriend, I was a total jazz snob, and she worked at a jazz club. We were maybe 23, and I heard Donna Summer singing Love to Love You Baby and I heard Eddie Kendricks’ Girl You Need a Change of Mind, and I saw gay people dancing with straight people and black people and white people and Asian people and Latino people, and I saw they were doing this dance called the Hustle and everybody seemed to know how to do it. And me and my girlfriend imitated people doing it and nobody made fun of us. I was like, whoa! Because even at the height of the political 60s and early 70s, no matter how much we tried to say it was about peace and love, people would make fun of you if you didn’t fit in.”When Rodgers was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010, he was told it was aggressive. Is he surprised to still be around? “Extremely. I’m not surprised to be around because of surviving cancer, I’m surprised to be around because the slang on the street was never trust anyone over 35. We lived a live-fast, die-young lifestyle, and that is indicative of the huge amount of people I have lost that were in my world.”Drugs and drink almost did for Rodgers in 1984. “I died eight times in one night and they brought me back. Eight times my heart stopped. I was hanging out with Robert Downey Jr … It was coke and alcohol. I was fine, but then I passed out. Typical rock’n’roll death … you choke on your own vomit.” He says the doctor was filling out his death form when he decided he wasn’t quite done with life. He has been teetotal and drug-free for 24 years.So many of Rodgers’ collaborators have died, often unexpectedly. In April, there was the 28-year-old Swedish DJ Avicii. Rodgers co-wrote his hit single Lay Me Down, and has described Avicii as “the best natural melody writer in my life”. In 2016, Bowie died of cancer. Rodgers has cited their work on Let’s Dance as his most important collaboration because it rescued both their careers. He has called Bowie “the Picasso of rock‘n’roll”, but today he is thinking about him in a different way. “I never met a person who was so the antithesis of a racist,” he says. Is that unusual in the music industry? “Highly.”Is it true the new Chic album features a song dedicated to Prince? He shakes his head. “I took that song off. I had written a song called Prince Said It. Prince and I had been friends for such a long time, and he knew that I started out as a jazz guitar player and that I still only practise playing jazz. He always said to me: put out a jazz album. So, I was going to put out this song that was super jazzy and the chorus was going to have the whole band stop and go ‘Prince said it’ just like his song that went ‘You sexy mother fucker’. Then after Prince passed away, it felt inappropriate. It felt as if I would be captalising on his death. It just felt wrong to me.”As for Edwards, Rodgers calls him “the best musician I have ever seen in my life”. Would they still be playing together if he were alive? “Of course. Bernard died on stage with me.” He stops to clarify. “He passed out on stage and we revived him and he continued playing the show, which surprised the hell out of me. I didn’t even know he had passed out. He died later in his room. If you look at the last interview with Bernard and me, he says there is no one in the world I like playing with more than Nile. He’s my guitar player and I’m his bass player. That always makes me cry.” He repeats it quietly as if to himself. “He’s my guitar player and I’m his bass player.”It would be easy for Rodgers to get melancholy about losing so many friends. But he doesn’t. Instead, he imagines they are still here. “I love how I talk about people in the present tense even though they have been dead for a long time. I still feel I could walk down the street and Bernard is walking with me. I still think about Luther Vandross in the present tense. The other day someone was asking me about music that makes me cry and I said: ‘Every time I go and see Luther and he sings A House Is Not a Home.’ Of course you can’t go and see Luther any more and hear him sing that, but I still think I can.”We are almost at his hotel, and he is thinking about the band he played with as a teenager that opened for the Stooges and Jeff Beck. “They were smokin.” He smiles a lovely boyish smile. “I have never had a bad band. Nobody has ever seen Nile Rodgers in a bad band. EVER.” And the best band he’s played with? He looks at me as if I’m daft. “Chic.” Any particular lineup? “No. Just Chic.

On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his TV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the event was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In the course of a passionate speech, Oprah Winfrey told the audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion, politics and workplace”.Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the scene before him augured the beginning of a revolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s primal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let alone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of person – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or the kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind.Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts it is an unexpected recent addition to the vocabulary of the red-carpet interview it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the #MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are inidual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the term’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable.For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the ideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism.But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it better, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at a party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body.In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a host of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force from the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For it allows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the plight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and the Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction?For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was self-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the poems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible it tries very hard not to draw attention to the means of its endurance.But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who humiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a gender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by a male partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of Angela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so few meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them.The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it describe patterns derived from the structure of the family to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in the way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people.Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would the world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots of pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a zero-sum game.“Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and out of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary Wollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as “the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a theory of social relations.By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the same time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or London. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain women were rapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims have been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels it deeply interested Sigmund Freud and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a distant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and mother goddesses) held power in the world.For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the “chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote.When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was associated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”.It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone of experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own circumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a serious education or the opportunity to earn a living. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the daughters against the fathers”.Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a social structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as men would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the champions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind.In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of little interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light. Oppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine.“Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for this work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of male dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”.The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of the weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same isions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place.“Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a coherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell hooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in society was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must “let go of sexist thoughts and action”.Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the same way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that for African American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women.Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.”The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperinidualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote.A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City “girl power” pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good.Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to arrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of oppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it is because feminism has returned with renewed vigour because inequality has not been eradicated.In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me.Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.”While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.”But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a bellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment.“Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a satisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it, and it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those who fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed.One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can unravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it.But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle iniduals than structures, signs rather than causes.At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to recognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge.

As the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome. But it is not an impossible one. And we are getting ready just in case.“We will use all the tools at our disposal, which could have a cushioning impact. The new long-term budget for our union from 2021 onwards has an in-built flexibility that could allow us to redirect funds if the situation arose.“We will also earmark €120m (£105m) for a new peace programme which has done so much in breaking down barriers between communities in Northern Ireland and the border counties.”Juncker has put Martin Selmayr, the commission president’s former chief of staff, who is now the European commission’s secretary-general, in charge of preparations for a no-deal scenario.Selmayr has drawn up a series of legislative changes that would be needed in the event of the UK crashing out. He has even raised the unlikely prospect of requiring UK citizens to apply for a visa to visit EU member states.A senior UK government source warned that a no-deal outcome would only suit the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we were, God forbid, to get into the situation where you had a sour orce and an acrimonious future relationship, I don’t think that does any good for anybody,” the source said. “That’s a complete lose-lose situation. “The only people who’d have a smile on their faces are people in the Kremlin and elsewhere who wish European democracies ill.”To avoid a border both on the island of Ireland and in the Irish sea, the British government has so far proposed that the UK as a whole effectively stays in the customs union for a limited period after Brexit, until a technological solution to the border issue emerges.It is expected to further propose after next week’s summit of leaders in Brussels that the UK remains in regulatory alignment with the EU on goods, to ensure all border checks are unnecessary.Juncker, however, told the Irish parliament the EU would not allow the UK to use the Irish issue to gain single market access without freedom of movement and membership of the full ecosystem of the bloc’s institutions, including the European court of justice.He said: “Our backstop is a bespoke and workable solution. It is designed for Northern Ireland and upholds its constitutional status.“But this tailored solution for Northern Ireland cannot fit the whole United Kingdom. It covers all necessary customs and regulatory controls to avoid a hard border. And it does not prejudice the future relationship between the UK and the European Union.“With less than 10 months to Brexit, we need more answers and fewer new questions. We will continue – my friend Michel Barnier, myself and others – to take a pragmatic approach to finding solutions. But I also want to be clear: Ireland will come first.“There are those who think that the other 26 countries will abandon Ireland at the last minute for a sectoral deal that suits them. Those people have not understood what being part of our union means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border – and it is our union’s priority.”A senior UK cabinet source claimed the EU’s proposal failed to address the concerns of nationalist and unionist communities. “There have been some serious questions about what we have put on the table but it has not been rejected,” the source said. “What is absolutely essential is that the approach that is agreed is demonstrably balanced and fair to both communities in Northern Ireland. No solution is going to ensure if it is going to be rejected by one community or the other.”Varadkar, at a press conference with Juncker, said he believed there was an “urgent need to intensify efforts” in order to achieve a withdrawal agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8bd3d15228ed51b6bb83228aebd4b0b4fa3f40/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c25b24ca64a77b7681a15ff64a2b01","title":"face of the modern tory party sajid javid tipped for the top","story":"He is a rising star who appeals to left and right, though things can change quickly in his current jobThe contenders: who could replace Theresa May?‘He is the great survivor’: Jeremy Hunt’s ascendancyWhen Sajid Javid was photographed apparently striking a “power pose” outside the Home Office on his first day as home secretary, he set the Conservative party alight with speculation that he was aiming for the top job.The stance, a favourite of Tory heavyweights including Theresa May and George Osborne, had become synonymous with thrusting ambition. Along with his elevation to a senior post, it propelled him to the top of the party leadership rankings.It later transpired he had been tricked by photographers who asked him to take a step forward and captured him mid-adjustment. But it is at such moments that leadership campaigns are conceived. Days later a ConservativeHome poll of party members put him third in the race to succeed the prime minister.Those closest to Javid have tried, with limited degrees of success, to dampen down the rumours. One friend told the : “We know more than anyone from experience that things can change. There is no point in trying to bank that and believe all the hype.“Amber Rudd was supposed to be the great white hope for a lot of people, and look how that ended up. In that department, if you’re not keeping an eye on the job at hand it can all go horribly wrong.”When David Cameron stood down in 2016, Javid launched a joint leadership bid with the then work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, which would have made him chancellor to Crabb’s prime minister. The pair billed themselves as “blue collar” Conservatives, in contrast to rivals such as Boris Johnson, but their campaign had barely begun when they withdrew, and Javid threw his weight behind May.Javid, 48, has a backstory many politicians would give their right arm for. His father, Abdul, arrived from Pakistan in 1961with a £1 note in his pocket and settled in Rochdale, where he worked as a bus conductor. The family moved to Bristol where Javid’s parents eventually opened a shop. A career adviser at Javid’s comprehensive school suggested he become a TV repair man, advice he ignored by applying to study economics and politics at Exeter and then embarking on a successful banking career. He was eventually headhunted by Deustche Bank on a reported salary – which he has never denied – of £3m.His political rise has been swift. Osborne identified him as a potential star and brought him into the Treasury. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2014 as culture secretary and moved to business the following year. May moved him to communities – at the time considered a demotion – where he dealt with the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster.His appointment as home secretary came as a surprise to many as Javid and the prime minister had not always seen eye to eye. But from the off he was his own man, and he appears to have got away with it. In his first statement to the Commons he disowned May’s “hostile environment” policy on immigration, which had led to the Windrush scandal, and in the six weeks that followed he made peace with the Police Federation, lifted the immigration cap for NHS doctors and nurses, and announced a review of medicinal cannabis oil – 24 hours after May had rejected the idea. Whitehall officials say Javid is a pragmatist who is unafraid of telling his boss she is wrong. One said: “He has a great advantage in that he has been a big decision-maker in private life, he is terribly energetic and doesn’t take no for an answer. If there’s a problem he wants to deal with it.” Tory insiders believe a British Asian prime minister – the first – could be a great electoral asset, especially one who believes in free markets. “The left of the party loves him because of who he is the right do too because of his fiscal views,” said one cabinet minister. “He’s the face of the modern Tory party,” one MP added.Javid has always embraced his ersity but does not want it to define him. “I don’t think of myself as an Asian-background politician, I think of myself as a politician,” he has said. Even some Labour politicians offer warm words. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, told the : “Saj hasn’t forgotten his roots or his heritage. It’s a testament to his family and his work ethic that he has broken through the glass ceiling.”In a party deeply ided by Brexit, Javid’s position as a reluctant remainer would just about keep both sides happy. “You don’t have to think we absolutely must be out of the European Union to slightly worry about where this is going,” said one ally.Several cabinet colleagues are impressed. One minister admitted: “I am a fan. He has been nice and punchy. Question is, is he brave enough? I don’t know the answer to that.” But Javid is unlikely to challenge May directly. “He’s very loyal,” one Tory MP said. “He’s not a plotter.”Nickie Aiken, the Tory leader of Westminster council and an old university friend of Javid’s, said: “I certainly think he could go all the way if that’s what he wanted, but at the moment he’s concentrating on the Home Office.”When the inevitable contest does take place, there is likely to be a crowded field of candidates. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has also been tipped for the top. A cabinet minister told the : “Of the two, there is only one that has got what it takes and that’s Sajid. He’s nailing it at the Home Office.”But not everybody is enamoured. A Tory MP said: “Anybody who thinks Sajid is a runner has clearly never heard him speak. He’s wooden, he can’t connect with a crowd.” Some of his early TV and despatch box appearances elicited grimaces from colleagues. At the Home Office he will either sink or swim. A growing number in the party think it will be the latter. After he was appointed, a Twitter meme appeared featuring the 1992 Tory election poster. “What does the Conservative party offer a working-class kid from Brixton? They made him prime minister.” Javid’s picture replaced that of John Major.

But in order to provide services, it is people who must not be held up.”Clark said UK businesses had regularly raised the need for the frictionless movement of staff to continue and he had got the message “loud and clear”. “I completely understand when companies say that they rely on efficient mobility as it currently stands, raising concerns that restricting people’s ability to travel at short notice would be as damaging to our economy as frictions and disruption at our borders,” he told a Liverpool business festival.Clark, a key ally of the prime minister who sits on her Brexit sub-committee, said fresh trade deals with countries outside the EU would not compensate for new barriers to selling services in Europe.“We need to recognise that the EU is by far and away the single biggest consumer of our services exports,” he said. About £90bn of services were exported to the EU in 2016, more than the UK’s next eight largest partners combined.“This extraordinary performance has been built on the back of established trading relationships with the EU,” he said. “As we leave the European Union, we must deliberately set out to maintain these rights and introduce as few new barriers to trade in services as possible. This is every bit as important as avoiding barriers in manufactured goods.”Debate over the UK’s future customs arrangement, and the consequences for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, has dominated proceedings in recent months, with the cabinet disagreeing over two future customs models.Clark sits on a working group examining the “maximum facilitation” model, where technology would be used on the border to minimise the need for customs checks. He is known to favour the alternative option, a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, eliminating the need for some new border checks.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Clark said that for British manufacturers, selling a product such as a Rolls Royce engine was often the beginning of a relationship to provide more profitable services, such as maintenance contracts.He cited the example of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus, which employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in Britain. Its employees made 18,000 trips to France in 2017, with the company operating an internal shuttle between its site at Broughton and those in Bristol and Toulouse, ferrying about 50 employees a day.After Clark’s speech, the chief executive of Airbus confirmed it was considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK as it started to “press the button on crisis actions” over Brexit concerns.The company said it was considering dropping plans to build aircraft wings in British factories because of concerns that EU regulations would no longer apply from March 2019 and uncertainty over customs procedures, instead moving production to North America, China or elsewhere in the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a1adc7518de13f336951a23abcef4fef3486e8/1432_355_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1520d170f775a2a88b0d9e5be1c1f48a","title":"gregor townsend scotland argentina test rugby","story":"• Coach makes eight changes from loss to USA for final tour game• Test is Daniel Hourcade’s last in charge of struggling PumasScotland’s players received a rocket after failing to achieve lift-off in Houston last weekend and their head coach, Gregor Townsend, expects atonement against an Argentina side that has forgotten what victory tastes like.Townsend has made eight changes for Saturday’s match in Resistencia from the side that lost to the USA, seven at forward. He may have left a number of players at home for a tour that started in Canada but the defeat to a side that had never before beaten a tier-one nation was a considerable setback.“I have learned a lot on this tour about this group,” Townsend said. “We have exposed more players to Test rugby and we believe that will put us in a much better position in the future. It will help us for the season ahead and beyond.”The hooker and captain, Stuart McInally, returns from injury while the second-row Tim Swinson is the only survivor at forward with Townsend expecting Argentina to look to dominate up front.However the Pumas have become neither one thing nor the other after sacrificing their traditional 10-man game based on set-piece dominance for a wider approach. Their series defeat to a largely experimental Wales side last week prompted their head coach, Daniel Hourcade, to announce he would resign after the match against Scotland. The decision not to consider players who are based abroad means he has only one team to choose from, the Jaguares, limiting competition for places.Townsend added: “We have to impose our game on them we have not done enough of that on this tour. We need to keep hold of the ball and put Argentina under pressure because when we do we look really dangerous. The breakdown is huge in today’s game and we have to have a greater presence after a tackle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763c2aa36cc7ca764a18d9b4274218f0590bb197/158_0_5518_3312/master/5518.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a90b62e7098bfcda5a8594ae2096b95","title":"royal ascot 2018 day four live","story":"I can pass on some good news about the carriage horses who smashed their way into a clothes shop on Ascot High Street yesterday. Both will recover form their injuries and there is no danger to their lives, according to two grooms I spoke to who were working with other carriage horses here on Friday morning. The grooms did not wish to be named because they work for a rival firm to the one whose carriage was involved in the crash. However, they say that the horses involved are based this week at the same Windsor-area stable as their team and report that both have survived with nothing more serious than cuts and abrasions. The carriages are typically pulled by four horses and none of the four involved in Thursday’s crash are working on Friday only the leading pair were apparently injured, when they collided with a shop window after bolting downhill and across a roundabout. A witness described one of the horses as lying on its side on the pavement while onlookers tried to stem the flow of blood from its side. A horse ambulance arrived soon after and it appears efforts to save the horse have been successful.After three days of pointing backers in the right direction this week this could get tricky. My titfer tipster is plumping for purple but one thing is sure this has been a glum week for layers offering odds on the monarch’s Hat Stakes and apparently green is the colour of choice for backers today.“Last year was one of the best ever but after three days of the public predicting the correct colour of the Queen’s hat, this has resulted in the most expensive for this particular novelty bet on record at Royal Ascot,” said Alexander Kostin of Bonuscodebets. 2.30 Albany Stakes Main Edition 13-23.05 King Edward VII Stakes Delano Roosevelt 3-13.40 Commonwealth Cup Sioux Nation 9-24.20 Coronation Stakes Billesdon Brook 6-15.00 Queen’s Vase Poetic Charm 14-15.35 Duke of Edinburgh Handicap Appeared 11-1Some restraint has taken over here, with four tips at 13-2 or shorter and two of them from the Aidan O’Brien yard which started the week poorly but has since found its stride, much as it did at Royal Ascot last year. Delano Roosevelt, Sioux Nation plus the Guineas winner to repeat in the Coronation counts as a pretty conservative set of tips by my standards, although in this case a lot of people seem to have decided the Guineas winner cannot be trusted to follow up.John Gosden 4 winsAidan O’Brien 3Sir Michael Stoute 2Charlie Appleby 1Willie Mullins 1Marco Botti 1Eve Johnson Houghton 1David Marnane 1John Quinn 1Simon Crisford 1Mark Johnston 1Wesley Ward 1Like his jockey, Gosden will be ruing defeat for First Eleven in the last race yesterday. O’Brien is 1-2 with most firms to be top trainer by the end of racing on Saturday, while Gosden is available at 13-8. In other news, Wesley Ward is a winner at Ascot for the sixth year in a row and the 10th time in all.Frankie Dettori 4 winsRyan Moore 3William Buick 2Andrea Atzeni 2Oisin Murphy 1Charles Bishop 1James Doyle 1Billy Lee 1James McDonald 1Silvestre de Sousa 1Joel Rosario 1Ryan Moore closed the gap with a double yesterday, than Frankie went back in front with Gold Cup victory. But there was a sting in the tail of the Italian’s day, as he was undoubtedly on the best handicapped horse, First Eleven, in the King George V but couldn’t get a clear run and finished only third. “That’s horse racing,” he told me grimly as he returned with the saddle. It is also the reason why he’s on offer at 6-4 with several firms to end the Royal meeting as top jockey, while Moore is odds-on.2.30 Albany Stakes Mark Johnston seems to have a smart juvenile in Main Edition, unbeaten in her two runs so far and an impressive winner at Goodwood three weeks ago after travelling kindly round that tricky course. She’s a half-sister to one Royal Ascot winner, Beachfire, and also to the classy Major Cadeaux, beaten less than a length in the Coventry. Wesley Ward put in a good word for his Stillwater Cove after another of his youngsters won yesterday but his two-year-old winners at Ascot have been over five furlongs and the last 200 yards here might be a stretch for the US raider.3.05 King Edward VII Stakes It’s 14 years since Aidan O’Brien won this race for the one and only time, which is a bit worrying because few trainers would have suitable runners for this race as often as he would. But he’s having a good week with three-year-old colts that weren’t quite up to Classic level, following the wins of Hunting Horn and Kew Gardens, so it could be worth giving another chance to Delano Roosevelt. He stayed on to be sixth in the Derby and may do better around this more conventional track. The unexposed Wells Farhh Go is an interesting alternative.3.40 Commonwealth Cup O’Brien could be in for a big finish to the week, as his Sioux Nation gives him a big chance here, in a race he won last year. A son of Scat Daddy, who has proved such a strong influence for top-class speed, he won the Norfolk at Royal Ascot last year, followed up in a Group One in Ireland and promised better to come with the way he won his warm-up race for this at Naas last month. Equilateral is worth a try at this level, having won a novice contest so easily at Doncaster last month, but his stable has been short of winners lately, for all that a couple of stablemates have gone close here this week.4.20 Coronation Stakes To underestimate a filly once is unfortunate but to do it twice would be reprehensible, particularly in the case of Billesdon Brook, whose Guineas success looks a very solid piece of form indeed. Those that finished in the next six places have advertised the quality of that race again and again and she can show up her doubters by landing the Coronation Stakes on day four at Royal Ascot. The Oaks runner-up and the French Oaks winner were among those she beat fair and square that day. Nor was it the first time she had shown impressive speed on fast ground. She gets her ground again and looks the right bet at 13-2, despite a nagging doubt about the form of her stable.5.35 Duke Of Edinburgh Handicap Beaten only by a very well handicapped rival in this race last year, Appeared is just 2lb higher and will be a big player if in the same form as the rest of Roger Varian’s older horses this year.You could win a £50 bet from Ladbrokes by proving your tipping prowess on today’s races.

We’ll be in touch by email.Please post your tips or racing-related comments below.… The principals offer the classic choice between proven class and potential, as Sioux Nation took the Norfolk Stakes here last year during a busy juvenile campaign while Equilateral arrives with only three starts in novice events to his name. The last of those was an eight-length success, which takes some doing in any company, but he still has plenty to find on paper to trouble Sioux Nation.Victory for Sioux Nation would be a big boost for Ryan Moore in his attempt to finish the meeting as the leading jockey for the eighth time in nine years, and Friday looks a lot like it needs to be “moving day” for Moore, who starts the day one win behind Frankie Dettori. Moore rides the likely favourite in the first three races and the second-favourite in the fourth, while the shortest-priced runner in Dettori’s book of rides is Raa Atoll, a 5-1 chance for the King Edward VII Stakes at 3.05.The fourth day at Royal Ascot was once something of the week’s poor relation, the place where some of the meeting’s less significant events were washed up when the event expanded to five days and there was nowhere else to put them. It has been much revived, though, by the arrival of the Group One Commonwealth Cup three years ago to support the Coronation Stakes, which just goes to show what can be achieved when you are willing to bend the rules just a little.There are roughly 10,000 horse races in Britain each year and only 36 of those have the Group One status, which puts them at the very pinnacle of the pyramid. It is supposed to be earned over a period of years, or even decades, rather than handed out on request. It does seem to help when those doing the requesting have a connection to the Queen, however. The Commonwealth Cup was a Group One from the word go and it has certainly delivered on its promise, swiftly becoming a rival for the Coronation Stakes as the feature event of the afternoon.Last year’s renewal was the best yet, as Caravaggio beat Harry Angel, a subsequent dual Group One winner and the favourite for Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes, and Blue Point, who took the King’s Stand Stakes here on Tuesday.Caravaggio was odds-on to beat 11 opponents 12 months ago, but this year’s Commonwealth Cup provides a very different challenge for the punters, with a full field of 22 runners due to go to post and two horses – Sioux Nation and Equilateral – vying for favouritism at 4-1 (the same price as the market leader for the 28-runner Wokingham Handicap tomorrow) …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f644631e031c3ecb4d639a9ad7e2a08afda651/387_317_3757_2255/master/3757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc2bdaa4024fbae18ae230e8a140473","title":"glastonbury town festival druids pagans travel holidays","story":"What’s Glastonbury like without the bands and the fans? As the festival takes a year off, it turns out there’s still plenty to enjoy, from ethical taxidermy to wall-to-wall druids‘Summer here is something to behold,” says Kevin Mitchell from behind the counter of Knight’s, his chippy on Glastonbury’s Northload Street. “Hippies, druids, goddesses in their finery, people dressed as elves: you never know who – or what – is going to walk through the door.”Knight’s has been run by the same family on the same site since 1909, although the building itself is medieval, constructed from stone taken from Glastonbury Abbey after it was sacked by Henry VIII. If that stone could talk, it would tell of a town much changed from its roots as a place of Christian pilgrimage to its present reality as the new-age capital of England.That transformation doubtless has much to do with the establishment in 1970 of the Glastonbury festival, seven miles to the east of Glastonbury proper. In a typical June, 135,000 music fans will spend the weekend at Michael Eavis’s farm near the village of Pilton. But Glastonbury’s 9,000 full-time inhabitants represent more than 70 faith groups, and the town has forged a resilient identity of its own.“Some people would dearly love Glastonbury to have stayed the old market town of 50 years ago,” says Mitchell, “but we have survived by embracing the multicultural, multi-faith society. So long as they eat fish and chips, I don’t care.”This being one of the so-called “fallow” years in which the festival has a break to allow the land to recover, it seems a good opportunity to focus on the town from which it takes its name. So what is Glastonbury like without Glasto?To find out, I visit on May Day. This is the gleaming hinge of the Glastonbury year, celebrated as Beltane by the town’s many pagans. On this day, the character of the place is the same as always – small-town mundanity rubbing up against exuberant weirdness – but a little more intense. Put it this way: in a Glastonbury cafe you’re never far from someone in a mistletoe crown eating a full English, but on May Day they might add an extra sausage.It’s a full moon, and the early-morning drive over the Somerset Levels reveals a daguerreotype landscape in silver light. I can just make out the dark mass of my destination: Glastonbury Tor, the steep hill topped by a 15th-century tower that stands as a symbol of the town. For each of the last 30 years, 1 May has been marked by a druidic ceremony on the summit.“The druids are always falling out with each other,” I had been warned by Vicki Steward, who writes Normal For Glastonbury, a blog that takes an affectionate view of the town’s Monty Pythonesque qualities. “There are various druid groups including the OBOD (Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids) the BDO (British Druid Order), GOD (Glastonbury Order of Druids) and then there are the Loyal Arthurian Warband. It’s all a bit People’s Front of Judea.”In fact, the occasion is remarkably collegiate: pipers, folk singers, morris dancers, all welcoming the dawn in their own way. The view is so stunning as to be unphotographable even one’s eyes aren’t quite up to the job.Rollo Maughfling, archdruid of Britain, leads the ceremony, calling for peace at all points of the compass, the light climbing little by little to reveal his white robe, red cloak, white beard and, finally, cricket umpire-ish hat. He blows a brass hunting horn in fanfare to the risen sun.By 7am, it is shining golden down the High Street. Glastonbury has few chain stores instead independent shops with colourful fronts give the impression that little has changed since yesteryear, until one looks closer at the displays – healing crystals, wands and cauldrons, incense, tarot cards, and accessories “for the discerning witch”. On Church Lane, an American visitor peers at a pair of stuffed magpies in the window of a shop offering “ethically sourced taxidermy” and declares that it reminds her of the “vegan lapdancing club” back home in Portland, Oregon.Glastonbury is the antithesis of a clone town, which comes with its own challenges. “It’s actually very difficult to buy an ordinary pair of trousers,” says Jamie George, co-owner of Gothic Image, which was, back in 1979, the first “alternative” shop here. “But you can go to the neighbouring village for that.”Outside the Lazy Gecko Cafe, a busker is singing a song from the 13th century: “Summer is icumen in …” A woman with plums in her vowels and flowers in her hair tells a new acquaintance, “Find me on Insta, dah-ling …” There is a strong sense of the centuries swirling together. There is something in the air, and not the obvious. Though Glastonbury seems to run on mead and weed, its hedonism feels rooted in something authentically numinous.One can sense this quality at the abbey. It has that mingled sadness and peace often found in ruined churches. A white dove flies through Romanesque arches, and nothing now remains of the high altar but a stone border within which irreverent dandelions refuse to bow their heads. Yet what still stands is grand and beautiful. “For a thousand years Glastonbury was the most spectacular abbey in Christendom,” says Jon Cousins, the town’s former mayor. “It was so important that in Italy they called it Roma Secunda, the Second Rome. God knows why Geoffrey Chaucer wrote about that other place.”Like many who visit and settle in Glastonbury, Cousins felt “called” there. You hear this a lot: that the town and landscape has some sort of siren presence. To help this sort of visitor, the tourist information office features a “pilgrim reception centre”, which directs “spiritual seekers” to whatever they might need, be it a Christian shrine or a Wiccan ritual. “Someone might stagger in here and say they’ve just seen Archangel Michael on the Tor,” says the centre’s founder, Morgana West. “Glastonbury has an effect on people. But we are non-judgmental.”Back out on Magdalene Street, the 376 bus to Bristol is being held up by a maypole in the road. “Blessings be for public transport,” calls a man with a green face and top hat, soothingly, to the driver. This is the Beltane procession through town.There are hundreds following, among them the Reverend Diana Greenfield, AKA “the goth vicar”, whose dog collar peeps over an elaborate mantle of leather and fur. This servant of the Church of England is strolling companionably alongside Tracy, a woman in full paganish fig – an antlered headdress wound around with ivy. Tracy is walking Oakley, a wirehaired vizsla the Rev has her own pet, Cara the collie, on a lead. It’s a very Glastonbury, very British scene, the bonds of dog ownership being more important than differences in faith.We all climb the hill to Bushy Coombe, a green field overlooking the town. There, amid drumming and ululation, the maypole is erected. Green ribbons shimmer as people dance around. Some wag mentions the Wicker Man, of course, but that’s not quite right. Today feels more like a celebration of the community and its twin values: open mind and open heart.At around 3pm, as the last ribbon tightens around the pole, the sun disappears behind a bank of cloud and a gentle drizzle begins to fall. The ritual, it appears, has worked – dull and damp, the English summer truly is icumen in.Where to stayThe Sheppey Inn is a well-regarded pub and restaurant with three en-suite rooms (£100-£120 a night) and two nearby cottages (£130 and £140 a night). Out in the wilds of the Somerset Levels, four miles from Glastonbury, it offers welcome perspective on the town. The bar, decorated with vintage toys and stuffed animals, carries an enticing selection of cocktails and local scrumpy. “We’ve tried to create a place that is true to where it is,” says owner Mark Hey, “so it feels like a giant cider barn full of weirdness.”Where to eat and drinkHundred Monkeys is an organic cafe and bakery that does a mean veggie breakfast. The Rainbows End was Glastonbury’s first vegetarian cafe over the decades it has managed to perfect the vegan chocolate brownie. The George and Pilgrims’ is about as old as English inns get, slaking thirsts when the abbey was still a going concern, and should satisfy connoisseurs of low beams, nooks and crannies. Alternatively, the King Arthur has the town’s biggest beer garden, a sun trap full of dogs, kids and dudes with dreadlocks.What to seeGlastonbury has two natural springs. The Chalice Well (£4.40 adults, £2.20 children) is associated with the legend that this is where Joseph of Arimathea buried or washed the Holy Grail, the cup used at the last supper, and therefore that the waters (which visitors can drink they taste of iron) represent the blood of Christ. The nearby White Spring, free to enter, is a former Victorian pump-house. Repurposed as a temple, its candle-lit vaults echo with running water. A sign on the door forbids cameras and phones, warns visitors about the presence of “faerie portals”, and signals that naked bathing is acceptable.• Accommodation was provided by the Sheppey Inn"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man.

Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ce545015217589d3028eba9e8cd9e02d2ea92e7/155_326_3092_1856/master/3092.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=269543a513838f2d5d8af008f894438b","title":"friday news quiz worlds best female chef and a presidential rebuke","story":"How well do you know this week’s news?

But on Friday and Saturday night, hundreds of singers, dancers, acrobats and horsemen will fill the vast concrete expanse of Budapest’s Heroes’ Square for performances of Trianon: the rock opera.The treaty of Trianon sliced up Hungary in the aftermath of the first world war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It still features heavily in Hungarians’ historical imagination 98 years later, and the so-called “Trianon trauma” is one of the building blocks for the nationalism of Viktor Orbán’s government.“Trianon – the word and the subject matter – has been stirring passions in our country for a hundred years,” Gábor Koltay, the rock opera’s director and a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, said at a recent press conference. “We will show how the events of 1920 – the dismemberment of the country – impacted our lives.”Orbán, who recently won a third consecutive term as prime minister, has cannily taken advantage of the sense of historical victimhood and loss among many Hungarians. It has helped him deliver a hard-right agenda, which this week saw parliament pass the so-called Stop Soros law that criminalises any inidual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant.At Trianon, Hungary was deprived of more than half of its pre-war territory and population. Many of these people were not ethnic Hungarians, but the treaty left more than 3 million Hungarians outside the borders of the new Hungary.“Around 2 million of these Hungarians were living right on the borders, in majority-Hungarian areas, so any fair treaty based on self-determination would have included them,” said András Mink, a historian.When Orbán’s government came to power in 2010, one of its first acts was to establish a “day of national unity” on 4 June, the anniversary of the signing of the Trianon treaty. Orbán quickly made ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states eligible for Hungarian citizenship. These new citizens – in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine – have voted overwhelmingly for Orbán’s Fidesz party, giving it an electoral boost.Orbán has painted himself as the man who has led Hungary on a path back to recovering from some of the mental and moral losses at Trianon, if not the territorial ones. “Since Trianon we have never been so close to bringing our nation back to self-confidence and vitality as we are now,” Orbán said in a speech last year. “And if Hungary has a government that will serve foreign, globalist interests then Hungarians will lose this historic opportunity, and not just for one electoral cycle but for decades to come.” Few Hungarians believe that a redrawing of borders to regain lost land is possible or even desirable, although the opinion is still occasionally aired in pro-government media. More often, government figures have called for “moral reparations” and used the painful memory of Trianon as a rallying call for modern-day nationalism, and even to back up Orbán’s virulent anti-migration philosophy.In a letter to locals asking them to vote against EU migration quotas in a 2016 referendum organised by Orbán’s government, István Vitányi, a Fidesz MP, wrote: “At Trianon we lost the majority of our country and we cannot lose the rest of it. So vote no!” Orbán’s critics say history teaching is one of many areas where the government is attempting to exercise increasing control. “There used to be a relatively free textbook market now there’s basically a monopoly,” said László Miklósi, chairman of Hungary’s Independent Association of History Teachers.He said textbooks now offered a simplistic take on the “Trianon dictate” and Hungary’s victimhood. “Nobody sensible can doubt that what happened to Hungary in 1920 was unfair however, it’s better if students can form their own opinions from looking at the sources.” The approach also stretched to more recent history, Miklósi said. Two years ago the association fought a court battle to have a government-funded history textbook withdrawn that painted Orbán as a national hero and asked students to write an essay in support of an anti-migration speech by the PM. The classroom is not the only place where the lessons of history appear tailored to an official narrative that portrays Hungary purely as a victim. A 2014 monument to the Nazi occupation in a central Budapest square has been criticised for whitewashing the role of Hungarians in the Holocaust. It depicts Hungary as the archangel Gabriel under attack from the German imperial eagle. Locals have created a rival, makeshift memorial on the pavement by the monument, dedicated to “historical truth”.Mária Schmidt, an Orbán loyalist, runs the Terror House, a central Budapest museum that chronicles the horrors wrought on Hungary by both the Nazis and the Soviets. Her latest book, heavily advertised inside the museum, is a collection of rants against the alleged Islamisation of Europe and “self-assured and arrogant” migrants who are enacting a long-held plan of eastern peoples to occupy Europe.A magazine controlled by Schmidt recently ran a list of 200 “mercenaries” supposedly paid by the Hungarian-American financier George Soros to destroy Hungary – an eyebrow-raising gambit from someone who runs a museum dedicated to the memory of victims of repressive regimes that drew up similar enemy lists.Orbán’s critics say the prime minister has exploited Hungary’s difficult history to push his nationalist messages, but they also acknowledge that the trials of the 20th century, and particularly the dismemberment at Trianon, provide fertile ground for doing so. “When you want to track down the roots of anti-western and anti-liberal sentiment in Hungary, you should go back to that moment in history, when for many the lesson was that the ideas of liberty and self-determination are valid only for the western powers,” said Mink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7298a1799c1d3cf5fde57c940dad1837ac13db/0_0_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09f28e768ac61c406fbf0409a1b32656","title":"mobile phones french school ban","story":"How pupils at La Gautrais rediscovered games, dance and the art of conversationIt’s breaktime at a middle school in rural Brittany, and huddles of teenagers are chatting in the playground. Two 15-year-olds sit reading novels, while others kick footballs or play chase. One boy does some press-ups.The hum of conversation and flurry of movement contrasts with most other French secondary schools, where playgrounds can be eerily silent as pupils stare at their mobile phones. In La Gautrais, no one looks at Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube. Here mobile phones have been banned. Few seem to miss them. “I do have a phone, but I leave it at home and don’t really think about it much,” shrugged one 14-year-old girl in a denim jacket. “I don’t rush to check it after school. When I get home, first I’ll have a snack, I’ll chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if I’m waiting for an important message.”Two of her friends don’t have mobile phones at all. “We don’t really need phones because we’re always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time – too much probably – and we’re really good friends,” one said.La Gautrais middle school in the village of Plouasne banned the use of mobile phone on its grounds four years ago, long before the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an election promise to outlaw children’s phones in schools in an attempt to “detox” teenagers increasingly addicted to screens. News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theLa Gautrais’s 290 pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 come from surrounding villages in this farming area. Since the ban, staff have noticed more social interaction between children, more empathy and a readiness to learn at the start of lessons. There is less “switching-off anger” at having to move from breaktime gaming on smartphones to focusing in class. “No phone use at school gives pupils a moment’s peace from social networks and some children tell us they appreciate that,” said the headteacher, Yves Koziel. “On social networks there’s an acceleration and extreme simplification of group relationships which can create conflict, even bullying. We’re freeing them from that – at least during the day. We’re cutting the umbilical cord and offering some respite from it.”Koziel said he was pleased to see children returning to “ordinary things”, such as chatting, games and breaktime clubs and activities including dance and knitting. “I think children are more available for social interaction when they’re obliged to really speak to each other,” he said.Policing the ban has not been difficult. Pupils switch off phones and leave them in schoolbags and there are fewer than 10 confiscations a year.“At my previous schools, sometimes phones were in pencil cases and pupils were checking them or writing messages on phones on their laps,” Laura Floch, an English teacher, said. “Here, phones aren’t an issue.”In March, Floch took a group of 15-year-old pupils to London for a five-day trip, visiting sights including the British Museum and the Museum of London. The teenagers were not allowed to use their phones during the day or during excursions, except when asking to take photographs of sights, but they could use them in evening free time.She said: “They knew it was fair and they accepted it. But I could see other groups of children from France on similar trips at the same museums just sitting on benches and staring at their phones during the whole museum visit instead of taking part.” Sitting with his friends at breaktime, Anatole Desriac, who recently got his first mobile phone at the age of 15, said he approved of the ban. “When I’m with my friends I prefer a proper conversation,” he said. “If you’re all standing around with phones, you talk about what’s on the screen rather than really listening to each other.”He and his friends use their phones to listen to French rap on the long bus journey. At home, playing Fortnite on PlayStation was just as enticing as a phone, but all their parents limited screen use. “Knowing how to use phones in moderation is just part of life for us,” Christian-Steven Kitoko, 16, said. Desriac’s mother, Nicole Lefeuvre, a librarian, said: “Children and parents tend to agree that it’s a good thing not using phones at school. Parents of teenagers find it hard enough to be constantly negotiating screen time at home.” Her rules include no phones before the age of 15, no phones in bedrooms, no screens at all on Thursdays and school-holiday reading time for novels, comics or magazines. In the playground, many under-14s said their biggest worry was breaking their phones, smashing them or dropping them in water so they were happy to leave them at home for safety’s sake. One 16-year-old girl said she did not mind keeping her phone switched off on though she felt attached to it. “I have to know it’s there and I keep it in my jacket pocket, touching it regularly. I feel a bit lost without it.”In Bourges in central France, Jean-Claude Chevalier, the headteacher at Littré middle school, which has 600 pupils, introduced a ban on phone use at breaktimes this year because of what the playground had become. “Staff were surprised to see hundreds of children simultaneously glued to their phones during break – all sitting down staring at a screen and not talking,” he said. “It brought a loss of empathy, because children can use much stronger language on a screen than they would use face to face.” None of the fears about banning phones had materialised. “We thought there might be more playground violence and rowdiness but that wasn’t the case. Pupils talk more, the playground is livelier,” Chevalier said. “We thought we’d have to confiscate dozens of phones a day, in fact the number of confiscations has gone down. We thought the toilets would be monopolised by children sneaking a look at their phones, but that hasn’t happened at all.“What we have seen is that pupils seem less addicted to phones.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

File photograph: PAThe State Examinations Commission is hiring iniduals without any teaching qualifications to correct students’ Junior and Leaving Cert papers due to a shortage of qualified staff.The development has sparked concerns over the standard of correcting and accusations that the integrity of the State exams is at risk.The commission has insisted, however, that any non-teachers who have been hired have third-level qualifications in the subject area they are marking.Teachers say the rate of pay for correcting exam papers – which ranges between €5 and €32 per exam – is the main reason why there are difficulties sourcing qualified staff. A recent teachers’ union conference heard the pay rates described as “blood money” given the hefty tax rates teachers face outside their core pay. The commission’s website states that “all suitably qualified teachers are welcome to apply for these positions” and that applicants must have “recent teaching experience in the relevant subject area or related subject”.However, it has confirmed to The  that while examiners are primarily recruited from a pool of experienced teachers, there are instances where non-teachers may be recruited as long as they have a third-level qualification in the relevant subject.It said this takes place only if vacancies remained after “all suitable and fully qualified applicants have been offered appointment”.A spokesman said it was not easy to identify how many non-teachers were due to be hired this year until the recruitment process was fully concluded.“We are satisfied that all examiners are appropriately qualified in the relevant subject area and that priority is given to teaching experience in making decisions on appointment,” he said.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman, Thomas Byrne, said the shortage of teachers was putting correcting standards for exams at risk.“Last-minute cramming might be expected of some students, but last-minute recruitment of correctors with no teaching qualification is not acceptable. “We need to know in what subjects this is happening and to what extent. Students have a right to ensure their scripts are marked to the highest possible standard.”The commission has struggled to fill examiner positions for a range of subjects until recent days.It is still seeking examiners to mark Junior Cert religious education exams, and is filling vacancies “as they arise” in Junior Cert geography and French.In using non-teachers, the commission said all examiners received detailed training and instruction in order to fulfil their role. The commission said it had an absolute responsibility to exam candidates to ensure their work was marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity and had a range of measures in place to assure quality in the examinations which included measures to identify poor practice."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Highs of 26 and 27 degrees are forecast for Tuesday and WednesdayCongregation had denied claims proposed sale would adversely affect 520 pupil schoolWHO move criticised as making hobby seem abornmal lack of scientific evidence into gamingFormer taoiseach rejects calls for Border poll \u0026ndash says only negotiation will lead to united IrelandMinister for Education opens consultation process for four areas including Galway and DroghedaAfter move to new post civil servant\u0026rsquos official title will be director general of Global IrelandPractice of CervicalCheck sending smear tests abroad has been criticisedJean-Claude Juncker assures Varadkar State is priority in Brexit talksRate of pay for correcting exam papers cited as main reason for rolling staff shortagesQuestions will relate to experiences of inappropriate behaviour and bullyingChristopher Kerr (32) is serving life for the murder of schoolboy Michael McIlveen (15)\u0026lsquoAfter many years, I felt my hand, as if a hollow shell got filled with life again\u0026rsquoSandra Higgins (37) from Cavan is accused of causing serious harm to a babyT\u0026aacutenaiste stresses white-collar crime must be dealt with robustlyCommunity group says it is disappointed hospice not seeking alternative locationFile of 800-pages on \u0026euro1.6bn disposal of NI loans understood to have come from developerReporters win awards for court reporting and coverage of legal issuesDr Amal Al Qubaisi \u0026lsquoa figure of great historical significance\u0026rsquo, Dr Martin McAleese saysFindings likely to lead to changes in the way such conditions are treated"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3539509.1529614053!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit republic not alone but backed by europe","story":"President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said that Ireland has to be part of an Brexit deal.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach  Leo Varadkar and President of the European Council Jean-Claude Juncker:  “Ireland has to be part of the deal.” Photograph: Tom McLoughlinEPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar received reassurances from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker that Irish issues will not be left until the end of talks on the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. Mr Varadkar was told by Mr Juncker during a meeting in Dublin on Thursday that matters relating to Ireland, such as the future of the Border, would not be left until last-minute talks on Brexit are held in October.He told the Taoiseach privately that Ireland would not be left isolated – a point he later reinforced publicly. The meeting came as the timetable for dealing with issues such as the Border “backstop” – which prevents a hard Border even if Britain and the EU fail to reach a deal – has slipped in recent weeks. The Government had initially insisted that sufficient progress needed to be made on the issue before next week’s European Council summit, but now accepts that an agreement will not be reached until October. Mr Varadkar said it was “abundantly clear” the backstop must be in place for there to be a withdrawal agreement between the EU and Britain and a transition period from when Britain leaves the bloc in March.“The withdrawal agreement must include a legally binding backstop so that there cannot be a hard border on the island of Ireland in the future, whatever circumstances may prevail,” he said. Reflecting his assurances to Mr Varadkar, Mr Juncker told a press conference that Brexit issues affecting Ireland were not “a bilateral question between Ireland and the United Kingdom” but rather “an issue between the UK and the European Union”.“We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone. We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission – this will not change,” he said. “I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland. Ireland has to be part of the deal.”The potential for Ireland to be left exposed as an outstanding issue at the end of negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was discussed in a number of internal meetings among senior Government figures in recent days.Mr Varadkar told a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on the EU, which deals with Brexit issues, that the Government was not planning for a hard border.The Government is insisting it will still not make any preparations for a hard border, even as Mr Juncker warned the Dáil that provision must be made for a “no deal” Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Addressing a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad , the former prime minister of Luxembourg said that “as the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal”.“This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome, but it is not an impossible one and we are getting ready just in case,” he said. Mr Juncker said it was in everybody’s interest for the UK and the EU to stay as close as possible and to be friends, partners and allies. “The reality is there is no arrangement outside the European Union which is as good as membership,” he added. He said a pragmatic approach would be taken to finding solutions. “But I also want to be clear, Ireland will come first.” Mr Juncker said those who thought the other 26 countries would abandon Ireland for a deal that suited them did not understand what being part of the union was. To applause, he said Ireland’s Border was the union’s priority. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the greatest challenge Ireland faced was to “solve the riddle of Brexit”. He said the Government was “deeply grateful for the remarkable solidarity and support we have received from the EU institutions and fellow member states, none more so than from president Juncker”.Mr Varadkar also paid tribute to the “diligence and understanding shown by the commission’s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier”, who travelled to Dublin with Mr Juncker.The Taoiseach, referring to the particular challenges faced by Ireland with Brexit, said “the backstop for the Irish Border, agreed in December, must be legally operative in the withdrawal agreement to apply ‘unless and until’ an alternative solution is agreed”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said “there is a considerable and growing unease about the failure to move from generalities to concrete and final agreements in the negotiations”. “The simple fact today is that London may actually never come up with a credible proposal,” he warned. “We are extremely concerned with how negotiations on the Irish text have now been linked with the overall withdrawal treaty text and its provisions for final status negotiations.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said British prime minister Theresa May had “set out a policy of Ireland last, if at all”.She said, “We are most disappointed that, despite an assurance that the Irish question would be answered in advance of setting out the details of the new relationship that Britain wishes to foster with the EU, this has not happened.”Ms McDonald said “in the absence of the British demonstrating how they would avoid a hard border, uphold the Good Friday Agreement and protect citizens’ rights, it is reckless to allow talks to progress to the next phase”.She appealed to Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier “not to make this mistake”.Ms McDonald said :“I hope the EU does not blink and fulfils this mission” of “Ireland first and Ireland now”.Mr Juncker intervened in response to People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, who asked if Ireland could trust him “with our Border or the interests of the people in this country”.Mr Boyd Barrett said “We do not trust the Tories. Can we trust you?”.The commission president replied “Yes.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons - are threatened with extinction today due to human activities, but no ape species were thought to have become extinct as a result of historic hunting or habitat loss,” note scientists at the Zoological Society of London, who led the research.“However, the discovery of the recently extinct Junzi changes this, and highlights the vulnerability of gibbons in particular.”The skull of the extinct Junzi gibbonThe Junzi are believed to have completely died out less than 300 years ago and could be one of a number of now-extinct gibbon species that once inhabited central China.Lead author Dr Samuel Turvey said the discovery suggests we are currently “underestimating the impact of humans on primate ersity”.“These findings reveal the importance of using historical archives such as the archaeological record to inform our understanding of conservation and stress the need for greater international collaboration to protect surviving populations of gibbons in the wild,” he added.A cranial reconstruction of the Junzi gibbon The partial cranium and lower jawbone of the ape were found in the burial chamber believed to belong to Lady Xia, the grandmother of China’s first emperor, Qin Shihuang, who ordered the building of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army sculptures.First excavated in 2004, the tomb contained 12 burial pits that contained animal remains, including leopards, lynx and black bears.Archaeologist Hu Songmei, of the Shaanxi institute, told Science that imperial Chinese burial chambers were commonly arranged in this manner so that the departed could “continue to enjoy the life they knew” in the afterlife.The Junzi gibbon was discovered in an ancient Chinese imperial tomb Gibbons were also regarded as high-status pets and considered to be wise and noble animals during the period of Emperor Qin’s rule up until 210 BC.Today, gibbons are the most endangered of all the ape species due to a loss of their forest habitat, the illegal wildlife trade, the use of their body parts in Chinese medicines and poaching, according to the WWF.The Hainan gibbon, found on Hainan Island in southern China, is considered to be the world\u0027s rarest mammal, with only 26 still in existence.

I was also wrong to have used false captions that misled my followers and those who viewed my images,” he wrote.“Having marketed myself as a photographer, I fell far short of what was expected of me and disappointed those who believed – or wanted to believe – in me. For all of that, I apologise.”Mr Yow had described himself as a #SonyCreativeAlly in several posts and the Japanese multinational had promoted his work on its own website. Sony told Mothership that it was “surprised and disappointed” by the reports and was looking into the matter. “Sony strongly encourages the art of creativity, however we do not condone any action such as plagiarism and take a serious stance on it,” the firm said. Uniqlo told the Straits Times that it had engaged Mr Yow for a one-off travel campaign a year ago and that he conducted an in-store talk about his travels.Several Instagram shots appear to have been removed since the deception was uncovered, and despite Mr Yow’s contrite apology, many fans have been less than forgiving. “Try offering online photoshop classes as a comeback. You may be even more successful than what you were before,” said one.  “Congrats on your infamy!” said another.   Please review our commenting policyTrue \u0026#39intense\u0026#39 face of Belgium\u0026#39s Mystic Lamb revealed after 600 yearsItaly heading for new showdown in the Mediterranean after NGO ship rescues 220 migrantsGrizzly bear statue must be removed from roadside because it causes crashes, Welsh government tells town Construction workers rescued after a lorry crash left them dangling under a bridge in the USFive anti-trafficking campaigners abducted and gang raped in India Mystery extinct ape discovered in ancient Chinese imperial tomb Charing Cross station evacuated as armed police detain \u0026#39man on the tracks claiming to have a bomb\u0026#39The British-educated Islamist trying to siphon votes from Erdogan in Turkey\u0026#39s electionTen-year-olds and teachers face drug tests as Duterte takes war on drugs into schools in the PhilippinesJames Comey: \u0026#39I\u0026#39d rate Donald Trump a one out of ten as president\u0026#39Designer Kate Spade\u0026#39s \u0026#39heartbroken\u0026#39 father dies on the eve of her funeralSophie Gradon dies at 32: Love Island pays tribute to former contestantComment: How I learned to love New York\u0026#39s tipping culture Sheila Atim interview: ‘You can’t say Shakespeare has nothing to offer because he’s a white man’ Quarter of Japanese workers confess they want to kill their bossGreece crisis declared \u0026#39over\u0026#39 after eight years as eurozone agrees debt reliefEU slaps retaliatory tariffs on US as trade war rattles marketsFour million EU nationals will get right to stay in the UK after Brexit - and violent criminals could be among themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/22/TELEMMGLPICT000166864453_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpyqAwmoo14ISLBandNx16ENu8irlkpope0xqzbBxa5I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"true intense face belgiums mystic lamb revealed 600 years","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThis picture shows a close-up of the restored original of the \u0026#39Adoration of the Mystic Lamb\u0026#39 altarpiece by the Van Eyck brothersThe intense and soulful true face of Belgium’s Mystic Lamb, the central figure of a world-famous 15th century Flemish altarpiece, has finally been revealed after almost six centuries.The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, one of the world’s most stolen artworks and oldest oil paintings, was created in 1432 by Jan Van Eyck and his brother Hubert, leading artists of the influential Flemish Primitives. The giant altarpiece, which features hinged panels depicting Bible scenes and daily life, is on display in St Bavo’s Cathedral in Ghent.It was revealed this week after a painstaking restoration that tourists visiting the cathedral over the last 600 years have been gazing at a completely different lamb’s face to the original, which was overpainted in the 16th century to become an “impassive rather neutral figure”.The head is very different from what we\u0027ve known since the 16th century. It depicts a lamb which is much more intense and expressive, which connects far more directly with the people, with big eyes, restoration project leader Helene Dubois said.Restorers at the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage unveiled the painting, saying overpainting meant it had not been true to the original for centuriesKoenraad Jonckheere, professor of Baroque art at Ghent University told Flanders Today that the overpainting, “subtly adapted the shapes to the taste of the time and to some extent neutralised the Van Eycks’ intense and humanised identification of the Lamb into an expressionless animal, seemingly unaffected by what was about to come.”The original, by contrast, has more personality and sports “an intense gaze and is characterised by a graphically defined snout and large, frontal eyes, drawing onlookers into the ultimate sacrifice scene”.It was not the only time that the 20 panel altarpiece, of which 40 percent was overpainted, has suffered an indignity.  A partial restoration in 1951 revealed the lamb’s original ears but techniques were not advanced enough to complete the work, leaving the lamb sporting four ears for nearly 70 years.The altarpiece has a colourful history, and was commandeered by both Napoleon and the NazisOver the years the 15 foot by 10 feet masterwork has been split into pieces, seized by Napoleon and the Nazis and stolen by thieves. In a mystery that has baffled detectives for decades, one of its 12 panels is still missing after a daring heist in 1934.10 reasons why Belgium is not as boring as you thinkA week ago, Ghent’s public prosecutor urged people not to dig up the city’s beautiful cobbled squares after the author of a new book suggested the panel may be buried underneath one of them.The full restoration of both sides of its hinged panels is due to be complete by the end of 2019, in time for the start of a year of celebrations of Jan Van Eyck.  Please review our commenting policyItaly heading for new showdown in the Mediterranean after NGO ship rescues 220 migrantsGrizzly bear statue must be removed from roadside because it causes crashes, Welsh government tells town Construction workers rescued after a lorry crash left them dangling under a bridge in the USFive anti-trafficking campaigners abducted and gang raped in India Mystery extinct ape discovered in ancient Chinese imperial tomb Charing Cross station evacuated as armed police detain \u0026#39man on the tracks claiming to have a bomb\u0026#39The British-educated Islamist trying to siphon votes from Erdogan in Turkey\u0026#39s electionTen-year-olds and teachers face drug tests as Duterte takes war on drugs into schools in the PhilippinesJames Comey: \u0026#39I\u0026#39d rate Donald Trump a one out of ten as president\u0026#39Singapore Instagram star apologises for deception after posting stock library imagesDesigner Kate Spade\u0026#39s \u0026#39heartbroken\u0026#39 father dies on the eve of her funeralSophie Gradon dies at 32: Love Island pays tribute to former contestantComment: How I learned to love New York\u0026#39s tipping culture Sheila Atim interview: ‘You can’t say Shakespeare has nothing to offer because he’s a white man’ Quarter of Japanese workers confess they want to kill their bossGreece crisis declared \u0026#39over\u0026#39 after eight years as eurozone agrees debt reliefEU slaps retaliatory tariffs on US as trade war rattles marketsFour million EU nationals will get right to stay in the UK after Brexit - and violent criminals could be among themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/16/trans-religion-2.jpg","title":"trans rights christianity envangelicals lgbt religion prayer","story":"Created with Sketch.For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame\u0026nbspLGBT+\u0026nbsppeopleClick to followThe Independent OnlineEvangelicals assumed I was broken because of my gender identityOn Sunday afternoon I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown Washington, sipping coffee under a sliver of roof on a wet day, minding my own business, when three people who were clearly tourists walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The result will be a tailor-made system based on the inidual.“This is a unique example of great British innovation and we are leading the world in developing this kind of person-centred system. Countries like New Zealand, Spain, France and Canada have met with us to see universal credit to watch and learn what is happening for the next generation of benefit system.”Referring to the NAO report, Ms McVey said it did not take into account the government’s recent changes to universal credit.“Our analysis shows that universal credit is working,” she said. “We already know it helps more people into work and stay in work than the legacy system.“Once fully rolled out it will be a single streamlined system, reducing administration costs and provide value for money for all our citizens.”But Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the NAO report into the government’s flagship welfare system was “damning” and described universal credit\u0026nbspas a “major failing of public policy”.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesRevellers watch the sunrise as they celebrate the pagan festival of Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The latest agreement comes as Washington looks to press ahead with further talks with Pyongyang about the status of their nuclear weapons programme.Both sides agreed at a round of talks on their heavily fortified border to hold a series of basketball matches in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on 3 July\u0026nbspto 6 July.“The South and the North will continue to form unified teams for other international sporting events... while holding joint training to strengthen inter-Korea cooperation and exchanges,” a statement put out by the countries said.Meanwhile, the Korean athletes at the 2018 Asian Games will march together at the opening and closing ceremonies under a unified flag, as they did at the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\u0026nbsp“Today\u0027s meeting was to follow up on the achievement we made during the recent Olympics by boosting more regular, various sports exchanges including friendly matches, joint participation in global events and joint training,” said Lee Hae-don, a South Korean official who participated in the talks at the border\u0026nbspvillage of Panmunjom.World news in picturesIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi participates in a mass yoga session along with other practitioners to mark International Yoga Day at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) in Dehradun.A woman and child are told they will have to wait before crossing the US border as confusion sets in following the Trump administration\u0027s zero tolerance policy on immigrationPeople wave a banner with a picture of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a gathering of supporters of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Istanbul, Turkey,.

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

My job is to represent my country, Ireland, and to do that as part of the European Union and we remain at the heart of the European Union.The most important aspect of the withdrawal agreement for us is the backstop, and Prime Minister May committed in March that there would be a backstop and outlined in December what that backstop would contain."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Emily-Thornberry-978103.jpg","title":"emily thornberry world cup finals bank holiday england flag","story":"Emily Thornberry thought the tournament was held every five yearsThe Shadow Foreign Secretary suggested the country should be given the next day off whenever \u0026ndash if ever - England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland play in the final match of the tournament.Her declaration, made during a speech at a press gallery lunch, came as she still tries to brush off condemnation for ridiculing patriotic English for flying the St George\u0026rsquos flag.In 2014 Ms Thornberry quit Labour\u0026rsquos front bench after a tweet which appeared to ridicule a white van driver, who had draped England flags on the front of his house, months after that year\u0026rsquos World Cup tournament.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island.

Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa.

It is hoped it will be ready in just a few months, so they can have years to prepare everyone for our EU exit.They will have to pay £65 in order to register and stay here - which is cheaper than the price of a British passport.He told a Lords committee today that minister want to make it as simple as possible and might not involve any paperwork having to be sent in to them.Mr Javid said. You have an app, you can put your passport next to your phone, and it will download your information.Then you can take a selfie - Im sure youve done that many times - you download it too, and match the information downloaded with the chip and confirm it electronically.Other details like National Insurance numbers would be taken through the app and cross referenced with existing information.But he also had to admit that there was an issue at the moment with whether it would work on iPhones, because of problems with Apples technology.However, ministers are working on the issue with Apple, and hope to get it resolved in time for the apps launch in the autumn.Mr Javid said he wanted trials to start in July with a full roll out following a few months later.And for those less tech savvy EU citizens, Mr Javid said they would be setting up shop in libraries and local council buildings to help register people in person too.Theresa May has already agreed that the millions of EU nationals living in the UK can remain for life – if they apply for settled status.Ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd in April said the residency application system would be “as easy” as setting up an online account at luxury brand LK Bennett.Yesterday Sajid Javid said he would be looking for reasons “to grant, not refuse” a right to remain.The scheme offers more “generous” rights than first planned- and better terms to those awarded to British nationals with foreign partners.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said answers will be checked and decisions given “very quickly”. There would have to be “a very good reason” for refusal.But critics accused ministers of giving in too much to the EU.Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch think tank said: “The government seem to have conceded almost every point demanded by the EU.“Meanwhile there is very little evidence that EU member states have done anything to speak of for British residents in their countries.”A row over criminal checks threatened to block the entire withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU last year.

I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.”Producers have not yet explained how Barr’s character will be written out of the show.However, The Hollywood Reporter cited sources that claimed Barr will retain all rights to her Roseanne Conner character – plus any future spin-offs beyond The Conners or any future reboots of the original.In a joint statement, Goodman, Metcalf, Gilbert, Goranson and Fishman said: “We have received a tremendous amount of support from fans of our show, and its clear that these characters not only have a place in our hearts, but in the hearts and homes of our audience.“We all came back last season because we wanted to tell stories about the challenges facing a working-class family today.We are so happy to have the opportunity to return with the cast and crew to continue to share those stories through love and laughter.”The stars recently signed new one-year contracts for the spin-off that will keep them at the same salaries, believed to be around $300,000 (£230,000) an episode, according to Deadline.Announcing the spin-off, ABC said: “The Conners stories demonstrate that families can always find common ground through conversation, laughter and love.The spin-off will continue to portray contemporary issues that are as relevant today as they were 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412984488.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mystery victorian ghost watching boy bike solved","story":"Mum Louise Lenton, 41, noticed the figure as she looked back over the clip recorded on a visit to Oldway Mansion in Paignton, Devon - but it turns out it was a security guard not a ghost.It shows her five-year-old son circling the car park on his cycle.In a window on the first floor a figure can be seen which Louise thought might have been the ghost of a Victorian woman.Louise, from Paignton, Devon, said: It looks like a lady with hair in a bun, with white cuffs around her hands.Torbay Council told her that security guards would have been inside the building at the time the footage was recorded.But Louise insisted: Its certainly not a security guard from what I can tell.

I was just filming him and that was it.It wasnt until I was home and in bed watching the film back when I noticed it.I was like, Oh my gosh and my partner could not explain it.

Shes a remarkable woman. Were moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy.The dad-of-two heard everything as wife Nicola was tragically stabbed to death by a schizophrenic home invader as she protected their kids Stanley, six, and Isabella, three.Mr Cross, an IT specialist, was working away from home at the time and 200 miles away in Hull when, during a phone call with Nicola, he heard her desperate fight for life.He appeared on the latest series of Channel 4s SAS: Who Dares Wins, in which ex-Special Forces soldiers put recruits through a gruelling recreation of the SAS selection process.The 40-year-old had ex-Special Forces hardmen Jason Fox and Ant Middleton in tearful silence as he revealed the harrowing details of that night.Marcin Porczynski, then 27 and a schizophrenic, broke into the familys home late at night intending to kidnap their two young children while Mr Cross was working in Hull.Reliving the night of his wifes death, he said today: Nikki just called me late in the evening and said she was worried about somebody outside the house and the police had been earlier.The children were in bed at the time, Stanley was six and Isabella was three. So we were discussing options on the phone, what to do. But before she could do anything, the guy broke in through the back doors and killed her.I heard it all down the phone. Its complete shock, you dont know whats going on. I felt utterly heartless. I was on the phone to the police on the other line, trying to relay information.I didnt know what had happened to the children till I heard them crying on the phone and then I thought they were OK.Mr Cross said after the killing he and his two kids moved in with his parents but he returned to his former home occasionally so he could let out his emotions in private.He underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flash backs within the first month after Nicola died.I felt like I couldnt breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if Im going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure theyre confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.In January this year Mr Cross revealed he was doing really well and had found love again with 27-year-old Alex.Discussing his new relationship he said: She came in and sort of let everything wash over her. Its a brave decision to get involved with a family thats had something like that happen to them.Shes been perfect with the children. [In her job] she specialises in under fives but she can do things with the kids, techniques and things, that I dont know anything about.Its been amazing, quite freaky really, to have someone come in whos so perfect.Porczynski pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court in December 2016 to Nikkis manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and had been hearing voices for up to two years before the killing.Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun or call us direct on 02077824220.We pay for videos too.

Mr Johnson had described the Treasury as the heart of Remain and said dealing with the Chancellor’s department was part of an inner struggle. The Foreign Secretary also hit out at the folly of allowing rows over the Irish border to hold up the Brexit process. But tonight Mr Hammond took a swipe at Mr Johnson in his Mansion House speech to the City in London. He said: As we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decade, that maintains low friction borders and open markets. That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027. Rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it.  He also set out the Government\u0027s blueprint for maintaining London\u0027s position as a global capital of finance after Brexit through opening up access to markets beyond the EU. Mr Hammond spelled out how the Government will seek a series of new global financial partnerships to open up cross-border financial services. At the same time he reiterated his appeal to Brussels to come to the table to discuss a future relationship on financial services, something the EU side has so far refused. The Chancellor also emphasised that financial services will remain a foundation of the UK\u0027s economic success outside the EU, which will in turn require continued openness to the global economy. He said: Global Britain is not just a strategy for Britain\u0027s economic future, it\u0027s a statement about what kind of people we are and about the economy and the society we want to be. Connectivity was always at the heart of London\u0027s success. And to succeed in the future, we must remain connected to the world, including the important emerging markets. So while some question the benefits of openness, being open to the world, and being a global capital of finance, will continue to be the foundation of the UK\u0027s economic success.

Last Friday, it emerged the 1872 landmark had been sold to tycoon Sheikh Abid Gulzar for the knockdown fairground stall price of \u0026pound50,000. This is despite the fact that as recently as 2012, the pier was saved for the community by amazing local campaigners and a \u0026pound12million lottery grant. Another local group, Friends of Hastings Pier, had a new not-for-profit plan waiting in the wings, and were on the verge of reaching \u0026pound50,000 with a crowdfunder. But the administrators preferred Mr Gulzar – who has banned dog walkers, cyclists, fishing and picnics at nearby Eastbourne Pier, and threatened to introduce an entrance fee.  And the cash-strapped, austerity-hit council were powerless to help. This is heartbreaking for Hastings, but the pier is just one of an estimated 4,000 public spaces being sold off every year in every austerity-squeezed town in the country, according to a new report. The Great British Sell Off, produced by charity Locality – who dug out figures via FOI requests – says 20,651 public assets were sold off in the last five years alone. Locality chief Tony Armstrong points out that “4,000 buildings is more than four times the number of Starbucks in the UK”. Many are being lost to private developers for the highest price and will never be used by the community again. Some, like Hornsey Town Hall in London, are being made into flats while others, like the former Grade II listed Ealing Town Hall in West London and the landmark Liverpool Municipal Buildings, will become luxury hotels. In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years.  For the last 18 months, I’ve been retracing George Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier through the industrial North and Midlands – and this great sell-off of our public spaces has been evident in every town in the country. Wigan Pier was basically a music hall joke about a coal jetty in landlocked Wigan, but across the country we’ve found evidence of the local authority fire sale. Privatised piers and boarded-up or flogged-off libraries, swimming pools, working men’s clubs, lidos, town halls, museums, youth centres have all been sold to the highest bidder. As councils have been squeezed by the Government and forced to choose between adult social care or keeping a museum open, they’ve felt forced to choose human care. But the result is all the places where we used to come together from our different walks of life have been shuttered up and closed off. The Government recently recognised we have a crisis of loneliness and yet what’s lonelier than having nowhere to go? We have a crisis of social cohesion, but nowhere we might bump into each other. Young people are being drawn into gangs by hanging out on street corners, but what about the places they used to go to? We have a crisis of working class people not going to into arts or sport, and yet the free places in which they used to access those things are derelict. Even estate pubs and local football clubs are being forced to close.

Almost half of voters (48%) back having a public vote on the deal the UK strikes with Brussels. That compares to just 25% who said there should not be a public vote. Another 18% had no strong views either way and 9% did not know. Pollsters Survation questioned 1,022 UK adults ahead of the second anniversary tomorrow of the vote to leave the EU.  People were asked: To what extent would you support or oppose holding a referendum asking the public if they will accept or reject the deal?  PM Theresa May has firmly ruled out any second referendum, and Jeremy Corbyn has not committed to one despite some Labour MPs wanting him to.  But the poll claims those supporting a new referendum included more than a third (35%) of Leave voters, alongside 66% of those who back Remain.  The poll, for ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, also suggested there\u0027s been a slight change of heart over Brexit overall. Britain would vote 53% to remain and 47% to leave if there was a re-run of the 2016 referendum, the poll claimed. That would effectively reverse the 2016 result where Leave won 52-48.  But the country is still deeply divided  The survey found that 43% back a soft Brexit while 37% favour a hard Brexit. Some 39% of those questioned said Brexit will be bad for the economy, but another 35% said it will be good for the economy.  Almost half (47%) thought a no deal Brexit will be bad for Britain, but almost a third (32%) still say it would be good for Britain. And 40% believe there will be a Brexit dividend for the NHS compared to 37% of people who think there won\u0027t.  Millions of people still don\u0027t understand key issues around the Brexit vote  Just 17% of those taking part could identify the correct definition of the customs union. And just 38% chose the correct description of the single market. Nearly two-fifths (39%) said they had a \u0027limited\u0027 understanding of the issues around the Irish border. A further fifth (19%) said that they didn\u0027t know anything about or hadn\u0027t heard of the issue.

Save The Children said unfair Universal Credit has led to people turning down work out of fear they will be pushed into childcare debt. Under the six-in-one benefit, parents wait up to five weeks as standard for their first payment. But the way the nursery industry works means they have to pay childcare costs, including deposits and fees, up-front first. The Commons Treasury Committee has branded this a fundamental design flaw that should be rectified as a matter of urgency. Now Save The Children has compiled data that suggests parents are being charged \u0026pound1,000 each - despite half of low-income families having no savings.  The charity\u0027s campaigns director Steven McIntosh said: Parents are trapped between going into debt to afford childcare and turning down work because they can’t risk household direct debits bouncing. This defeats the point of Universal Credit. “Childcare support should help parents find work and improve children’s chances in life. Instead of making it harder to get into work, the Government must switch to providing upfront help with childcare costs.” The charity estimated the average cost for a month of 40-hour-a-week childcare is now \u0026pound1,000 for a child aged one (or \u0026pound680 for 25 hours a week). The cost of 40 hours\u0027 childcare ranges hugely across the regions, from \u0026pound856 in the North West to \u0026pound1,423 in London, Save The Children said.  These costs risks tipping working families over the financial precipice, the charity warned. A quarter of lowest income families already face problem debt. A third owe more than the value of their assets. Working parents of three- and four-year-olds, plus some two-year-olds, are eligible for 30 hours a week of free childcare from the government.

Lucia Ghahramani has strenuously denied that her husband-to-be Jack Troutt, 23, cheated on her while he was on a lads\u0027 holiday to Ibiza. The 31-year-old bride-to-be branded the woman who made the allegation, Steph Kendall, an attention seeker and has confirmed that her wedding to Jack is still on. “I don’t believe the girl. I know Jack and this girl is just attention seeking, she told The Sun. “The wedding is absolutely still on. I was angry, but more at her. Steph says she overheard Troutt bragging to mates that he slept with a woman the previous night and wrote a Facebook post about the conversation.  The post read: If this is your boyfriend Jack staying at the Azuline Bergantin hotel Ibiza him and his friends have been proudly discussing that he cheated on you last night Hun. Troutt says she simply misheard a conversation between his pals about previous relationships while sat around the pool.   The post was taken down by Steph 24 hours after it was published but had already been widely-shared on social media, including by Love Island star Kady McDermott who tweeted it to her 357,000 followers.  Jack, from Essex, has said he now fears for the future of his relationship due to the unwanted attention caused by the post.  It\u0027s devastating because I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I haven\u0027t had any sexual relations with a woman on this holiday. I haven\u0027t kissed another woman or even kissed another woman on the cheek on this holiday. It\u0027s literally bizarre.  When he confronted Steph in the hotel to explain she had misheard him, he claims she walked away from him - and the post remained being shared on Facebook .   I tried to confront her and at the same time she just kept walking away from me. I said listen, you\u0027ve got to get this post down, it\u0027s not true. She just walked away. I called her up through Facebook and she just said \u0027okay hun, bye\u0027. I\u0027ve got friends and family all contacting me asking me if I\u0027m alright because of the amount of abuse I\u0027m receiving from people all over the country. Jack is bravely speaking out and calling for tougher regulations on social media users accusing people of things that \u0027ruin their lives with no concrete evidence\u0027. I am sure I am not the first person this has happened to and I know I won\u0027t be the last. I think there should be some sort of law or regulation put in place to say how you can make an allegation like that without having anything set in stone.

Clare Clifford, who says she is now teetotal, was unable to attend the inquest into her daughter\u0027s death today as she was caring for her six-week-old son Jack.  The digital marketing manager from Leeds, West Yorkshire, who insists she did not roll onto her daughter in bed, also has another daughter - Layla aged six. Speaking after the inquest into the death of seven-month-old Charlotte, she said: It\u0027s healing having a new baby but it also brings back a lot of bittersweet memories. I have to try and be logical and think that what happened with Charlotte was tragic - obviously I\u0027m nervous when Jack is asleep. The nights are hard for me because I\u0027m worrying about it happening again.  Clare said she and her husband James were trying to look to the future. She said: We are trying to move forward and trying to put our lives together again and trying to not let the nerves of what happened with Charlotte take away the joy of Jack being a baby. Clare said he knows she didn’t roll onto her daughter Charlotte but the inquest could not rule out the possibility that she did. Evidence from a pathologist found the infant was placed in an unsafe sleeping situation with an intoxicated mother on the night she died. But revealing her devastation earlier this year, light sleeper Clare insisted she just wouldn\u0027t have rolled onto her daughter.  She said: I’m always going to be wondering if I didn’t have her in bed that night - I’ll wonder that for the rest of my life.” She added: “In my heart of hearts I know I didn’t roll onto Charlotte. I just wouldn’t. I’m such a light sleeper and she was a very vocal baby.” The inquest into Charlotte\u0027s death heard how Clare had got into bed with the infant at midnight after drinking with her husband James. The couple had been drinking in their home, the hearing was told, with the mum saying she was in control of herself at all times. She awoke in bed with her baby at 4am on June 18 last year. Charlotte was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary, West Yorkshire, after she was found not breathing, but doctors were unable to save her.  She was pronounced dead 45 minutes later. According to evidence from pathologist Michael Parsons read out to the court, there was no specific post-mortem finding confirming death as a result of overlaying. However, the doctor also stated in a report that death caused by overlaying remained a possibility that could not be excluded. In written evidence read out by coroner Jonathan Leach to Wakefield Coroner\u0027s Court, Clare told how she described herself as merry on June 17, 2017. The evidence read On a scale of one-ten I would describe myself as a five. I am used to drinking alcohol and am used to drinking moderately - I was in control of myself at all times. Clare also wrote how she had been advised of the risk of co-sleeping, but she had never been told not to do it.

Instead, the Department for Health has set up a helpline and is waiting for relatives to “come forward”. It means they may never learn the shocking truth of how their loved ones’ lives ended early “without medical justification”. Families of other victims said it was “outrageous” and called on the NHS to find as many relatives as possible. Out of 456 victims identified by the Gosport Independent Panel, just 163 families have been in touch with investigators.  It leaves 293 victims whose identities are known after the panel uncovered their medical records. Another 200 victims “probably” died in the same way but their medical notes cannot be found. Victims included Arthur Cunningham, 79, who died in 1998, five days after being admitted with bed sores and frail Elsie Devine, 88, who died after being pinned down by four nurses and injected with a large, inappropriate dose of opioids. Gillian Wilson, 73, whose husband Robert died at Gosport War Memorial, said: “It’s terrible so many people haven’t been spoken to and haven’t been involved in the inquiry.

Little Riley-Jay, two, and his sister Layla-Rae, 11 months, have cystic fibrosis and require round-the-clock care from their mother. Mum Chelsea Leigh Carter, 22, from Middlesborough, and her partner Dale are both carriers of the gene which causes the condition.  Chelsea told Teesside Live : “No mother should outlive a child.”  Cystic fibrosis causes a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs.  Every morning, Riley-Jay and Layla-Rae receive a concoction of antibiotics and vitamins, which keep them alive, alongside physiotherapy twice a day. The youngsters have not had an easy start to life. Riley-Jay uses a nebuliser to help him breathe, while Layla-Rae is on medication for her iron levels. The pair also have to take capsules with every meal and snack - if it contains fat - and travel to the RVI Children’s Hospital every six to eight weeks for regular checkups. Chelsea said: “Their illnesses just keep going round in a circle.

Chelsea said: “They deserve nothing but the best. I hate the fact they are going to need medication and physiotherapy for the rest of their life.

The dad of two, who listened helplessly as wife Nicola was attacked by a schizophrenic home intruder, will wed mental health clinician Alex Wells next year after dating for 15 months.  He said: I\u0027m engaged to Alex. She\u0027s a remarkable woman. We\u0027re moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy, he told BBC Three Counties Radio .  Nikki, 37, was brutally killed in September 2015 as she tried to protect her two children Stanley, six, and Isabella, three, from 25-year-old Marcin Porczynski who had broken into their home in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.  Dan, 40, was at work 200 miles away in Hull when he heard Nicola\u0027s screams down the phone as she pleaded for her life before she was stabbed 10 times. Porczynski later pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to Nikki\u0027s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.   You can listen to Dan\u0027s full interview on BBC Three Counties Radio here.    Speaking about finding love with Alex, 27, while dealing with the heartache of losing Nicola, Dan revealed that he has his late wife\u0027s blessing explaining: We had that chat. We had discussed what would happen if one of us died young. Nikki said \u0027I want you to be happy. I want you to find someone else, someone that can look after the kids\u0027. I was the clown and would say \u0027If I die young, I want you to wear black for the rest of your life and never meet anyone else\u0027. We had the conversation so every day from the day Nikki died decision making was always based around what would Nikki do, what would Nikki want and we still do that today.  Nikki wanted me to be happy. She wanted the children to be happy. She was that type of person and that gives me confidence knowing I\u0027m doing the right thing. I honestly believed for a long time that I would never meet anybody else and then gradually things changed and I began to realise that I didn\u0027t want to be on my own for the rest of my life and I knew what Nikki wanted for me.

Brave Dan, who following Nicola\u0027s death set up the charity Nikki\u0027s Wishes to help children who have suffered from bereavement in his late wife\u0027s memory, says they will never forget her. Dan added: There will always be that sadness that Nikki is not around. We\u0027ll always miss her. We\u0027ll always love her. We\u0027ll always remember her. We have to keep moving forward as well as holding onto that nice bit of the past. We do, obviously, have our daily issues that we need to address around the event of what happened to Nikki and that will continue, but in general we are a positive family and we\u0027ll keep being so.     Dan first revealed he had found love again back in January when he appeared on This Morning. He said: A year ago this weekend I met Alex, she\u0027s fitted beautifully into our lives. It\u0027s a brave decision to get involved with a family like this, she\u0027s a mental health clinician and she can do things with the kids. She does memory boxes where you use your hands and other techniques to bring back memories. It\u0027s been amazing, quite freaky really to have someone come in who\u0027s so perfect.      Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Dan explained how counselling has helped him and his children to deal with the trauma.  He said: Stanley was six and Isabella was three at the time, I was telling her to leave and go to my mum and dad\u0027s but before she could leave he broke through the back doors and killed her. I didn\u0027t know what happened to the children until I heard them crying on the phone, and knew they were okay. Dan and his children moved in with his parents after the horrific night, but he returns to his former home sometimes so he can let out his emotions in private and feel closer to Nikki.  Dan underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flashbacks within the first month after Nicola died. I felt like I couldn\u0027t breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if I\u0027m going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure they\u0027re confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.

Katie Smith, 18, from Oldham, Manchester, dropped to just 6st 7lbs after losing a shocking 4st 7lbs, and was so skinny that she wore children\u0027s size 10-11 clothes. Then aged 15, Katie restricted her food to just 100 calories a day, consumed 40 laxatives and jogged on the spot for hours. But, in November 2017, after being admitted for inpatient treatment, she recovered and now weighs 10st 2lbs and is a size 10.  Katie, a student at North Chadderton Sixth Form College, says: I realised that if I carried on, I would die. It really made me want to get better. Having an eating disorder was awful, I never thought I\u0027d make my 18th birthday. Growing up, Katie was a competitive swimmer and was always a healthy weight. I was never bigger than a size 10 but my frame was muscly and I weighed around 11st, she said. It was never anything that I worried about though.  But in February 2014, then aged 14, Katie developed bulimia. I would binge eat up to 5,000 calories before purging it up, she said. It became a cycle but, all the extra calories made me gain weight. In December 2015, Katie was trying on a size 12 bridesmaid\u0027s dress for the wedding of her sister, Joanne, 34, a teacher, when her eating patterns spiralled out of control. Katie said she felt horrendous.  The fabric clung to my figure and I hated how I looked, she said. After that, I developed anorexia. I exercised excessively every day, jogging on the spot for hours and performing 500 sit-ups. I only allowed myself to eat 100 calories of vegetables daily and I took 40 laxatives. Some days I\u0027d eat nothing and I weighed myself constantly. I was determined to fit into the dress and look skinny at the wedding. I wanted to look good for the pictures.  Unsurprisingly, Katie\u0027s weight plummeted and within six months, her 5ft 5in frame weighed just 6st 7lbs. She added: I could fit into size 10-11 children\u0027s clothes, but I purposefully wore baggy clothes to hide how bony my frame was. I even stopped swimming when I was 14 so mum would never realise how skinny I\u0027d gotten. My muscles ached constantly and I always felt cold. I had to wear multiple layers of clothes and my periods completely stopped. Handfuls of hair would fall out while I was in the shower and I\u0027d be left with clumps of hair on my pillow. It was terrifying. In February 2016, Katie attended her sister\u0027s wedding in Ireland and by this point she\u0027d already lost 2st 7lbs leaving her a size 6 and 8st 7lbs.  I was really looking forward to the wedding but on the day, I felt awful, she said. I didn\u0027t manage any of the wedding food. I felt huge even though now I realise I wasn\u0027t. My dress was a size 8 and hung off me. I pretended to family members that I\u0027d eaten and played with the food on my plate. In March 2016 Katie was diagnosed with anorexia by her psychiatrist and she was admitted as an inpatient at the Hope Unit, Bury, Greater Manchester, where she underwent therapy for three months. A month later, she reached her lowest weight of 6st 7lbs. In June 2016, she was discharged as an outpatient but she relapsed over the summer.  Katie said: I felt self-conscious about my weight and how I looked, especially when my friends were wearing bikinis. I started restricting food again. It got completely out of control. For the next 17 months until November 2017, Katie was in and out of hospital battling her eating disorder. It was tough I missed a year of college to concentrate on getting better, she said. Then one day, I realised that I didn\u0027t want to die I knew that if I carried on, I wouldn\u0027t make it. I upped my calorie intake and stopped exercising. I realised my health was more important.

The hospital in Stanley, capital of the Falklands , was unable to perform it, reports the Manchester Evening New s.  So doctors contacted Wrightington Hospital – which specialises in orthopaedic surgery – and arranged for Shaun to have his surgery in England.  The teenager flew from the Falkland Islands to Chile, followed by a transfer in Brazil that took him to Heathrow, before a final car journey to Wigan. He had the operation at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary and was cared for on the Rainbow Ward. Shaun’s dad Justin, who was born in the UK, said he wasn’t even sure where Wigan was and had to Google it. He said: “When the doctors said we were going to Wigan I had to have a bit of a Google, because, even though I was born in the UK, I have lived on the Falkland Islands for 30 years, so I didn’t know exactly where it was – I just knew it was up north.” Puneet Monga, an orthopaedic consultant who specialises in sports injuries and shoulder surgery at the orthopaedic centre of excellence at Wrightington Hospital, carried out the surgery.

The average for this time of year is about 21C (70F) in London, 18C (64F) in Manchester and 17C (62F) in Scotland. We\u0027re going to be widely four or five degrees above that tomorrow and the next day, Mr Bowles said on Friday. The forecaster said parts of the UK are likely to reach 30C on Wednesday.

Kirsty Sharman made headlines worldwide after she left the note for paramedics while they were treating her sick neighbour in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The message read: I couldn\u0027t give a s*** if the whole street collapsed. Now move your van from outside my house. Now Staffordshire Police have worked with the council and the property owner to make sure the 26-year-old\u0027s former Tunstall home will be rented out to a different tenant. It comes as a three-month closure order - which has seen the property boarded up since March - comes to an end this week, the Stoke Sentinel reports.  Magistrates granted the closure order after Sharman subjected her neighbours to 18 months of \u0027hell\u0027. Those living nearby are now celebrating after being told Sharman cannot move back into the property. Dennis Viggars has revealed some residents even wanted to hold a street party after Sharman was kicked out. The Tunstall North Residents\u0027 Association chairman said: “When she was here you just couldn’t sit down and settle. “We got her out in the right way. We could have done it the wrong way and got in trouble ourselves but we persevered with phoning the police and in the end one person in the police thought ‘what on earth is going on here, let\u0027s sort it out’.  It took over 18 months to get rid of her but we did it in the right way. We didn’t hound her out, she hounded herself out. He alleged: “She was OK when she first moved in and we had no visions of her being a problem. But within two months it was chaos.” Dennis described the day of the closure order as a ‘great day’. He said: “We had to calm the kids down and one or two people and tell them to let the police and council get on with it. They wanted a street party when she went. “The ambulance incident started it all off again. It went viral all over the world. We had a friend in New Zealand who knew about it. It was disgraceful what she did. “I went across to have a look at the house after they kicked her out and God help the landlord when it re-opens. It would cost him thousands. It’s disgraceful. It must stink in there.”  He said the experience has brought the community together. He said: “I would like to see a good family go into that house. Hopefully we can have a say about who comes into the property because of what we’ve been through. “In the past few months life without her has been bliss. In some ways we are all better off for the experience.” Police have pledged to continue taking action to shut down problem properties. Chief Inspector John Owen said: “As the closure order comes to an end, we can confirm that the original occupant will not be returning to the address.

The little girl spotted the weird thing and told her mum, who had absolutely no idea what it is. The strange object is a black or brown colour and measures about 5cm by 3cm.  In a bid to try and work out what it is, she shared a photo on the parenting website Mumsnet .  She wrote: DH [darling husband] just gone away for three days, otherwise he would talk me down I\u0027m sure.

I honestly am so intrigued yet so horrified. Uggh. One mum added: WTF. I\u0027d be firebombing my house if I found that.  Others wanted her to poke it to see what happened. The woman replied to these suggestions saying: Briefly considered poking but I’m in charge of DC [darling child] so if I fall over in horror we are all a bit stuck. Just done 999 practice with DD just in case. Some have suggested it could be a snail or a wasps nest, but others disagree. One wrote: I think snail too. I think he has been crushed so that stuff has stuck to his shell, but has managed to crawl up the wall. It isn\u0027t a nest, they don’t stick to walls like that. He is a poor, injured snail who needs to be outside eating rhubarb. Another user replied: Definitely looks like a snail. They hibernate so it\u0027s probably been hiding in a dusty nook in your house all winter. Attic or somewhere.  But another argued: What kind of mutant f****** snails are rolling around the rest of the UK? Surely snails, look snail shaped? Others had some possibly less helpful suggestions. One said: That is NOT a snail. It\u0027s a portal to another world. I\u0027d move out!

The hangar in the municipality of Ostend has protected architectural status and plans are in place to convert it into a brothel as the red light district in the seaside town is being cleared. The brothel will be known as Hangar d\u0027amour and will be run by the same company that manages a 51-bedroom in Antwerp called Villa Tinto. The plan will see the town\u0027s red light district, known as Hazegras, cleared and moved into the hangar. Prostitution is legal in Belgium and renting property for such work has been legal since 1995.  Around 26,000 women are believed to work in the sexy industry there. It is estimated that 80 per cent of sex workers are victims of people trafficking or are exploited by gangs. There has been opposition to the plan with a non-profit describing it as madness. The non-profit, Oostendse Oosteroever, have been campaigning for the building to be turned into a museum. However, the mayor - Johan Vande Lanotte - says the hangar will be a safer environment for sex workers. He said: “The ladies will enter into a rental contract directly with the owner, as a result of which intermediaries will be excluded.

More than 11 tonnes of the whopper sea creatures have been dragged from the sea by authorities and even sunbathers have been spotted helping to remove them. The worrying incidents have taken place in the province of Malaga, in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia across the coast from the resort. According to local media, cleaning boats have already collected 11 tonnes of jellyfish from on both the eastern and western coasts of the province.  Authorities say the jellyfish species belongs to Pelagia Noctiluca, one of the most common in the Mediterranean Sea in that area. Although this jellyfish\u0027s sting is not fatal it is said to be painful and cause inflammation. It is recommended to wash the injury with salt water and notify the lifeguards at the beach. A video shared by a man in a kayak shows him sliding over the impressive mass of jellyfish. He says: This is ridiculous.  They don\u0027t fit on top of each other. Organisation Aula del Mar confirmed that this is the largest presence of jellyfish since 2012. Another plague took place in 2015, but with nowhere near as many jellyfish. Aula del Mal coordinate a mobile phone app called Infomedusa - translated at Jellyfish information - to warn people about the presence of jellyfish near the beaches. The yellow flag has been raised on the affected beaches over the weekend, meaning bathers should take precaution.

Chilling CCTV has been released showing the small child, wearing a floor-length white dress, following a man into the street in India. At one point, she apparently gets scared and can be seen running fast.  She gets about 50 metres from the man, before she stops and follows him again after he starts to make his way towards her.  The little girl had been a guest at a wedding in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, and had attended with her parents, according to local media.  After she was allegedly lured away, she was \u0027brutally\u0027 sexually assaulted, murdered and mutilated. Police say a stone was used to disfigure her face.  The CCTV shows a man walking with the girl along a desolated street at around 11.30pm. She was reportedly last seen alive holding the man\u0027s hand as they both disappeared into the darkness. The footage shows the man returning alone around 2.30am. On seeing the child missing from the marriage venue, the parents raised an alarm after which police officers started searching for the girl. The huge search ended after they recovered the body of the child on a hillock 500 metres away from the venue in the early hours of Thursday. Police have since arrested a suspect. He is said to be a member of the catering team hired for the marriage function.  An investigation is still underway and the suspect is being questioned. The post-mortem report has suggested a brutal sex attack, and the girl\u0027s face was said to have been badly mutilated by a large stone. Police have registered a case under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) act of Indian Penal Code. Dharmraj Meena, the Senior Superintendent of Police of Gwalior, said: “Our team reached the spot along with the forensic experts, after seeing the crime scene it is quite clear that the child had undergone a brutal sexual assault.

The priceless painting is said to be signed by the renowned Renaissance artist, who lived between 1452 and 1519. Named The Archangel Gabriel, it is believed to date back to 1471, when da Vinci would have been 18. Scientific research, which has taken three years, has convinced art historians that the painting was made by the artist.  It was discovered by descendants of an aristocratic Italian family. Respected expert Professor Ernesto Solari said, CNN reports: Thankfully, they realised it was something that shone a bit brighter than the other things they found when cleaning out the house, and that is when they called us. He said that the piece gives insight into the artist as a young man. Prof Solari claimed: This piece is the earliest work of Leonardo and has his earliest known signature - it is priceless.  Handwriting expert Ivana Rosa Bonfantino said the tiny signature, painted into the figure\u0027s jawline, matches that of da Vinci.  However Professor Martin Kemp, from the University of Oxford, is less convinced. He told The  : The handling of the hair is spectacularly unconvincing - it looks like vermicelli - and the details of the costume are also wrong. Da Vinci is considered to be one of the most talented people ever to have lived. His painting Salvator Mundi is the most expensive work ever sold, after it went under the hammer for $450.3 million in New York last year.  As well as painting masterpieces including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, he was renowned for his technical ingenuity, with his blueprints including flying machines while this science was in its infancy. He left behind notebooks full of scientific drawings which continue to amaze experts into the 21st century. Da Vinci has even been credited with inventing the helicopter, the parachute and the armoured tank. French historian Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries. He was born in Florence, Italy, and died in Amboise, France, at the age of 67.

The 57-year-old, who had suffered three days of constipation, is said to have had the huge build-up from faecal impaction. Long-term constipation can lead to the condition, where poo has built up in your rectum, the NHS says. This resulted in abdominal swelling which blocked the major vessel carrying blood to the man\u0027s right leg. He could barely walk and medics were unable to find a pulse in his right leg, according to a medical report.  His leg had even begun to go cold because of the lack of blood flow.   According to The Sun, the patient had leg pain for three days, constipation, stomach pains, nausea and was not able to move for 24 hours.  The case was reported in a BMJ article which said the man suffered from \u0027abdominal compartment syndrome\u0027. According to the NHS, compartment syndrome is a painful and potentially serious condition caused by bleeding or swelling within an enclosed bundle of muscles – known as a muscle compartment.

Wildlife control experts were called to remove the serpents, which looked to be at least 4ft in length each, from inside the unit. And others say they\u0027ve pulled plenty of the reptiles from similar hiding places - but there is one simple way to stop it from happening. Yes folks, believe it or not, we’ve also pulled plenty of them out of dryer and exhaust vents, said Virginia Wildlife Management and Control, sharing a viral video of the two snakes being rescued. If you don’t have guards on yours, let us know and we’ll be happy to install one on them, so you will NEVER have to worry about this happening to you.  The one-minute 27-second clip shared on Facebook shows the moment a wildlife expert rips open the pipe of the tumble dryer, in what appears to be a family home at an unknown location. A snake is revealed and a horrified onlooker can be heard saying: I can see its head. A child in the background can he heard repeatedly shouting as the snake is discovered and removed, clearly surprised to see it there.  The creature is slowly pulled from the pipe but appears to resist, before curling up once removed entirely. Another child can be heard saying: Let\u0027s keep it as a pet. The snake is then placed inside a white plastic bucket, before the expert turns his attention to locating the second reptile. He quickly finds the marginally smaller snake inside another section of the machine, before using the same technique to remove it.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion

dark blues famous league win remembered","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee Football Club’s most famous day came when they became league champions by beating St Johnstone on the final day of the 1961/62 season.Former Tele staff man and Blether with Brown columnist John Brown was at the game and he recalls a memorable day\u0026#8230“To get a feel of what is was like at Muirton Park, Perth, on April 28, 1962, I reckon you have to refer back to a couple of days previous.“That is when the last game of the season at Dens Park was taking place, with St Mirren visiting.“It was a Wednesday night fixture and Dundee and Rangers were neck and neck at the top of the league.“With the score at 1-0 to the hosts, St Mirren were awarded a penalty.“The 20,000 crowd were stunned and Dens Park fell silent in disbelief\u0026#8230 but massively erupted as Pat Liney pulled off a wonder save from Jim Clunie’s spot-kick.“Dundee almost immediately went down the park and Andy Penman netted the clincher for a 2-0 victory.“At the final whistle, there was the initial cheers, then silence again\u0026#8230 as the crowd waited for Rangers’ result at Pittodrie.“It was an eerie, uneasy and nervous hush for a few minutes until the over-excited announcer on the crackly sound system proclaimed\u0026#8230 “Aberdeen 1 Rangers NOTHING!!!!“Dens erupted and, as we walked down the stairs of the South Enclosure, ‘Hail, Hail The Dee Are Here’ rang out.“Dundee were two points ahead going into the final game.“So, on to the Saturday, and, upon waking, the first words I heard was my dad saying to my mother\u0026#8230 ‘It’s a glorious sunny day, we can’t fail.’“How true.“We journeyed through to Perth in my dad’s car in the company of my uncle and cousin.“I literally did not see one St Johnstone supporter among the Dark Blue masses.“The ground filled up quickly and my dad told me and my cousin to go down to the ‘dyke’ to get a better view.“The game unfolded just as you have heard and read a million times.“We are 3-0 up and the packed crowd are pushing down towards the ‘dyke’ in an attempt to get on to the pitch quickly to celebrate when the final whistle came.“I felt a bit crushed and uncomfortable at that point and a patrolling trackside policeman saw this and lifted me over.“As soon as my feet touched the ground, the ref blew\u0026#8230 and a tsunami of dark blue swamped on to the park.“I led the chase and just ran and ran.“I literally didn’t know where I was running to and ended up hugging skipper Bobby Cox on the halfway line.“There is an iconic photo of Bobby on the pitch being chaired by fans\u0026#8230 and I am somewhere in there under his backside!“We all just sang and danced and chanted and some of the Dundee players who got off the pitch eventually ventured into the main stand to received the plaudits.“We drove back to Dundee and went to a packed city square where the Dee players and officials were on view on the tiny balcony.“Compared to what would happen on such an occasion nowadays, it was really low-key.“As a delighted Dundee fan, I thought that this was the way it was always going to be\u0026#8230 but we now know otherwise!”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee bus firm to unveil new greener fleet with free wifi and usb charging","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee bus firm has unveiled a £4 million fleet of new vehicles that it hopes will be a breath of fresh air to locals.Xplore Dundee’s 14 low-emission “Emerald” buses, as the firm calls them, are double deckers built by Falkirk manufacturers Alexander Dennis Ltd.As well as packing modern tech such as free wifi, USB charging and “next stop” announcements, the buses come with low-pollutant hybrid engines that emit fewer greenhouse gases.The new vehicles were showcased at Discovery Point by Xplore’s new managing director Christine McGlasson to mark Clean Air Day.Ms McGlasson said the buses would be on the streets by the autumn.“We take our role in recognising and reducing our city’s air quality issues very seriously,” she said.“We are therefore actively embracing clean technology in our fleet because we want to run buses that are green inside and out. This is our message on Clean Air Day 2018 as we look to the future: buses are not part of the problem – they are the solution to pollution.”Dundee is one of several Scottish cities that will introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in the near future.LEZs will prevent older vehicles that do not meet strict emissions standards from entering certain parts of the city, in order to improve air quality and people’s health in the process.Health Secretary and Dundee East MSP Shona Robison and Dundee City Council’s city development convener Lynne Short were also at Discovery Point today.Ms Robison said: “This is a great boost to Dundee’s environmental credentials and will help to make our city greener.”Ms Short added: “Everyone benefits from better air quality but it is also everyone’s responsibility to think about their individual or corporate contribution and having a national Clean Air Day helps to do that in a very specific way.”Xplore plans to deploy most of its new vehicles on the service 22 route, which uses the city’s Seagate – one of Scotland’s pollution hotspots, according to air quality studies.It’s the latest step undertaken in Dundee to reduce vehicle emissions.The council already offers perks to electric vehicle owners, while European funding secured 12 hydrogen buses for city fleets in March.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people octogenarian to graduate at

Kids were then asked to identify school costs which might create a barrier to participating in school.Among the issues addressed were breakfast clubs, uniform, lunches and snacks, school trips, homework and attitudes to poverty.The report found that uniform is one of the most expensive outlays for families, particularly replacing worn and torn clothes — and if families cannot afford to replace them, it can leave pupils embarrassed.Some pupils are also coming into school unfed – and inconsistencies in breakfast clubs across the city means that there aren’t always spaces for children in need.The timing of events, such as at Halloween and Christmas, was also leaving a dent in parents’ pockets, or leaving children excluded because their mums and dads can’t afford, for example, a Halloween costume.The Child Poverty Action Group, which conducted a similar exercise in Glasgow: “There is still some way to go to ensure that all children and young people from low income households are able to access all of the same opportunities as their peers.”One Dundee mum who knows how expensive it can be to send children to school is Sara Hay, 36, from Linlathen.Sara has one child Brandon Davidson in P1 at Rowantree Primary School and her son Findlay will start after the summer. She said: “There’s no doubt sending your kids to school is expensive. By the time you buy uniforms, shoes, bags and even pay for dress-down days, it’s a lot of money.“You often feel guilty because you maybe can’t afford to buy your children what others have, but it comes down to making the right choice.“Rowantree Primary is very good. We have a support group that runs a swap-shop, which is a great help. I also get support from my family.”Children and families service convener Councillor Gregor Murray said the report is a “hard-hitting” piece of research that raises a number of questions.Councillor Murray added said: “We raised the school clothing grant in Dundee to £100 in recognition of the struggles that families were facing.“Significant assistance from the Scottish Government has allowed us to make progress in narrowing the poverty attainment gap.“This report about the cost of the school day gives us many issues to think over and solutions need to be carefully considered.”The report highlights a number of examples of good practice to alleviate the economic barriers facing pupils.One of these is Craigie High School, where new first-year pupils are all given a pencil case filled with stationery so every youngster starts on the same footing.John Dickie, director of CPAG in Scotland, said: “Many Dundee schools and staff working in them are clearly sensitive to the fact that lots of families are struggling financially, and there is fantastic work happening across the city to keep school costs low and to support families where needed.“But cost barriers still remain and are preventing too many children from getting the most out of their education.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b713ac0e65-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals demand action over eyesore at old dundee nursery and play area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “neglected” piece of land next to a disused building in Fintry has been branded an eyesore by angry residents.Grass, bushes and trees next to the former nursery school on Fintry Road have been left to grow for about a year, locals said today.The nursery closed nine years ago, and despite previous applications to convert the building, no plans have come to fruition.The council-owned land also houses play equipment.Elspeth Muir, 66, a domestic worker with NHS Tayside, has lived at Fintry Mills, overlooking the site, for more than 30 years.

The playpark was used occasionally but not any more.”Retired couple Katherine and Brian Perrie, who also live at Fintry Mills, said the extent of the overgrown land meant they no longer opened the windows at the back of their Abertay Housing Association property.They said the land was initially maintained when they moved in six years ago but it had become particularly overgrown in the past two years.Katherine, 67, added: “It’s been like that for a while.“As far as I can remember, the council has cut the grass once in about two years. It’s just a mess. We can’t open our windows now because you get all the insects and pollen from it.“It’s a disgrace to look out on to, just an eyesore. It was a nice view before, when it was maintained.”Brian, 70, said: “It used to be cut regularly but they’ve stopped for some reason.“It’s daft because the council cuts the grass at the front of the houses every fortnight, so it has the equipment and staff. It must just be budget cuts like everything else.“The last time it was cut was after I raised the issue with Abertay Housing Association, who reported it to the council.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “We will arrange for the grass to be cut as soon as possible.”The building served as a nursery for 50 years until it closed in 2009, and has remained empty since.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man admits exposing himself in dundee multi","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 52-year-old man admitted that he committed a sexual act in a public area at Elders Court on December 7 last year, while on bail.Allan May, of Elders Court, also admitted that on October 29, at the same multi-storey building, he walked about in the main communal entrance while having the lower half of his body completely exposed, also while on bail.Sentence was deferred until July 17 and May was granted bail.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new voucher referral system to be introduced at dundee foodbank","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new referral procedure is being introduced at Dundee Foodbank, starting next month.From Monday July 2, a “red voucher” system will replace the current telephone referrals.Organisations wishing to make a referral will need to fill in details on the red voucher and hand it over to the person they are referring.The person will then take the voucher to the foodbank, where it will be exchanged for food.The old telephone previously used for referrals will also be made redundant.Foodbank organisers said they were in the process of contacting referral partners to issue the new red vouchers.The change coincides with the foodbank relocating from the Full Gospel Church on Constitution Street to St John’s Episcopal Church on Albert Street, which will open on the same day as the new referral system is introduced.The final day at the Full Gospel Church will be Friday June 29.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys scraps supermarket plan for local school site scrapped","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for a Sainsbury’s supermarket in Carnoustie have been abandoned.The proposal for an outlet and adjacent retail store on the vacant site of the former Kinloch Primary School attracted fervent opposition.It was the first firm proposal to emerge for the site since the demolition of the school in 2010.It was brought forward in response to ideas which emerged from the Carnoustie design charrette, one of a series held across the Angus burghs.Bakery chain Greggs had been ready to build a new 6,000 sq ft food store and join Sainsbury’s in the near-£2 million “town square” transformation.Greggs pulled out last month and Sainsbury’s has also decided not to progress with the application.Carnoustie independent councillor David Cheape said it was a disappointing outcome for the town.“There were mixed views and opinions on the potential arrival of Sainsbury’s and Greggs,” he said.“When the latter pulled out I had hoped that this plan might still proceed but in a more aesthetically pleasing part of the Kinloch site.”Critics said the plan did not meet the “village-square” vision which emerged as one of the Carnoustie charrette aspirations for the site.Independent councillor Brian Boyd said: “I am not surprised Sainsbury’s have pulled out but I think this is because it now doesn’t fit their business model, with their merger with Asda, rather than objections for locals.”A spokesman for the supermarket said: “We’re disappointed we couldn’t progress with the application submitted by Cumbrae Property and we’re now considering our options.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b710797635-593x564.jpg ","title":"step by steps the stage is set for latest open air show at dundee waterfront","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPop icons Steps are just a few hours away from playing their open-air gig in Dundee — and excitement is reaching fever pitch as the stage for the show takes shape.Slessor Gardens will be packed with fans tonight eager to see the group perform some of their greatest hits.But before they do, the crowd will be treated to top tunes from Power of Muzik, Bjorn Again and boy band Blue.Concert-goers at the Waterfront venue will be able to warm up with some classic ABBA tunes, as well as singing along to Blue’s best known tracks All Rise and Fly by.Steps’ Faye Tozer spoke to the Tele earlier this year and revealed how much the band were looking forward to the city gig.“Oh my goodness we are so excited,” she said.“We have always been so lucky with our Scottish fans and had a lovely time when we were up north.“We’ve got some fantastic dancers.

He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the Tele’s build up concludes with our lowdown on the final section, Group H, possibly the least fashionable of all the groups, hipsters apart.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"New hope for little Rebecca  after 4-hour tumour op","story":"                          The family of a cancer-stricken toddler have been given cause to celebrate after a successful operation."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7952312.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths ditched summer holiday to get into the gym","story":"                          While exotic destinations and luxury travel were crammed into the bulk of the Celtic squad\u0027 June itinerary, Leigh Griffiths eschewed the planes, trains and automobiles for extra time in the gym."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7952652.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Parents in blast at    lack of communication    over strikes","story":"                          OUTRAGED parents have blasted East Dunbartonshire Council for a \u0026ldquolack of communication over school industrial action."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow walking tour guide gets street traders licence after just three weeks in the business","story":"                          GLASGOW\u0026rsquoS first all-year round walking tour guide has been awarded a street trader\u0027 licence."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7853754.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"The Sherlocks interview   Some of our best shows have been in Scotland ","story":"                          South Yorkshire indie stars The Sherlocks will reunite with Liam Gallagher at this year\u0027 TRNSMT, 24 hours after supporting the former Oasis frontman at his biggest solo show so far."},{"url":null,"title":"Ex-Celtic star Simon Donnelly and snooker legend John Higgins take part in charity golf day","story":"                          EX-Celtic star Simon Donnelly and snooker legend John Higgins were among the golfers taking part in a charity golf day for cancer."},{"url":null,"title":"Hollywood star Johnny Depp reveals who his Scots hero is during Glasgow visit","story":"                          Johnny Depp might have brought rock \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo roll to Glasgow with old pals Alice Cooper and Joe Perry \u0026ndash but he told Scots fans his own hero was William Wallace.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Revealed  Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard pops into secret plush cinema in Glasgow","story":"                          Steven Gerrard had\u0026nbsphis big week in Glasgow\u0026nbspfor the first day at Rangers -

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.

McInnes, who was returning for pre-season training with the Reds today, said: “We will definitely be competitive enough in the games against Burnley.“You would much rather play that calibre of team in the group stages but it is what it is.“Sometimes you get drawn against unknown teams in Europe and you have to go and try to find out a lot about them.“You are never really sure of the levels of the league they are in.“However, Burnley are playing in a league which is probably the strongest in the world at the minute.“You don’t need to motivate the players too much to get them ready or make sure there is no complacency for a type of game.”This will be the Reds’ fourth Battle of Britain in Europe against English top flight opposition.Aberdeen have previously faced Tottenham (1973) Liverpool (1980) and Ipswich Town (1981).Burnley will play in Europe for the first time since the 1966-67 season in the Inter Cities Fairs Cup having finished seventh in the English top flight.The Clarets have spent the majority of the last 40 years in the English lower leagues until a recent renaissance.Manager Sean Dyche led them to the top flight in 2016 by securing the Championship title.Burnley finished in 16th place in their first season back in the Premier League but shocked the top flight last season by qualifying for Europe.“They deserve that respect for all they have done in recent seasons, especially last season,” said McInnes.“We’ll be playing against a team that has done exceptionally well in what is regarded as the best league in the world.“It should be a fabulous contest. We are familiar with Burnley but we will obviously do our work to go into it in more depth as you would with any opponent.“It is a game that is instantly exciting but we instantly recognise that it is a challenge as well.“We will look forward to it when it comes along.”The first leg will be played on Thursday July 26 at Pittodrie, with the return at Turf Moor seven days later.But other details about the tie have still to be confirmed.McInnes hopes to have bolstered his squad with a number of new signings before facing Burnley. This summer he has already secured midfielder Chris Forrester for £200,000 on a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international midfielder Stephen Gleeson signed on until 2020 while Hamilton midfielder Lewis Ferguson has also joined.The Dons and Hamilton have yet to agree a training compensation fee for 18-year-old Ferguson and that is set to go to a tribunal.McInnes met former Rangers striker Kenny Miller, a free agent, while in Florida during the summer.The Reds are keen on securing Miller, 38, but the veteran is also being tracked by Hibs, Motherwell, Dundee and St Mirren.Miller is understood to have held talks with St Mirren boss Alan Stubbs and Livingston have targeted him for a player-manager role.Aberdeen are also keen on Hibs’ out-of-contract Scotland international midfielder Dylan McGeouch.It is understood he was offered the opportunity to become the highest paid player at Pittodrie but Rangers, Fulham, Blackburn and Brentford are also keen on the midfielder.McInnes has a policy of not commenting on any transfer speculation until a deal is done.However, the Dons boss confirmed he aims to have strengthened his squad further by the Battle of Britain.Asked on securing most of his signings before facing Burnley, he said: “We would like to.“We will be trying to do that and add to the signings we have made.“I

expected to vote on Wednesday over whether or not to suspend Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald.Holyrood’s Standards Committee has recommended the former SNP minister be suspended for a month without pay after he was found to have twice breached the code of conduct for MSPs.The married father-of-two, who now stands as an independent MSP, said he accepted the findings of the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in relation to the two breaches.He added he would abide by the outcome of a full parliamentary vote on the proposed sanctions, expected to take place in the middle of next week.The commissioner was asked by the committee to investigate Mr McDonald’s conduct after SNP MSP James Dornan made an official complaint in March.The investigation concluded that a social media message he had sent to a female member of staff “involved sexual harassment” because it “contained sexual innuendo by association”.Responding to the decision, Mr McDonald admitted the message, to a female member of staff employed by another MSP, was “inappropriate”.But he added: “Analysis by my solicitor suggested that, while I accepted the message was inappropriate, it did not constitute sexual harassment.”Mr McDonald also admitted the second breach of the code of conduct for MSPs, that he failed to treat a member of staff with respect by asking her to make a payment of £476 for a flat deposit and not reimbursing her for around 24 days.The MSP said the delay arose from a “loss of perspective on his priorities” after a serious family health issue but said he accepted “entirely” that he was wrong.Mr Dornan had alleged the woman had been a “targeted victim of harassment and sexual innuendo” at the hands of Mr McDonald.However, the commissioner found no evidence to support some of the allegations made, including that he “skulked” about the parliament waiting for the woman and contributed to her ill-health.Mr McDonald said: “The manner in which Mr Dornan chose to publicise his complaint, and make lurid allegations against me, has had a significant and lasting impact upon my personal mental health and wellbeing, and has thus affected my family.”Mr Dornan said: “After

go for spin","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSchool pupils from across the north-east drove spectators wild at a soapbox car event.Forty schools from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire put pedal to the metal in the race at the Grampian Transport Museum in Alford.The event, held by charity Green Power, offered pupils a way to learn STEM subjects in a practical way, by building an electric kit car, that was then raced against other schools.The kits were delivered to the school earlier in the year, and it was up to pupils and staff to put them together, complete with their own exterior designs.On the day, other than the races themselves, which take the form of drag, slalom and sprint events, the cars were judged on their body work, presentation and attitude.Macduff Primary School walked away as overall winners, seven points clear of their closest competitor, Airyhall Primary School.Gwen Sutherland, deputy head teacher at Macduff Primary, said: “There was a lot of preparation that went into it, from preparing the car, to planning the teams.“This is the third year that we did it, so we’ve built up a great knowledge of the event.”Gwen said race day “went really well”.She said: “The kids were very excited about it. It’s a fantastic opportunity for them.“The camaraderie between them was great, and they were working with the other schools that were there as well.“There was a real buzz.”The pupils didn’t feel like runaway winners during the competition, according to Gwen.She said: “They didn’t think they had won until their name was announced, so they were all shocked.“They worked really well as a team, and played to their strengths, which was great. Their behaviour was commendable.”Tony Scott, the Green Power ambassador at the Transport Museum, said: “It was a good day, we had to shorten the races because of the heavy rain, but it was a good day overall.“The kids really enjoyed the day as well.“I’m always surprised by how much the kids enjoy it, and they made memories that will last forever.“The most important thing is that it’s cross curricular, so if there’s a kid that’s not interested in the mechanical side, they can take part in something else, so it really does capture the whole curriculum across the school.”Tony believes that the event is “vital” for helping children understand STEM subjects. He said: “The kids get really engaged, so they’re doing schoolwork without having to do work.“It’s about getting them to do things that they don’t necessarily want to do.”A spokesman for the competition said: “We had the most teams ever participating with 40 schools attending.“Each school had their own unique take on their body work design and we would like to congratulate them as they each took part with great sportsmanship, despite the wet conditions.“It wouldn’t have been possible without our wonderful sponsor TAQA and their incredible volunteers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"play off final fracas sees cove boss sheran given two match suspension","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCove Rangers manager John Sheran has been handed a two-match suspension for his part in a fracas in the League Two play-off final.The manager of the Highland League champions will be banned for the first two matches of next season following a hearing at Hampden yesterday.Cove was fined £500 following an injury-time brawl in the second leg against Cowdenbeath.Sheran has been handed an imme-diate two game ban for Cove’s League Cup group games against Inverness Caley Thistle and Hearts, with an additional one-match ban suspended until the end of the 2018/19 season.The Aberdeen side were beaten 3-2 by Cowdenbeath at Central Park in the second leg of the League Two play-off final.The Blue Brazil won in controversial fashion with Jordyn Sheerin appearing to foul Cove goalie Stuart McKenzie, which stopped the keeper saving Brad Smith’s winning goal.Cove ended the game with eight men following the brawl in stoppage-time.Paul McManus was sent off for dissent and captain Eric Watson, Scott Ross, Sheran and Cowden boss Gary Bollan were dismissed for their involvement in the fracas.Sheran was given the one-game ban for breaching Rule 203, which states: “No member of team staff shall commit misconduct at a match.”He was given an additional one-game ban with a further one game suspended for breach of Rule 72 after criticising referee Stephen Kirkland and his fellow officials in his post-match interview.Cowden boss Bollan was given a one-game ban for also breaching Rule 203 and his assistant Ian Flaherty was handed a two-game suspension for breaching the same rule.Cove’s £500 fine was for breaching Rule 204, while Cowdenbeath were fined £1,000 for a breach of the same rule.It states: “Where three or more players and/or members of team staff from one team are involved in a confrontation with opposing players and/ or members of team staff of the opposing team during and/or directly after a match.”Meanwhile, Cove have placed Nick Gray on the transfer list.

One (on the second hole) was from 100 yards and it went 60 yards right.“I don’t think I’ve hit a bad shot.“It was a slug-fest out there today, but I was only four or five-over-par.“I didn’t have any expectations coming into this week and I always just try and play golf and it’s worked so far.”Sloman was set to take on another South African, Ernie Els’ nephew Jovan Rebula, in the quarter-finals today for a shot in the semis.It was a bad day for South Africa overall, with five of their players in the fourth round draw, but only one left at the end of play.Rebula beat Howley Hall’s Ben Hutchison by one hole to seal his progress.Elsewhere, Portmarnock’s Conor Purcell, after knocking out world number six Matthew Jordan by holing a 35-yard pitch from the rough on the 19th hole in the morning, defeated Adam Blomme of Sweden 3\u0026amp2.The 21-year-old Irishman, who grew up at Portmarnock, where his dad was pro, said his wonder pitch was “hit and hope”.The 58-degree wedge sent the ball over a bunker and then it rolled into the cup.After the later win, which sent him into the quarter-finals, Purcell said: “I’m surpassing whatever I thought I could I do, but I’ll keep playing my own game and see how things work out.“You can’t get ahead of yourself.”Purcell was set to take on David Micheluzzi, of Australia, today. The Royal Melbourne man beat Mexico’s Raul Pereda.Meanwhile, Filton’s Mitch Waite was set to play Sweden’s Christoffer Palsson and Tramore’s Robin Dawson was drawn against Kinsale’s John Murphy in all-Irish clash.Saturday’s winner over 36 holes at Royal Aberdeen is not only playing for an impressive trophy.A win in the 123rd edition of the competition will also them a place in the Open Championship and at next year’s Masters and US Open.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/05/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.News of £36m funding to support walking and cycling announced by Transport Minister Humza Yousaf is to be welcomed, albeit part of an £80million funding pot already allocated.Far too often, we experience how sharing roads among pedestrians, cyclists and motorists leads to unwanted collisions that could have been prevented had the road conditions and visibility been better. Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

Trainees will be part of the charity’s gardening teams at Brodick, Crathes, Culzean, Greenbank, Hill of Tarvit and Kellie Castle for the next two years.The group will come together regularly throughout the two-year programme for training at Oatridge College, West Lothian.Ann Steele, head of heritage gardening at the National Trust for Scotland, said: ‘Skills shortage is an issue affecting the whole of the horticulture industry, but it’s particularly important for us to address because we love and care for so many of Scotland’s most significant and important heritage gardens.’The National Trust for Scotland currently employs 70 gardeners and has a history of developing gardening talent through its School of Heritage Gardening at Threave, which has been operational for the past 50 years. However, demand is outstripping supply and extra measures are being put in place to safeguard the future of Scotland’s heritage gardens.For more information about the gardening apprentice scheme visit nts.org.uk/charity/vacancies\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal round the world with mark without leaving scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/06/18, 7:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowRecord-breaking Scottish adventurer and cyclist Mark Beaumont is getting ready for a major cross-Scotland challenge in aid of the STV Children\u0026#8217s Appeal \u0026#8211 and he\u0026#8217s looking for 80 cycling fanatics to come along for the ride .The coast-to-coast cycle will set off on Saturday September 22 from his former home village of Tayinloan in Kintyre, continue through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park and the Cairngorms, over Glenshee before heading for the finish line in Aberdeen – a gruelling total of 240 miles.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12385832.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_200317mackay_02JPG.jpg","title":"campaign save sanctity loans set","story":"NewsCampaign to save sanctity of Loans set to end in victoryFor the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet11:47, 15 JUN 2018NewsLand earmarked for housing in 2014 adjacent to Loans (Image: Euan McCall/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA strong campaign to save the sanctity of the village of Loans is set to end in victory. Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge set to reopen early","story":"AN historic bridge near Melrose will reopen to traffic from tomorrow (Friday).\nThe \u0026pound640,000

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7560015.jpg?htype=203\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  500 000 revamp of Musselburgh s Iceland complete","story":"              A SUPERMARKET store has been given a makeover at a cost of more than \u0026pound500,000.  Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7355363.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"All smiles as Jean-Claude Juncker meets Irish president in Dublin","story":"              Jean-Claude Juncker has met President Michael D Higgins on the second day of his visit to Ireland.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Yes we\u0026rsquore Boyzone, but we\u0026rsquove got our own, individual styles and sounds in music. We collaborated and made this album into a bit of a shuffle.    The day the guys announced their last tour, they did so in a heart rending statement which made reference to \u0026ldquothe loss of Stephen which \u0026ldquoleft scars that we will carry as a band forever.

It\u0026rsquos nice to represent all five of us though.  Having always been on the music scene, even after \u0026ldquosplitting in 1999, talking to Shane, it really does feel like this is the final goodbye.

The campaign is in response to a survey carried out by the visitor attraction last week.  It found 72 per cent of Scots support a day to celebrate William Wallace, with 42 per cent declaring him the bravest Scot ever.  Rusty, 58, said: \"It\u0026rsquos a great idea and about time. You have a Burns night, there should be a Bruce day as well but a Wallace day\u0026rsquos a good idea - he\u0026rsquos a hero.  \"He should be more recognised and I believe there should be a Wallace Day. He was forgotten for many years and through Braveheart he was reinvented.\"  The survey was carried out by 500 people aged over 16, between June 8, 2018 and June 11.  var panels = panels || []    var panel = {    name : \u0027ballot\u0027,    target: \u0027ballot_188178704518748\u0027,    params: {ballot_id: \u002718748\u0027, template: \u0027responsive\u0027, callbak: function() {ballotVote.init()}}}panels.push(panel)  And more than a third who took part in the study said they have more of an affinity with William Wallace than Saint Andrew.  Onlooker Angela McMahon, 59, an NHS employee, said: \"I actually do think it\u0026rsquos a great idea, he\u0026rsquos world-renowned, and the Braveheart film with Mel Gibson raised a lot of awareness.  \"I\u0026rsquom all for things that raise the awareness of Scottish heritage.\"  Robert Anderson, 55, a web developer, said: \"If you look at it from an English point of view they always have big days for national characters.  \"Saint Andrew\u0026rsquos Day, I couldn\u0026rsquot even tell you when that is.  \"But with St George\u0026rsquos Day and Saint Patrick\u0026rsquos everyone knows when they are. I think it\u0026rsquos a great idea.\"  A week-long series of campaigning and petitioning is set to take place from Monday in various locations across the country.  Scots are encouraged to rally together and #VoteWallace.  Poll stations, horseback tannoy\u0026rsquos and Wallace\u0026rsquos army march are just some of the activities planned to mobilise voters.  Lynne Hughes, from the Edinburgh Dungeon events team, said: \"It\u0026rsquos been fantastic, the sun\u0026rsquos shining, we\u0026rsquore through from Edinburgh to see the people of Glasgow and campaign for our national Wallace Day.  \"People are loving it, it\u0026rsquos great fun. We\u0026rsquove been really well received.  \"Seventy-two per cent of Scots say they want a national day to celebrate William Wallace so we\u0026rsquore going to take it as far as we can because it\u0026rsquos something that we strongly believe in.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7951691.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Children travelling to school by car exposed to twice as much pollution as those who walk","story":"              CHILDREN driven to school by car are exposed to twice as much traffic pollution as pupils walking along busy roads, research reveals today.  Fumes sucked in through the air conditioning systems turns cars into pollution traps, especially in heavy traffic.

The findings are based on experiments carried out using air pollution monitors in various UK locations - including Busby in East Renfrewshire and East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire - to coincide with Clean Air Day. The other sites were Manchester, Leeds and London.  It was led by environmental charity, Global Action Plan.  In Scotland, 59 per cent of primary age children walk to school and 30 per cent travel by car, according to the most recent national travel survey.

Professor Jonathan Grigg, a fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and an expert in paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough parents can reduce this impact by walking on less polluted roads and taking public transport, [UK governments] must take further steps to reduce toxic emissions from all roads.    The tests were conducted using air pollution monitors, called micro-Athelometers, attached to the back packs of children or carried at shoulder height by adults.  On average, the experiments found that children walking to school on a busy route were exposed to 2.5 times more pollution from petrol and diesel exhaust fumes than pupils on a quiet route, while youngsters were breathing in 30 per cent more particulates and nitrogen oxide fumes than the adults.

John Bynorth, from Jackton, near East Kilbride, took part in the experiment with his children, four-year-old Daisy and Mitzi, aged two, who attend a nursery school in Busby.  Mr Bynorth, who works for Environmental Protection Scotland, the agency coordinating Clean Air Day events in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot aware that my children could be more exposed to air pollution but looking at the facts \u0026ndash it is obvious. They are small and so much closer to fumes.  \"The results of this research are quite shocking really and something needs to be done about air pollution for the sake of our children.  \"Children are too young to speak up about air pollution so the adults have got to do something about it now.  Joe Farrington Douglas, head of charity Asthma UK, said the findings were \"really shocking\" for children with the condition.  He added: \u0026ldquoThese deadly fumes could leave them gasping for breath and at risk of having a life-threatening asthma attack.\"  Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u0027s transport minister, said: \u0026ldquoPoor air quality is bad for everyone, and we know that for the oldest and youngest in our society and those with existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, air quality is an especially serious issue.  \"This is why we have committed to introducing Low Emission Zones into Scotland\u0026rsquos four biggest cities between 2018 and 2020.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ghostly forests spring up all over Scotland as moths get set to fly","story":"              THEY are the \u0026lsquoghostly\u0026rsquo forests of cobwebbed trees whose spectre haunts woodlands throughout Europe.  Now the sinister sight of cherry trees draped in eerie cobwebs is taking hold in Scotland after the beast from the east Siberian storm and recent heatwave created perfect conditions for the phenomenom.  Huge numbers of bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars has created the spectre in woodlands across the country as they spin elaborate webs to protect them from predators.  They feed on bird cherry trees which are found across Europe and when they emerge fully grown, they become distinctive white moths with five rows of black dots.  The larvae, which are about an inch long, make large communal silvery webs for protection and then feast on the surrounding leaves, stripping the trees bare.  There are eight species of ermine moths in this country and 2,400 species of moths in the British Isles and they usually pupate into adult moths in July or August.  The Woodland Trust Scotland has been receiving many reports of the ghostly looking trees in recent days with worried callers expressing alarm at the trees being stripped of all vegetation.  But the trees are not killed and will recover next year, by which time the caterpillars will have found somewhere else to spin their webs.  The Trust has received calls about outbreaks at Formonthills in Glenrothes and at its own Geordie\u0027s Wood at Glen Devon with the species enjoying a bumper year across many parts of the country.  George Anderson of the Trust said: \"Every few years this species explodes in numbers and they strip the host tree of its leaves. Trees normally recover the following year so it is not as drastic as it looks.  It does look very sinister as they drape entire trees in their silk. We have had some enquiries from people concerned that they were seeing oak processionary moth.  \"These are a real problem in the south of England and cause severe allergic reactions but thankfully they have not been found in Scotland. It is the bird cherry ermine moth we are seeing at the moment and it is entirely harmless.\"  The bird cherry moth, Latin name Yponomeuta evonymella, has a maximum wingspan of less than an inch and is found all over Europe.  There are hundreds of known species of ermine moths, and most of the time they go completely unnoticed.  But when it comes to spinning elaborate webs, no creature can match the power of ermine moth caterpillars. The behaviour is called \u0026ldquotenting, and only some species are able to manage it.  Every now and again, thousands of the tiny moths show up en masse and it is happening more frequently.  By working together, they are able to conceal themselves in a protective blanket. Like a giant invisibility cloak, the veil confuses birds and other predators well enough to keep them at bay while the caterpillars feed.  As the ermines move from tree to tree, they have to cover their tracks and so they keep their protection with them.  Over time everything in their path, from cars, to street signs, to grass, becomes shrouded in white, a scene which has been nicknamed the \u0026ldquowalk of ghosts.  One theory suggests that the super-webs form when multiple females lay their eggs on the same plant, in areas where food is scarce such as housing developments.  Other experts suggest that climate change is having an impact as the eggs tend to do better over warm and damp winters.  Experts believe that the sever storms which swept in from Siberia in March followed relatively shortly after by a prolonged heatwave has provided perfect conditions for the moths, while killing off their parasitic predators.  Tom Prescott, Senior Conservation Officer at Butterfly Conservation Scotland said: \"They are targeted by parasitic wasps and flies who enter their bodies and hatch out when the moths should and kill them off.  \"It\u0027s why they make this incredible web, they hope to keep the parasites and other predators out, it\u0027s like a very large disguise.  \"It just takes two or three to get inside the blanket for the moth numbers to be dramatically reduced, this is why some years there are lots of them, while in other years you can hardly see them.  \"We don\u0027t know for sure but the cold spell could have hit the parasites numbers while the recent warm spell has made it great for the caterpillars, one minute it was grey and overcast and the Spring and Summer both seemed to appear at once.  \"We have another species in Scotland, the Marsh Fritillary, which spins similar webs to protect it from its only known parasite, but there are smaller numbers of them and its population fluctuates much more from year to year.  \"But in truth, we don\u0027t really understand everything about the bird cherry ermine months and the webs but it can certainly put on a show\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7953768.jpg?type=article-full","title":"What s your favourite Scottish album ","story":"              The Herald is looking to find Scotland\u0027s favourite album. Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.

Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.

Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arm\u0027s-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements. We expect to give an update on this over the coming weeks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP government budget underspend almost   500m","story":"              THE Scottish Government underspend was almost half a billion pounds last year, prompting claims of mismanagement and ministers sitting on an unused \u0026ldquoslush fund.  The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.  He said that the net extra being carried forward into 2018/19 was \u0026pound66m, or just 0.2 per cent of the overall fiscal budget, and that this would be done through the Scotland Reserve pot, making it available \u0026ldquoto support management of future budget volatility.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend was \u0026ldquonothing short of a scandal, given ministers had cut \u0026pound1.5bn from councils since 2011, and demanded Mr Mackay apologise to workers facing the axe while he sat on an \u0026ldquoSNP government slush fund.  He said: \u0026ldquoMoney is piling up in his slush fund for his annual bribe to win Green votes to get his budgets passed.  \u0026ldquoThis is simply a gross mismanagement of the Scottish finances by a Finance Secretary who is clearly out of his depth. Derek Mackay must apologise to communities across Scotland that have been damaged by his reckless actions.  Tory Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoDerek Mackay might like to fool us all into thinking this \u0026pound453m underspend figure is an insignificant sum. But it\u0026rsquos higher than what the SNP\u0026rsquos independence blueprint [Growth Commission] said it would cost to create a separate state.  \u0026ldquoThe finance secretary is having to put money aside to meet a projected shortfall in tax revenues due to Scottish economic underperformance."},{"url":null,"title":"Bank Holiday plan if home nation reaches World Cup Final","story":"              The UK should have an extra bank holiday whenever one of the home nations\u0027 football teams reaches the final of the World Cup, the shadow foreign secretary has said.  Emily Thornberry was famously sacked from the Labour front bench in 2014 for a tweet apparently sneering at a white van driver\u0027s display of the cross of St George on his house months after the last World Cup.  But she sought to repair relations with the nation\u0027s fans by offering the prospect of a day off to nurse hangovers the morning after an appearance by England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the final game of the tournament.  And she called on the Royal Mail to \"reconsider\" its decision to ban postmen from flying the flag on their vans.  She admitted she was not herself a fan of the game - and proved her point by going on to suggest the World Cup came round \"every five years\" - but insisted she did not think there was anything wrong with supporters displaying the flag.  \"I think one of the things about the World Cup is that we do get lots of flags out and I think that there\u0027s nothing wrong with that,\" she said.  \"If it\u0027s true, these reports we are hearing from the Royal Mail, I do hope that they reconsider because I think that there is no problem with this at all. This is a time for us to celebrate.\"  Ms Thornberry\u0027s comments came at a speech to journalists at a Westminster lunch, where she was greeted with a display of England flags laid on by reporters who were not about to let her forget the biggest gaffe of her political career.  But a smiling Islington South MP took the joke on the chin, telling reporters that in her north London constituency there were all sorts of flags on show during the World Cup.  \"I can\u0027t pretend that I have the greatest interest in football, and I suspect that there\u0027s quite a lot of people like that,\" she said.  \"But I tell you how you could get more interest in football. What about if the Government were to suggest, for example, that if one of the nations of the United Kingdom were to get into the finals... the next day will be a bank holiday?  \"Why don\u0027t we do that every five years and that would help to get everybody behind whichever team it was?\"  Ms Thornberry branded Theresa May a serial liar as she issued an impassioned plea for more honesty in politics.  She said she would personally be ready to take TV presenter Richard Madeley\u0027s \"three strikes and you\u0027re out\" challenge of having an interview shut down if she did not give a straight answer - as happened to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson last month.  Ms Thornberry said there had been an \"increasing normalisation of dishonesty in modern politics\", citing the rise of US President Donald Trump as a sign that even the most senior politicians are now ready to say things they know to be untrue.  \"This normalisation of dishonesty has also crept into all sides of British politics, in part I believe as a result of the debate around Brexit,\" she said.  She named the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers and the pro-EU Back Together group of MPs, who she said were each engaged in \"earnest debate\" about how to get the best Brexit deal, when in fact one side wanted no deal and the other did not want to leave the EU at all.  And she added: \"Just look at the Prime Minister who, in the space of one interview last Sunday, claimed that she would fund a \u0026pound20 billion boost on NHS spending primarily through the \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027.  \"She claimed that the Brexit transitional period would definitely finish at the end of 2020. She claimed that she had not misled Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry on the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 amendment.  \"And after all that she had the sheer chutzpah to say - and I quote - that she is a woman of her word.\"  Ms Thornberry said: \"When it comes to what Jeremy (Corbyn) has called straight-talking honest politics and the kind of approach I\u0027ve outlined today, that does mean setting your standards high.  \"And, yes, it means we will fail those standards from time to time and we will be criticised and mocked as a result. But I would far rather that than having no standards at all.  Answering questions from Westminster journalists, Ms Thornberry declined three times to discuss allegations that Labour general secretary Jennie Formby was previously a member of Militant, insisting she did not know if that was the case.  And said she had smoked cannabis \"a long time ago\", but no longer thought it should be legalised for recreational use."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7957319.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots hotel adds midge burgers  delicacy  to the menu as  a bit of fun ","story":"              A SCOTS hotelier has claims to have created a burger from midges which has he describes as a \"delicacy\" that has proved surprisingly popular with guests.

A new study found those with the neurological disorder had twice the levels of two strains of herpes, HHV-6A and HHV-7, than those without the condition.  The research, published in journal Neuron, offers \"the most compelling evidence ever\" pointing to a possible viral trigger for Alzheimer\u0027s, the authors said.  Experts stressed it was not clear if the viruses caused dementia or were caused by it.  The study, using evidence from post-mortem brain tissue, was carried out by researchers from Mount Sinai Health System in New York in the US.  Lead author Dr Joel Dudley said: \"If it becomes evident that specific viral species directly contribute to an individual\u0027s risk of developing Alzheimer\u0027s or their rate of progression once diagnosed, then this would offer a new conceptual framework for understanding the emergence and evolution of Alzheimer\u0027s at individual, as well as population, levels.\"  Sam Gandy, professor of neurology and psychiatry, and co-author of the study, said: \"This is the most compelling evidence ever presented that points to a viral contribution to the cause or progression of Alzheimer\u0027s.\"  Studies have previously suggested that viruses might be linked with Alzheimer\u0027s but the new research suggests a relationship between viruses and the activity of genes associated with the disease.  Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer\u0027s Society, said: \"The relationship between viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s disease has been an area of interest for researchers for a while, but it is still unclear if higher levels of viruses cause dementia or are caused by it.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said the viruses highlighted in the study were not the same as those that caused cold sores.  Instead they were much more common forms which most people carried, usually without any problems.  He added: \"While the findings indicate a link between the activity of these viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s, they don\u0027t tell us whether they contribute to the development of the disease, help the brain to cope with the disease, or just occur alongside Alzheimer\u0027s processes without having an impact on the health of the brain.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove  SNP are following in my footsteps with post-Brexit plans","story":"              MICHAEL Gove has insisted SNP ministers are following in his footsteps with their plans for farming after the UK leaves the European Union.  The UK Environment Secretary said proposals for a five-year transition period in which farming subsidies would continue after Brexit were \u0026ldquotaking a leaf out of his department\u0026rsquos book.  It comes as Scottish Secretary David Mundell accused the SNP of mining \u0026ldquofake grievance\", despite engaging positively with UK ministers behind the scenes.  Earlier this week, the SNP outlined post-Brexit plans for Scottish farmers that would see subsidies kept in place and Brussels red tape slashed over a five-year transition period.  It said the proposals went further than the UK Government, which has said all subsidies provided by the EU will continue until the end of the current parliamentary term in 2022.  But visiting the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said: \"I think they\u0027re taking a leaf out of our book.  \"They understand that life outside the European Union means you can remove some bureaucracy from the lives of farmers, and that has to be a good thing.\"  He insisted the UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the future of farming had been very well received, adding: \" I think [that] suggests the path that we want to take agriculture south of the border is one that\u0027s got universal support.  \"Here in Scotland we respect the fact there is a devolved administration that will make its own decisions, but it\u0027s encouraging that the direction of travel the Scottish Government wants to take is one that\u0027s following in our footsteps.\"  Mr Gove also pledged that Scottish farmers would always receive \u0026ldquospecial treatment because they face unique challenges.  He was questioned about a long-anticipated review into the distribution of EU farm subsidies between Scotland and the rest of the UK, amid claims Scottish hill farmers are owed \u0026pound160m from the Treasury.  He said: \"We\u0027re going to make sure that Scotland receives the support that it needs in the future.  \"And we\u0027re going to make sure that the unique circumstances of Scotland\u0027s geography and Scotland\u0027s farming sector are reflected in the allocations that we make in the future.\"  Mr Gove said he hoped an Agriculture Bill detailing the UK Government\u0027s plans for farming post-Brexit would be published at the end of July.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the message from the SNP at Westminster was \u0026ldquolets weaponise Brexit as an opportunity to take forward independence.

The Chancellor used his annual Mansion House speech to City figures in London to confront attacks from Brexiteer critics, who have condemned the financial department on his watch.  In front of an audience including Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Mr Hammond said the Treasury would be the \"champion of prosperity for the British people\" after Brexit but it would be \"working and trading closely\" with the EU.  His words followed a secret recording of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, who was heard describing the financial heart of the UK Government as \"basically the heart of Remain\".  As well as recognising Britain\u0027s EU membership since 1973 and the importance of trade, the Chancellor said the post-Brexit landscape should reflect the scale of goods travelling between Dover and Calais, continental defence and security co-operation and \"centuries of shared history and culture\".  He explained: \"So as we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decades...that maintains low friction borders and open markets.  \"That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027 rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU but working and trading closely with it.  \"And part of that successful future partnership must be a mechanism that enables UK EU financial services trade to continue delivering the benefits of open markets and deep regulatory co-operation.  \"Of course, we recognise that this will be a new kind of relationship, reflecting a new, and fair, balance of rights and responsibilities.\"  At the start of June, Theresa May said she had full confidence in Mr Johnson after he told a private dinner there was a risk Brexit \"will not be the one we want\" and would keep the UK \"locked in orbit\" around the EU.  At the gathering of the Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite campaign group, he claimed negotiations were approaching a \"moment of truth\" and warned of a Brexit \"meltdown\".  That followed criticism from Priti Patel, the former International Trade Secretary, who accused the Chancellor and the Prime Minister of \"negativity\" and urged a \"better vision for the future\" after Brexit.  Mr Carney used his own speech on Thursday night to say he believed an \"ambitious\" financial services relationship with the EU - founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation - remained \"feasible\".  Echoing the Government\u0027s mantra of a post-Brexit \"global\" Britain, he said: \"Having put in place the pillars of responsible, open financial system, we are ready for deeper global financial partnerships with the emerging economies that will be the most important drivers of global growth in the decades ahead.\"  To this end, the Bank would deepen its supervisory co-operation with major emerging economies and develop infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows, he explained.  Mr Carney said it also wanted to help enable UK households and businesses to transact \"anywhere, anytime with anyone whether around the corner or around the world\".  The Canadian used the speech to say that financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  Responding the Chancellor\u0027s \u0026pound1.2 billion capital injection onto the Bank\u0027s balance sheet, alongside reforms to its framework, the Governor said: \"We now have a balance sheet fit for purpose. One that reflects the Bank\u0027s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential policy and resolution. And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability.\"  The Chancellor also used his speech to announce the creation of a Green Finance Institute based in the capital, jointly funded by government and the City of London.  He also said a Financial Services Skills Taskforce would be set up by TheCityUK, led by former City Minister Mark Hoban, to \"meet the long-term skills needs of the sector over the coming decades and creating opportunities for the next generation\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7958073.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Forgotten history of the  Glasgow Serbs  who took rugby home","story":"              THEY came to Scotland with little more than the clothes upon their backs, refugees from a war which set the continent of Europe ablaze.  Yet when they finally left for home years later, they returned not as heroes of the battlefield but as the conquerors of the rugby pitch, taking a their knowledge of the game back to their native Serbia, where it has flourished.  Most gained their love for the oval ball during a stay at George Heriots School in Edinburgh, where they are fondly remembered.  But now, on the centenary of their greatest triumph, the story of the Serbian rugby boys of Glasgow has been brought to light by a historian of the game in their native country.    Serbia\u0026nbspsuffered greatly during World War One  In August 1916, 27 boys aged between 12 and 19 arrived in Scotland traumatised and bewildered after the tide of war swept over Serbia.  Their home country had held out bravely against the might of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, but had finally been defeated by the combined forces of Germany, Bulgaria and Imperial troops.  More than 100,000 people died fleeing across the Albanian mountains, and the boys were among the weary refugees who survived, arriving in Britain by boat from Corfu.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspObituary - Dougie Jackson, veteran rugby player who played for Scotland and Hawick  Unable to speak a word in English, they were taken in by families and schools, with one group ending up at Heriots and another at Hillhead High School and other establishments in Glasgow.  The youngsters talent for the sport and athletics was quickly noticed, and soon they were introduced to rugby.  Within months, three were playing for the Heriot\u0027s highly regarded first team alongside future Scotland internationals, while in Glasgow 18 were quickly drafted into the teams in their schools.  Many of this group would go on to have substantial careers on the rugby field, according to Slavisa Milenkovic, Secretary of the Krusevac rugby club in Serbia, who has researched their time in Scotland.  He said: \"The Serbian rugby team in Edinburgh was the largest, most organized and of the highest quality, but their story ended in June 1919 when they were left the city.  \"But, the Serbs also played rugby in other Scottish cities they were located in during the First World War, and the best Serbian rugby players performed in Glasgow.\"  In 1918, the boys from Edinburgh and Glasgow formed the first Serbian national team, winning a match played in Edinburgh in front of a crowd of more than 8,000.  This was the first team to even play under the Serbian flag and is still held as the genesis of rugby for the Balkan country.  The same year a group also travelled to Ayr and beat a team from the local Academy, their arrival heralded in a newspaper report entitled \"The Visit of the Serbian Boys\".

The best-known of the Serbs was Slavoljub Djordjevic, who went on to play more than 100 games in Scottish competitions, first for Hillhead and later for Glasgow University Blues, where he studied to be a doctor.    Slavoljub Djordjevic/Stevan George  Djordjevic, a successful fullback, later married a Scottish woman and changed his name to Stevan George. He served as a ship\u0027s surgeon on troop transports during the Second World War and later worked as a doctor on board Cunard liners, eventually settling in the Bahamas.  Mr George, a father-of-three, was later awarded an OBE for his services to the Island communities, died in Nassau aged 67.  Another who enjoyed a long career was Dragoljub Stojanovic, who was a frequent turn-out for Hillhead between 1920 to 1926, playing at all levels.  In Edinburgh, Dimitrije Dulkanovic, who was known as the school\u0027s \"flying wing three-quarter\", also went on to train as a doctor, and set up the country\u0027s first rugby club in Belgrade.  Dr Dulkanovic died in 1995, aged 95, and was buried in his old school tie.

Earlier this week, the Nationalist leader in the Commons intensified the political rhetoric when he denounced the Scottish Secretary as \u0026ldquoyellow for not speaking in a debate and a \u0026ldquodismal failure in his role at the Scotland Office.  He accused Mr Mundell of \u0026ldquostabbing Scotland in the back over the devolved powers controversy, declaring: \u0026ldquoHe fails to stand up for Scotland as a country, fails to stand up for our Parliament, he sees us as subservient. That\u0027s why the Secretary of State needs to go. He is quite simply unfit for the office he holds.\"  Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos remarks came just days after he was ordered from the Commons by the Speaker and led a mass walkout of SNP MPs from the chamber.  Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.  But when the Highland MP was asked if Mr Salmond was pulling the party leadership\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, he responded with a firm \u0026ldquoNo.  Mr Blackford also insisted his angry remarks directed at Mundell were not meant to be personal.  \u0026ldquoI was robust in how I spoke because the Secretary of State has failed to defend Scotland at every turn, he has been a complete failure, he declared.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot wish to be personal about the Secretary of State but on the lack of ability in serving Scotland\u0026rsquos interest, as defined by the Government itself, it is not good enough.  The party leader made clear he had not accused individual MPs of being \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish but, rather, Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government.  A Whitehall insider suggested the SNP leadership was losing the argument on the Brexit Bill, which was why it was resorting to \u0026ldquocheap personal attacks.  Meanwhile, as Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Michael Russell, her Brexit Minister, headed for Guernsey to attend the British-Irish Council, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will also be at the meeting, stressed how, despite the strong disagreements with Edinburgh over the Brexit Bill, the UK Government was committed to improving the depth of its co-operation with the SNP administration.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the inevitable political noise as we unpick the complexities of our membership of the EU, I will ensure that we maintain the depth of our ongoing engagement with the Scottish Government, including this week at the British-Irish Council in Guernsey. I hope that the Scottish Government will maintain their own side of that relationship.  He added: \u0026ldquoBy working together, we will help secure a deal that sees us leave the European Union as a more modern country where all four nations have their voices heard but also as one United Kingdom as the people of Scotland voted for in 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"Younger generation have little chance of becoming wealthy  report claims","story":"              Young people today have less chance of becoming truly wealthy than any previous post-war generations, according to a new report.  Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Poll  UK wants second EU referendum","story":"              ALMOST half of voters want a second referendum on Brexit, according to a new poll released on the eve of the second anniversary of the historic vote to leave the EU.  And the survey for ITV1\u0027s Good Morning Britain suggested that a fresh poll would produce a very different outcome, with the UK voting to remain in the EU by a margin of 53% to 47%.  The projected result effectively reverses the referendum of June 23 2016, when Leave took 53% of votes, compared to 48% support for Leave.  Pollsters Survation found that 48% of those questioned wanted a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, against just 25% who did not. Some 18% said they did not have an opinion and 9% did not know.  Those supporting a new referendum included 35% of Leave voters and 66% of those who back Remain.  The survey found that 43% of voters back a \"soft Brexit\" - in which the UK would stay in both the single market and customs union - while 37% favour a \"hard Brexit\" in which Britain would leave both.  Some 57% of 2017 Labour voters backed a soft Brexit, against 23% who prefer a hard version.  Almost half (47%) of more than 1,000 people questioned thought leaving the EU without a deal would be bad for Britain, compared to 32% who said it would be good for Britain.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: \"This new polling shows just how much momentum is building behind the campaign for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal.  \"This Saturday will see tens of thousands from all over the UK marching for a People\u0027s Vote in London and support is growing across the country.  \"With the negotiations in chaos, with the Government making a total mess of Brexit and with Parliament paralysed, now is the time for people to take back control of the process.\"  Eloise Todd of the Best for Britain campaign said: \"MPs from all parties risk being two years out of date.

Just 17% of those taking part could identify the correct definition of the customs union, while 38% chose the correct description of the single market.  Nearly two-fifths (39%) said they had a \u0027limited\u0027 understanding of the issues around the Irish border, while a further fifth (19%) said that they didn\u0027t know anything about or hadn\u0027t heard of the issue.  Some 40% thought Brexit would make the relationship between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland more distant, compared to 30% who thought it would make no difference and 10% that it would make the relationship closer.

Mike Russell said the Scottish Government no longer trusted UK ministers following a breakdown in relations over the handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  He added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances\" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.  MPs approved parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill related to devolution after less than 20 minutes of debate last week, despite the Scottish Parliament voting against granting formal consent for the Bill.  Under the Sewel Convention, Westminster does not normally legislate on devolved matters without Holyrood\u0027s approval.

Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said: \"We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK Government is refusing to operate them.  \"For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we\u0027ve presently got is a situation where the UK Government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.\"  He said that, while there was \"practical work\" to do to prepare for Brexit, \"it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don\u0027t trust the UK Government with it\".

Official statistics show 26 of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 local authorities intend to draw on their general reserves in the current financial year, up from 24 last year.  Seven councils - Clackmannanshire, Eilean Siar, Moray, West Dunbartonshire and East, South and North Ayrshire - plan a second year of double-digit raids in percentage terms.  In the most extreme case, Moray, which has been beset by political instability, plans to use 31.5 per cent of its reserves in 2018-19, after using 30.5 per cent in 2017-18.  Earlier this year the Accounts Commission said it was \"seriously concerned\" about acute financial problems at Clackmannanshire, and said using reserves to avoid difficult political decisions was \u0026ldquounsustainable.  The watchdog also warned Moray - which has gone from reserves of \u0026pound18m to \u0026pound10m in three years - and North Ayrshire could run out of reserves in two or three years\u0026rsquo time.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos provisional outturn figures for 2017-18 and budget estimates for 2018-19 showed councils collectively spent \u0026pound126m of their general reserve last year.  This year it is expected to be \u0026pound113m, while in 2016-17 it was \u0026pound195m.  The budget for councils this year is around \u0026pound12bn, with reserves sitting at around \u0026pound1bn.  Although the headline figures in 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19 are offset by transfers in to reserves of around \u0026pound33m a year - half from oil-rich Shetland - the net drawd-owns of \u0026pound163m, \u0026pound93m and \u0026pound80m still represent percentage declines of 14, 8 and 7.5 per cent  The Scottish Tories said councils were being driven to \u0026ldquolast resort measures by SNP cuts, and claimed that on current trends all reserves would disappear within 14 years.  Tory MSP Alexander Stewart said: \u0026ldquoCouncils are increasingly dipping into their rainy day fund, and that\u0026rsquos a direct consequence of SNP budget cuts. It\u0026rsquos not like these reserves are being used for landmark projects, it\u0026rsquos a last resort to keep day-to-day services going.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not something that can continue \u0026ndash mathematically this option will disappear in little more than a decade if current trends continue.

Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.

The Aberdeenshire-based family firm is using the Royal Highland Show (RHS) to gather feedback and competitor analysis on its new milk chocolate recipe as well as comparing its real dairy ice cream with an oil-based major brand product.

Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director at Mackie’s, said: “This might well sound like an excuse for lots of fun – but we really do need a wide range of people to give us feedback on the taste of our products – that’s the most important attribute – and one that will inform what we go out to market with. “We always try to do something special for the RHS as it’s an integral part of the Mackie’s business, so we’re thrilled to be invited to participate on board the SRUC’s amazing new facility.“Hopefully the participants will enjoy getting a peek into the behind-the-scenes process of testing products before they are released on to the market.”Students at the college will be assisting with the sensory lab throughout the show, featuring a range of produce.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

It has recently appeared in the news as plans are made in Westminster for the UK\u0026#8217s departure from the European Union.Mr. Carmichael has said he will use his speech to call on the two sides to work to reach an agreement rather than \u0026#8220continue to squabble.\u0026#8221Speaking ahead of the debate, Mr. Carmichael said: “The Conservatives must accept that any shared framework cannot involve the UK Government simply dictating terms. It must be a shared process with joint buy-in, and the burden of proof is on them to build trust and show how this might work. There is, however, also a burden on the SNP to put aside their political posturing and find a deal that works for Scotland rather than storming off in a huff.“The people of Scotland deserve better than yet another battle over the constitution. They deserve Governments working for them.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
