Jordan now plays for England and Megan graduated universityWatching him in the stands in Russia last night was his doting girlfriend Megan Davison. University of Sunderland graduate Megan, 22, and Jordan have been dating since she was 14 and he was 16. They now live together in Cheshire’s ‘Golden Triangle’ between Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury, after Pickford signed for Everton.\u0027Instagram addict\u0027 Megan, now 22, often posts pictures of herself enjoying champagne and cocktails on beaches around the world, including the Bahamas.But Pickford has never forgotten his roots, according to Former Sunderland academy boss Kevin Ball.Ball recalled how Pickford ran to him as a child and asked for his autograph.           Former team mate George Honeyman remembered his former team mate fondly but said he always knew Jordan would go pro          Jordan Pickford known as \u0027Picky\u0027 with Wayne Rooney after signing for Everton and becoming Britain\u0027s most expensive goal keeper\u0027He asked for my autograph and a photo and said I was his favourite player,\u0027 remembers Ball, now a club ambassador.\u0027He showed me that picture years later and asked if I recognised who was in it. I said, Well, the handsome one is obviously me, and I\u0027m guessing that scrawny little kid is you?.\u0027Former team mate George Honeyman also praised Pickford who he says has always been confident. \u0027I played with him all the way through and he\u0027s always been such a fierce competitor,\u0027 he said.\u0027He had his mood swings if he didn\u0027t get his own way, but the main reason he has succeeded is how competitive and aggressive he is.\u0027Off the pitch, he\u0027s the life and soul, no-one dislikes him. Everyone says goalkeepers are mad, but he genuinely is, he\u0027s a nutter, in the nicest way.          Jordan Pickford in Russia: The player has been accompanied by his family (including his brother Richard, pictured) to his World Cup debut          Jordan Pickford\u0027s first call up was in 2016 and friend George Honeyman said looking back they knew he would go to the top\u0027He loves his boxing, motocross, golf, he\u0027s just a full-on, fun guy to be around.\u0027 And coach Ball remembers that well. Once, team mates overheard him telling Jordan he wouldn\u0027t make it with his attitude - to which the goalie replied \u0027I bet I will\u0027. Ball said: \u0027He thought he was the best. He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that. He challenged me.\u0027And, on the morning of his senior debut at Sunderland Pickford called his former coach, just to say thank you. Pickford is expected to start in England\u0027s game against Sweden on Saturday."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/10/4DE94FCD00000578-0-image-m-4_1530697639725.jpg","title":"Britains Got Talent contestant 76 shocked shop assistant pulling shirt aside","story":"The 23-year-old woman told magistrates that her \u0027stomach turned\u0027 when John Gough, 76, (pictured left, outside court, and right, on BGT last year) reached forward to touch her in full view of other customers and staff as he paid for petrol at the Gloucester storeShe could not continue working and she rang her mum and \u0027burst into tears\u0027 as she told her what had happened, she said.Mr Gough, of Gloucester, accepted that his actions amounted to a common assault but denied a charge of sexual assault on the woman on November 22 last year.Parents of two-month-old girl are charged with murder after...British lesbian wins the right to live with her partner in...Share this articleThe driving school boss, who holds records for economical long distance driving on minimal amounts of fuel, told the court he barely touched the woman and had no sexual motive behind his actions.He said he had simply been intrigued by the writing tattooed on her chest but could only see a few of the letters and thought they said \u0027red.\u0027          Record breaking driving instructor and Britain\u0027s Got Talent contestant John Gough gets into his car outside Cheltenham Magistrates courtCCTV of the incident was played to the court. It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester. He used only one gallon of unleaded petrol in his 850cc Perodua Nippa car up the M5 but to achieve the record had to go at only 35mph.Then in 2003 Mr Gough set another record by driving a Toyota Yaris 28 miles on just one litre of fuel."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/20/4DEC3B8F00000578-5918823-James_was_photographed_walking_along_the_deck_of_the_yacht_in_Po-a-80_1530731662068.jpg","title":"LeBron James family continue vacationing yacht Italy days Lakers deal","story":"    LeBron James is still vacationing in Italy with his family.

He said the final reading of economic growth for the first quarter (pictured far right), which was revised up from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent last week, confirmed his view of the UK\u0027s  positive trajectoryOutlining the success of the Bank\u0027s Brexit contingency measures, he said: \u0027By the first quarter of this year, UK GDP had increased by 1 percentage point less than the MPC had projected just prior to the referendum.\u0027This is despite the fact that Brexit has not happened yet and that UK financial conditions have remained supportive since the referendum, in contrast to previous periods of elevated uncertainty.\u0027This in part reflects the package of easing measures implemented by the MPC in August 2016 and less stringent fiscal policy as well as the resilient global environment.\u0027But turning directly to President Trump\u0027s actions, Mr Carney added: \u0027In a general trade war, it is unlikely that global financial conditions would prove as robust, or that monetary policy could be as supportive.\u0027 Economic models by the Bank of England show that a 10 percentage point rise in tariffs between the US and all of its trading partners could knock 2.5 per cent off US output and 1 per cent off global output.\u0027The hit to global and UK GDP (gross domestic product) would be substantially greater if everyone put up tariffs against everyone else,\u0027 the governor warned.

The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami.

If they can\u0027t afford to, though, or they drive a company car, then it starts to become a problem for them.\u0027I think a lot of men feel emasculated by a woman in a powerful position, whether that\u0027s in the boardroom or behind the wheel of a car.\u0027I don\u0027t rise to the comments I get when I\u0027m out driving. I generally reply with a witty putdown to make it clear I\u0027m not just a WAG in a shiny car with no clue how to drive it.\u0027          Company boss Maya Hartge is used to attracting attention when she\u0027s driving her Porsche 981 Spyder convertibleWhile the idea that a man might find it hard to cope with a woman driving a fancy car may sound dated, according to John Groeger, Professor of Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who has a particular interest in motoring, what Maya experiences is a common reaction.Even in 2018, some men find it hard to cope with the idea that many women are now big earners — and savers — and can splash out on whatever car takes their fancy.\u0027One of the things we\u0027ve noticed in our research is that people will get angry and behave aggressively towards drivers they believe are of a lower status than themselves,\u0027 says Professor Groeger.\u0027Sexism is still rife in all areas of life — and there\u0027s plenty of it lurking in the traffic system, too. We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/12/4DF238A600000578-0-image-m-39_1530789105836.jpg","title":"Can spot venomous snake hiding grass","story":"    A keen eye might be able to pick out the red-bellied black snake hiding in this photoAlmost 60 people had a go at spotting the snake, with only a couple being able to correctly identify the lurking predator. One Facebook commenter made their guess, saying, \u0027Stripy looking long thing!

Travel, Rory Boland, said: ‘Not all customers are comfortable booking online, and they should not be penalised for booking over the phone. Airlines that are charging customers more must be clear and transparent about these additional fees.’Both BA and Tui said the charge represented the extra administration and staff costs involved in offering telephone bookings, while Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of its customers book over the phone.Easyjet said: ‘We encourage passengers to book online. Those using our telephone service are informed of the online discount at the beginning of the call’.It also said that passengers needing special assistance can still receive the online price by phone. The mark-up comes on top of other charges applied by airlines such as passengers being be charged up to £16 to pick their seat. People who choose to put a suitcase in the hold can pay up to £38 for something under 20kg, while going over the weight allowance by the equivalent of a bag of sugar can trigger a £12 charge.          Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of their customers book over the telephoneAt least one airline now even charges customers a fee of £1.75 each way to take hand luggage into the cabin.A separate survey on airline fees by holiday currency experts FairFX found flight costs can soar once all the add-ons are taken into account.A spokesman said: ‘While many airlines will assign you a seat for free for your journey, if you are travelling with family, young children, friends or a partner, the only way to guarantee you will be sat next to each other is to pay the additional fee to reserve a seat.’FairFX said with each airline imposing its own costs and rules on putting luggage into the hold, it has become both confusing and expensive. For example, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook have a 20kg limit per bag, but the fees vary from £23 to £38. BA, EasyJet and Flybe have a higher 23kg limit and the fees range from £20 to £31. The limit at Jet2 is 22kg and there is a charge of £22.Most short-haul travellers have switched to taking only hand luggage to avoid these fees, but even this is no longer guaranteed to be free. Last summer Jet2 introduced ‘guaranteed cabin luggage’, charging passengers £1.75 each if they want to guarantee their hand luggage does not end up in the hold.FairFX chief Ian Strafford-Taylor said booking holidays has become a ‘financial minefield for families’ and warned them to be aware of the different add-ons, which could soon see the cost of their holidays ‘rocket’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/23/4DF21DB000000578-0-image-m-13_1530831158414.jpg","title":"One seven GP posts vacancy rates three times six years","story":"    One in seven GP posts is empty, with vacancy rates up three-fold in six years, figures revealBut the record shortages are leaving patients with ever-longer waiting times, and make it far more difficult to see the same GP each time.An annual survey of family doctors by Pulse magazine shows the vacancy rate is now at 15.3 per cent – its highest so far.

The shortage has come about because older doctors are choosing to retire in their 50s as they are fed up with the increasingly intense workloads and form-filling.At the same time millennial GPs are opting to only work part-time or practise as locums, rather than holding down permanent posts.Some of these GPs have families, while others want to mix their time up with research, starting up a business or private work.Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘The fact that so many surgeries are unable to recruit GPs provides yet more evidence of the scale of the crisis impacting general practice.           Heavy workloads are seeing senior doctors take early retirement, while their younger colleagues are opting to work part-timeThe Government must prioritise general practice and urgently invest in it to address this growing crisis ... We cannot allow a situation where patient safety is being compromised by a lack of political action.’ The survey asked GPs how many posts were vacant in their own surgery. From these figures, Pulse estimated the total number of vacancies nationally.Several family doctors said their surgery was increasingly relying on nurses, paramedics or pharmacists – or so-called ‘multi-disciplinary teams.’One GP, who did not want to be named, said: ‘This provides appointments but means that inidual GP list sizes have risen substantially. Results, letters, paperwork, prescribing requests and admin workload all go to the named GP, so high list sizes bring high workload and responsibility.’The Department of Health and Social Care said: ‘We are increasing investment by £2.4billion a year by 2020 and more than 3,000 GPs are expected to be recruited into training this year.

It is a situation that is replicated up and down the country, and business rates are playing a major part in deepening the problem.As the Daily Mail’s important and timely Save Our High Streets campaign has highlighted, nearly 6,000 shops went bust last year and 50,000 retail jobs were lost. Outlets from small shops to major chains are closing with terrifying regularity.Nobody is arguing that businesses shouldn’t pay tax. Only that taxes should be fair. And the British Retail Consortium has shown how the retail sector is stumping up more than its share – it pays 10 per cent of all business taxes while accounting for only 5 per cent of the UK economy’s GVA (Greater Value Added), the primary measure used by the Office of National Statistics to gauge economic productivity.By international standards, UK businesses also pay higher taxes on property than in almost any other country.The strain this is putting on businesses is immense and unjust. As a Conservative, I understand instinctively that my party should be on the side of enterprise.We need to do better, and this means the Chancellor has to up his game. Too often since his appointment, he has shown a tin ear to the concerns of precisely the sorts of people the Conservative Party ought to be championing. A tidal wave of avoidable business closures due to an unwillingness to change course on business rates must not be added to that list of failings.Nigel Farage vows he WILL return to frontline politics if...Share this articleThe Government’s position is that it has delivered help to struggling high street businesses in the form of billions of pounds’ worth of business rate relief.But this is a case of trying to apply a sticking plaster to an ever-widening wound: the British Retail Consortium estimates that retailers will pay an additional £2billion over the next three years compared to the previous three.The system itself is broken, and no amount of rate relief can get round that. We need to look at a wholly new system, probably based around the value of product sales rather than property, which would level the playing field between businesses which have a physical presence in our high streets and those operating online.While this new system is designed and consulted on, we should give the high street breathing space by adopting the BRC’s proposal for a two-year freeze in rates increases. As a member of the Treasury select committee, I am anxious that in the meantime we should contribute to that consultation process.Practical steps like this to back business are the right answer to the high street’s woes. Only if we sort out business rates can we distinguish between those businesses that fail because they no longer meet a market need and potentially good businesses which are being taken to the wall because of the current unfair tax regime.Take one of my constituents, Shobu Barua, the owner of a popular new Thai restaurant, Coco \u0026amp Rum, in the seaside resort of Saltburn. He recently took the plunge and moved into a vacant shop in the heart of the town.Immediately, he was hit by a wickedly high business rates bill, which I am working with him to try to reduce. Shobu warns that he may have to close unless the bill comes down.What kind of message are we sending to hard-working people like Shobu who want to invest in their business, take on staff and contribute to the economy?The Chancellor has a duty to listen, and to act. If he gets this right, he will be remembered as a Chancellor who saved the high street. If he fails to act, he risks being remembered as the man who betrayed it.Simon Clarke, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and a member of the Commons Treasury select committee  The Mail visited Philip Hammond’s constituency yesterday to see what they thought of the Chancellor’s attitude towards small businesses.In Weybridge, Surrey, where Mr Hammond was voted into office in May 1997, local businesses laid bare the daily struggle they face and hit out at their MP over his lack of help.LIVELIHOOD AT STAKE Sue Bridger, 59, has run cafe French Fancy’s with daughter Tashana French after they built it from scratch three years ago.But spiralling costs are already threatening to put them out of business like so many before them.Mrs Bridger, who has lived in Weybridge for around 20 years, says the high street is a shadow of its former self. ‘It used to be a busy town,’ she said. ‘There were shops for the rich and shops for the poor. Now the wealthy just get in their taxis to Kensington to do their shopping. People have been coming in here asking me where all the shops have gone.’Incredibly, Mrs Bridger wasn’t aware that Mr Hammond – the man with the power to save the high street – is her MP. ‘I never see him around. If he did come down perhaps he would realise what a mess the place is,’ she said.  Inci Malik (left) says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas while Jay Patel has faced crippling business rate increases at her newsagents Business rates on her shop have risen from £10,000 to £11,500 since April, having already increased from £9,000 in 2016. ‘Independent shops are community institutions,’ she said. ‘I like the fact that an 80-year-old grandmother can come in for some company as well as a coffee. If we had to close, that is what I would miss the most.‘This is our livelihood at stake.’Meanwhile, Inci Malik says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas.Her business rates have soared year-on-year, increasing from £13,329 to £14,478 for 2017-2018 after they started at £11,000 when she moved to the town in 2015. The rateable value of the property has risen from £24,000 to £32,750 in that time.Business rates are now equivalent to 6 per cent of her turnover.The 42-year-old said: ‘It is inevitable that we will go out of business if this keeps up. Last year I had to lay off four of my full-time staff. It was upsetting to do. I am now working seven days a week.’Miss Malik urged the Chancellor to stop increasing rates for small shops and focus on ending tax avoidance by large corporations.She said: ‘There’s a Starbucks next door – it’s unfair they get an easy ride, when people like us who are part of the community get hit.’HE DOESN\u0027T CARE RAJ Patel said Mr Hammond was not interested in the plight of small businesses in his constituency.Mr Patel, who owns Weybridge News, said he was ‘unsurprised’ by his MP’s ‘negative’ attitude.‘I had a meeting with him about four years ago,’ he said. ‘He didn’t seem to be very clued up about our situation, nor did he seem particularly interested.‘Most of the time he is here, he is just hanging around outside Waitrose in the run-up to an election.’The 48-year-old, who has run the newsagents with his 46-year-old wife Jay for a decade, said he has faced crippling business rate increases.          Spiralling costs are already threatening to put Tashana French out of business‘These rates are unfair when you compare them to shops that are not on the high street,’ he said. ‘Some of those are much bigger than ours, but they don’t have to pay anywhere near as much.’He said fewer customers and business closures had created a vicious cycle of decline.‘A lot have already moved out, which has been bad for us because not as many people come to the town any more.‘It has been in steady decline. It is becoming a bit of a ghost town.’WE\u0027LL CUT STAFF HUSBAND and wife Ali and Elena Vahedi say rocketing rates will force them to cut staff at their Italian restaurant.Their restaurant Osso Buco has been hit with a 67 per cent increase in its rateable value, from £44,500 to £74,000.Since April last year, they have had to find an extra £3,500 a year after their annual business rates increased to £25,683 from about £22,000.Mr Vahedi, who has owned the restaurant for seven years, said they will have no choice but to cut jobs and that business rates threatened to ‘destroy’ the high street.He said: ‘It will be a big problem, the Government and the council are squeezing us from every angle.‘We can’t cut wages and we can’t put prices up or we will lose customers. So the only way we can get that extra money is to employ less staff and cut jobs.’The 52-year-old added: ‘It shows the Government are out of touch. They don’t seem to understand every penny counts, even a 1 per cent rise has a huge effect.’Mr Vahedi called on Mr Hammond to do more to protect small businesses in his constituency.‘We are looking at a future when there will not be a single independent business left in Weybridge,’ he warned.LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN EVE Moreve, who owns a women’s fashion store, said soaring rates could be the ‘final nail in the coffin’ for independent shops in the town. The rateable value of Mrs Moreve’s shop, Ben Vestito, has increased from £11,250 to £15,750, taking it above the business rates threshold and meaning she will have to start paying annual rates of £5,831.‘It’s ridiculous,’ she said. ‘High streets everywhere are dying as it is and for many shops this will be the final nail in the coffin.‘I don’t think Philip Hammond has any interest in his local constituency. It seems like the Government want every small business to close.‘Everything they do is geared towards helping big businesses. It’s just wrong. It doesn’t make any sense.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/01/4DF70E2900000578-5923747-image-a-2_1530837574775.jpg","title":"Footie Alfresco Englands crunch World Cup match Saturday","story":"    Is it a television or piece of art? - £14,995  Even the kids can\u0027t break this monster - £9,600 DuraScreen 65in Outdoor TV, £9,600, proofvision.co.ukBEST FOR: Overexcited crowds.WEIGHT: 85kg.WHAT: With screens five times brighter than those of boring old indoor tellies, these sturdy screens are suitable for viewing on the brightest of days, with added anti-reflection technology so you don’ t need to watch the neighbours cat stalking birds in the background of the World Cup action. They can withstand extreme heat and cold (the latter usually being more appropriate in UK climes).

We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/12/4DF238A600000578-0-image-m-39_1530789105836.jpg","title":"Can spot venomous snake hiding grass","story":"    A keen eye might be able to pick out the red-bellied black snake hiding in this photoAlmost 60 people had a go at spotting the snake, with only a couple being able to correctly identify the lurking predator. One Facebook commenter made their guess, saying, \u0027Stripy looking long thing!

Travel, Rory Boland, said: ‘Not all customers are comfortable booking online, and they should not be penalised for booking over the phone. Airlines that are charging customers more must be clear and transparent about these additional fees.’Both BA and Tui said the charge represented the extra administration and staff costs involved in offering telephone bookings, while Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of its customers book over the phone.Easyjet said: ‘We encourage passengers to book online. Those using our telephone service are informed of the online discount at the beginning of the call’.It also said that passengers needing special assistance can still receive the online price by phone. The mark-up comes on top of other charges applied by airlines such as passengers being be charged up to £16 to pick their seat.

For example, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook have a 20kg limit per bag, but the fees vary from £23 to £38. BA, EasyJet and Flybe have a higher 23kg limit and the fees range from £20 to £31.

It is a situation that is replicated up and down the country, and business rates are playing a major part in deepening the problem.As the Daily Mail’s important and timely Save Our High Streets campaign has highlighted, nearly 6,000 shops went bust last year and 50,000 retail jobs were lost. Outlets from small shops to major chains are closing with terrifying regularity.Nobody is arguing that businesses shouldn’t pay tax. Only that taxes should be fair. And the British Retail Consortium has shown how the retail sector is stumping up more than its share – it pays 10 per cent of all business taxes while accounting for only 5 per cent of the UK economy’s GVA (Greater Value Added), the primary measure used by the Office of National Statistics to gauge economic productivity.By international standards, UK businesses also pay higher taxes on property than in almost any other country.The strain this is putting on businesses is immense and unjust. As a Conservative, I understand instinctively that my party should be on the side of enterprise.We need to do better, and this means the Chancellor has to up his game. Too often since his appointment, he has shown a tin ear to the concerns of precisely the sorts of people the Conservative Party ought to be championing. A tidal wave of avoidable business closures due to an unwillingness to change course on business rates must not be added to that list of failings.Nigel Farage vows he WILL return to frontline politics if...Share this articleThe Government’s position is that it has delivered help to struggling high street businesses in the form of billions of pounds’ worth of business rate relief.But this is a case of trying to apply a sticking plaster to an ever-widening wound: the British Retail Consortium estimates that retailers will pay an additional £2billion over the next three years compared to the previous three.The system itself is broken, and no amount of rate relief can get round that. We need to look at a wholly new system, probably based around the value of product sales rather than property, which would level the playing field between businesses which have a physical presence in our high streets and those operating online.While this new system is designed and consulted on, we should give the high street breathing space by adopting the BRC’s proposal for a two-year freeze in rates increases. As a member of the Treasury select committee, I am anxious that in the meantime we should contribute to that consultation process.Practical steps like this to back business are the right answer to the high street’s woes. Only if we sort out business rates can we distinguish between those businesses that fail because they no longer meet a market need and potentially good businesses which are being taken to the wall because of the current unfair tax regime.Take one of my constituents, Shobu Barua, the owner of a popular new Thai restaurant, Coco \u0026amp Rum, in the seaside resort of Saltburn. He recently took the plunge and moved into a vacant shop in the heart of the town.Immediately, he was hit by a wickedly high business rates bill, which I am working with him to try to reduce. Shobu warns that he may have to close unless the bill comes down.What kind of message are we sending to hard-working people like Shobu who want to invest in their business, take on staff and contribute to the economy?The Chancellor has a duty to listen, and to act. If he gets this right, he will be remembered as a Chancellor who saved the high street. If he fails to act, he risks being remembered as the man who betrayed it.Simon Clarke, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and a member of the Commons Treasury select committee  The Mail visited Philip Hammond’s constituency yesterday to see what they thought of the Chancellor’s attitude towards small businesses.In Weybridge, Surrey, where Mr Hammond was voted into office in May 1997, local businesses laid bare the daily struggle they face and hit out at their MP over his lack of help.LIVELIHOOD AT STAKE Sue Bridger, 59, has run cafe French Fancy’s with daughter Tashana French after they built it from scratch three years ago.But spiralling costs are already threatening to put them out of business like so many before them.Mrs Bridger, who has lived in Weybridge for around 20 years, says the high street is a shadow of its former self. ‘It used to be a busy town,’ she said. ‘There were shops for the rich and shops for the poor. Now the wealthy just get in their taxis to Kensington to do their shopping. People have been coming in here asking me where all the shops have gone.’Incredibly, Mrs Bridger wasn’t aware that Mr Hammond – the man with the power to save the high street – is her MP. ‘I never see him around. If he did come down perhaps he would realise what a mess the place is,’ she said.  Inci Malik (left) says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas while Jay Patel has faced crippling business rate increases at her newsagents Business rates on her shop have risen from £10,000 to £11,500 since April, having already increased from £9,000 in 2016. ‘Independent shops are community institutions,’ she said. ‘I like the fact that an 80-year-old grandmother can come in for some company as well as a coffee. If we had to close, that is what I would miss the most.‘This is our livelihood at stake.’Meanwhile, Inci Malik says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas.Her business rates have soared year-on-year, increasing from £13,329 to £14,478 for 2017-2018 after they started at £11,000 when she moved to the town in 2015. The rateable value of the property has risen from £24,000 to £32,750 in that time.Business rates are now equivalent to 6 per cent of her turnover.The 42-year-old said: ‘It is inevitable that we will go out of business if this keeps up. Last year I had to lay off four of my full-time staff. It was upsetting to do. I am now working seven days a week.’Miss Malik urged the Chancellor to stop increasing rates for small shops and focus on ending tax avoidance by large corporations.She said: ‘There’s a Starbucks next door – it’s unfair they get an easy ride, when people like us who are part of the community get hit.’HE DOESN\u0027T CARE RAJ Patel said Mr Hammond was not interested in the plight of small businesses in his constituency.Mr Patel, who owns Weybridge News, said he was ‘unsurprised’ by his MP’s ‘negative’ attitude.‘I had a meeting with him about four years ago,’ he said. ‘He didn’t seem to be very clued up about our situation, nor did he seem particularly interested.‘Most of the time he is here, he is just hanging around outside Waitrose in the run-up to an election.’The 48-year-old, who has run the newsagents with his 46-year-old wife Jay for a decade, said he has faced crippling business rate increases.          Spiralling costs are already threatening to put Tashana French out of business‘These rates are unfair when you compare them to shops that are not on the high street,’ he said. ‘Some of those are much bigger than ours, but they don’t have to pay anywhere near as much.’He said fewer customers and business closures had created a vicious cycle of decline.‘A lot have already moved out, which has been bad for us because not as many people come to the town any more.‘It has been in steady decline. It is becoming a bit of a ghost town.’WE\u0027LL CUT STAFF HUSBAND and wife Ali and Elena Vahedi say rocketing rates will force them to cut staff at their Italian restaurant.Their restaurant Osso Buco has been hit with a 67 per cent increase in its rateable value, from £44,500 to £74,000.Since April last year, they have had to find an extra £3,500 a year after their annual business rates increased to £25,683 from about £22,000.Mr Vahedi, who has owned the restaurant for seven years, said they will have no choice but to cut jobs and that business rates threatened to ‘destroy’ the high street.He said: ‘It will be a big problem, the Government and the council are squeezing us from every angle.‘We can’t cut wages and we can’t put prices up or we will lose customers. So the only way we can get that extra money is to employ less staff and cut jobs.’The 52-year-old added: ‘It shows the Government are out of touch. They don’t seem to understand every penny counts, even a 1 per cent rise has a huge effect.’Mr Vahedi called on Mr Hammond to do more to protect small businesses in his constituency.‘We are looking at a future when there will not be a single independent business left in Weybridge,’ he warned.LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN EVE Moreve, who owns a women’s fashion store, said soaring rates could be the ‘final nail in the coffin’ for independent shops in the town. The rateable value of Mrs Moreve’s shop, Ben Vestito, has increased from £11,250 to £15,750, taking it above the business rates threshold and meaning she will have to start paying annual rates of £5,831.‘It’s ridiculous,’ she said. ‘High streets everywhere are dying as it is and for many shops this will be the final nail in the coffin.‘I don’t think Philip Hammond has any interest in his local constituency. It seems like the Government want every small business to close.‘Everything they do is geared towards helping big businesses. It’s just wrong. It doesn’t make any sense.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30645969604931fbb83e5da5e0898a92803ca35e/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e50a9d31ea310f76bb7fbd861db2821d 1760w","title":"the guardian view on islamophobia time for the tories to act","story":"Institutions can promise to tackle their problems because they grasp that there really is a problem. Or they can promise to do so because they begin to discern – often very tardily – that others, including their own members and supporters, believe there is a problem. On the surface, at least, the difference between these approaches cannot always be easily defined. Yet people usually have a gut sense of which has been adopted. They also know which will lead to real solutions.Sayeeda Warsi, formerly the chair of the Conservative party, has demanded that it launch a full and independent inquiry into Islamophobia (or, as she put it, a “fuck the Muslims” tendency) within the party, echoing a call from the Muslim Council of Britain. Lady Warsi, the MCB and other critics point to cases including the Conservative councillor suspended after sharing an article calling Muslims “parasites” and Tory MP Bob Blackman, who retweeted a message from the founder of the English Defence League (by mistake, he says) and was a member of an Islamophobic Facebook group (to which he says he was added without his knowledge). Most damaging of all – because it was a matter of party strategy, not just the action or words of an inidual – was the London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith, which sought to tar Sadiq Khan as an extremist, and the subsequent attempts to justify those tactics.Writing for the , Lady Warsi acknowledged that her party has begun to strike a new note, stressing the unacceptability of abuse and discrimination. But she rightly described its plan for tackling the issue as woefully inept the obvious problem with voluntary ersity training is that those most likely to offend are unlikely to take part.If Conservatives think they can brush such issues aside, they should only look to the continuing storm over antisemitism within Labour. On Thursday, its national executive committee adopted a new code of conduct, using the widely accepted definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance but not all of the accompanying examples, fuelling the controversy rather than laying it to rest.To paraphrase the Chakrabarti report on antisemitism in Labour, the Tory party is not overrun by Islamophobia. Nor is Islamophobia unique to Conservatives, any more than antisemitism is unique\u0026nbspto the left. And there is no doubt that accusations of bigotry and discrimination can be “weaponised” for political purposes, often hypocritically. But the exploitation of grievances for political purposes does not mean that those grievances are unfounded. When representatives of a minority group warn that there is a problem, the institution involved should pay real attention. The self-interested motive is protecting its reputation and support. The greater one is recognising how quickly such poison can spread if not checked. A superficial reckoning will not satisfy critics more importantly, it\u0026nbspwill not solve the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1cd3942433c2bb9fa1e11df95e8e38dc3669586/0_75_4134_2479/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=254aed58be05077f5fecbbcecd44d9f7","title":"the guardian view on the chequers brexit summit putting party before country","story":"It is important to see Friday’s cabinet meeting at Chequers about Brexit policy for what it is and for what it is not. The meeting is highly significant. But it is significant not because it may set a sensible national policy towards the EU after Brexit. It is significant because it may finally settle the Conservative party’s internal argument about Brexit terms. There is a huge gulf between the two.Ever since the vote to leave, Britain’s stance on future relations with the EU has been disabled by isions within the Tory party. These prevent the UK from presenting a settled view on future economic, regulatory and security relations with the EU27. This internal argument now threatens to run up against the deadlines of the withdrawal process. An outline deal must be agreed by the autumn if the UK is to begin an orderly transition to a new relationship with the EU in March 2019. But that cannot happen as long as the government is at war about what that relationship should look like.Almost all Tory MPs accept the 2016 result as a given, so this is not an argument about whether Brexit should go ahead or not. However, Theresa May and most Conservative MPs and ministers want Britain to remain workably convergent with EU rules. They want this for two reasons: because it is best for jobs and the economy and because it helps guarantee cross-border arrangements in the Northern Ireland peace process. A minority of ministers and MPs don’t agree. They don’t care a fig about either Northern Ireland or Europe. They also believe, as faith and dogma, that there should be as few rules as possible covering Britain’s relations with the EU. Their view was succinctly expressed by Boris Johnson’s curt dismissal of business concerns.Mrs May’s objective at Chequers is to unite her ministers around a Brexit strategy that delivers the break with the EU that Tory leavers want on terms that Tory remainers can live with. Those terms centre on maintaining the frictionless border in Ireland in a cooperative customs arrangement designed by Downing Street (crucial for keeping our word on the Good Friday agreement), maintaining single market access on manufactured goods and food, and buying access to the EU services market (crucial for business and for the chancellor, Philip Hammond).Ministers finally received a draft of these terms on Thursday, after much haggling with and inside No 10. Early word was that the increasingly alienated Brexit secretary, David Davis, does not want them. It is hard to see how the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, can do so either, since the harmonisation proposed by Mrs May effectively means his coveted (and undesirable) bilateral trade deal with the US would be still-born. The key issue at Chequers is nevertheless whether the most committed leavers, including Mr Davis and Mr Fox, can accept these terms or something like them.Where is the national, as opposed to the party, interest here? The answer is that it is nowhere to be found. The national interest will not be protected in the terms that emerge at Chequers. It is true that it will be less bad if Mrs May carries the day. But that is only because the alternative, continuing disabling Tory isions over Brexit, perhaps leading to a no-deal exit in March, would be even worse. In reality,\u0026nbspeven Mrs May’s version could be highly damaging to jobs, the economy, business and public services, and could mean new uncertainties in Ireland, even if it were all to be agreed by the EU. That\u0026nbspwould not be a soft Brexit at all.This is the heart of the Chequers disjunction. A deal within the Tory party does not mean a deal with the EU. Mrs May wants that, of course – she was in Berlin on Thursday seeking German support. But the complex bespoke arrangements that ministers are discussing at Chequers are a last minute cobble-up. They smack of desperation. So much time has been wasted that one of the least worst options now could be to park the UK’s future relationship with the EU in an EEA deal – known as “Norway for now” in the trade – while ministers hammer out the strategic approach that has been so lacking for the last two years. In a better government than this, that would have been the focus of cabinet meetings many months ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9678f0b37832d9fd8185e79fd20be82b08036b7c/936_194_2381_1429/master/2381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1783b4828dbdc910a2db228847b0a3ce","title":"waistcoats amazing gareth southgate","story":"I have mixed feelings about this.

It’s quite clever how they do this, considering that they’re meant to be tight around the torso. But they are forgiving because – and here’s the clever bit – you can either have them done up, or undone.The tradition of leaving the bottom button undone is said to have been started in emulation of Edward VII, who was too fat to do them all up. The England manager, Gareth Southgate, doesn’t do this, and this is important, because the waistcoat has an astonishing ability to both underline and erase class distinctions.The garment may belong to the three-piece suits of the elite, and the fancy uniforms of Etonians (that ultra-smarmy set within a set of Etonians known as “Pop” are allowed considerable latitude in the design of their waistcoats, and they strut like peacocks in them), but they also belong to the working class, to snooker players, honky-tonk piano players, and cowboys. Just as they operate in a liminal space between the shirt and the jacket, so they exist in an ambivalent place between classes. (Yes, I know this will get me into Pseuds Corner in Private Eye, but it doesn’t mean what I have said is actually untrue.)Wearing a waistcoat without a jacket is, of course, the best way to wear one. It signifies that one is at work, but also that one is ready to roll up one’s sleeves to get that work done. It frames the body nicely, and is probably the only item of male clothing that objectifies the body in such a way as to make it alluring. (Of course, this depends on the body, but still.) And even better, it has pockets. All the pockets a jacket has, but without the sleeves, which get grubby, wrinkled, frayed. A waistcoat, well looked after, will see the rest of its suit – if it came with a suit – to the grave.My own waistcoat, brought back by a girlfriend from a trip to Nepal (after she’d asked me if I wanted anything from there) didn’t come from a suit. It is my single most indispensable item of clothing, and not just because of the person who gave it to me. And now that Southgate has brought them into the limelight, my foresight and excellent taste have been vindicated. The only snag is that now anyone who sees me in it will think it’s because of him.• Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da56cde11daaa3d3ab31eb06c10697a9c9d0e2c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4076d10e474063e688ef04756f002732","title":"worst epa administrator scott pruitt","story":"The notorious climate denier finally resigned amid scandal. Don’t trust Trump to replace him with someone who actually cares about the environmentScott Pruitt has been cruelly misunderstood. Now that he has quit as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, it’s time to set the record straight. You see, he wasn’t just protecting the environment. He was protecting our president’s soul.“My desire in service to you has always been to bless you as you make important decisions for the American people,” Pruitt wrote to Trump as he shuffled off this mortal coil of government. “I believe you are serving as President today because of God’s providence. I believe that same providence brought me into your service.”You can believe in the science of climate change if you like. Scott Pruitt believes he is a saint, which you can clearly see from his many martyrdoms.For starters, he wasn’t asking his security detail to drive around looking for Ritz-Carlton moisturizing lotion for the sake of his complexion. People outside the EPA have no idea just how much rising temperatures can dry out a cabinet official’s skin. Think of it more like a federal exploration of how climate change affects the epidermis of the executive branch.Speaking of hotels, what kind of malice does it take to suggest that his desperate need for a used mattress from a Trump hotel was some kind of prima donna exercise in sucking up to his boss? You don’t need to have a Harvard medical degree to know that a good night’s sleep might be all that separates us from a newly negotiated Paris climate deal.Yes, of course people have gossiped endlessly about our tireless protector of the environment seeking out a meeting with the CEO of Chick-fil-A to scope out a job for his wife. But honestly, their chicken is rather delicious, even if their politics are not. Besides, how are you going to sell environmental protection to Trump Country without a huge supply of fried food?Some people have sounded shocked that Pruitt would want cut-price accommodation from a Washington lobbyist, or get his young staffers to pay his hotel bills without reimbursing them.But in a cabinet stacked full of super-wealthy Mnuchins and Cohns and Rosses – never mind the less-wealthy Trumps – Pruitt was just a poor boy making good. All those camels couldn’t pass through the eye of a needle like a man who spends lobbyist and staffer money.The founding myth of Trumpland is a tale about the superpowers of the Grand Wizard who survived the black magic of the FBI, the plague of fake news, the video horrors of Billy Bush, and of course the email sorceress known as Hillary. On his way to draining the swamp, our very stable genius wizard has slayed a few dragons called Comey and Truth, but also waved his wand over ugly frogs called Vladimir and Kim.For many moons, our wizard warded off evil by keeping Saint Scott inside the bubble of his benevolent spells. Just last month, he used his protective cloak to single Scott out for special treatment. “EPA is doing really, really well,” he said. “Somebody has to say that about you a little bit. You know that, Scott.”The wizard’s minions told us how he was protecting not just Scott’s front, but also his rear. “We’ve got your back,” was the message, curiously told to the evil media who delighted so much in punishing the protector of the environment. “Keep your head up,” the wizard said.So what does it say about the wizard’s strength now that Saint Scott is gone? If Trump magic can’t protect someone saving our president’s soul through the power of providence, then who is safe in Trumpland?First a Bannon, then a Scaramucci. You fire an Omarosa, then you lose all Hope. You reject a Rex but you can’t get your Gorka back in the bottle.It’s almost like there’s some invisible hand steering this bizarre sequence of hirings and firings, but we can’t figure out what the hand is trying to do. Or if it’s a left or right hand. Or if either hand knows they are connected through the same torso.It is somewhat easier to discern a pattern in Trump’s attitude towards the planet. The real scandal of the Pruitt era was not the personal corruption – not the millions spent on personal security or the thousands spent on a soundproof phone booth. No, the enduring scar left by Scott Pruitt is the political dismantling of the EPA itself. In year one, he rolled back regulations protecting clean water. He scrubbed away references to climate change and stopped collecting data on methane emissions. He blocked regulations designed to cut emissions from cars and power plants.And don’t expect the scar to disappear any time soon. EPA administrators come and go, but Trump cares for the environment the way a logger cares for the rainforest. Pruitt’s deputy is Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who used to be chief of staff to James Inhofe, the Republican senator for Oklahoma, perhaps the loudest and dumbest climate denier on Capitol Hill. Wheeler is the kind of fossil fuel guy who enjoys The Onion’s parody of him as a pulsating black sludge. Making America Great Again does not extend to the land, water and air we know as America.Wheeler will now serve as the acting administrator, and likely successor to Saint Scott, in much the same way as a fox looks after a henhouse. As if by magic, the fossil fuel industry has taken over the agency that was supposed to protect our environment from the worst effects of that industry. But their new man is enough of a Washington insider to avoid the personal scandals that brought down his old boss.So farewell, Saint Scott. You were the Worst. EPA administrator. Ever.May you feast on Chick-fil-A in what’s left of the pastures that lobbyists have handed you. And may providence protect whatever survives your EPA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8dbe3e0461ea081782aef8f26b39b85f296085/0_0_650_394/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=176c5fd92cafe46e3b6fb2c734cd4310 1880w","title":"the top 20 tom cruise movies ranked","story":"As the actor returns with Mission: Impossible – Fallout, we rank his 20 best films, from 1983’s The Outsiders to 2008’s Tropic ThunderIt was a toss-up between this and Vanilla Sky for the 20th spot, and Far and Away just nudged it because it is – admittedly not intentionally – hilarious, while the latter is a mega downer. No movie accent will ever give me as much joy as Cruise’s Irish accent.Not a disaster, but nowhere near as good as a Spielberg-Cruise adaptation of HG Wells’ tale should have been. Cruise, deep into his publicly eccentric years, plays a orced dad just trying to do right by his kids while fighting alien invaders, but comes across more alien than the invaders.This film was supposed to be exciting because we kinda, sorta, maybe got to see Cruise and his then wife, Nicole Kidman, have sex, but a major flaw in that sales pitch is no one wanted to. Including, it turned out, them. Their marriage fell apart soon after the making of this film and some of us are still unconvinced it was worth the marriage.It’s Top Gun – in a car. And nowhere near as good. This film is best known as the one in which Cruise and Kidman met. But it should be celebrated for giving Cruise’s character the name of Cole Trickle. For not laughing hysterically every time they say his name, everyone in this film deserves an Oscar.No one watches this movie now. But they should. Babyfaced and clearly vertically challenged, Cruise plays the most unlikely American football player ever committed to film, but even in the early days of his career, his charisma was undeniable. Unexpectedly gritty and with lovely support from Craig T Nelson.Gosh, who should we get to play the young lawyer, full of morals and ambition, who suddenly finds himself in a bad world filled with bad men? John Grisham may not have written the part with Cruise in mind, but whichever Thetan Cruise worships made him for thismovie.Eat me, haterz: people who criticise this film have no sense of fun. Cruise is enjoyably weird as Lestat de Lioncourt, the ultimate vampire. The real problem with this movie is Brad Pitt, who takes it all way too seriously. Cruise understands this is not a drama – it’s a camp delight.Frankly, if you don’t enjoy the sight of Cruise slinging rum cocktails on a beach to a Beach Boys soundtrack, then please march yourself to a doctor immediately because you have lost your soul.Grizzled Paul Newman, rehashing his role from The Hustler, hands the matinee idol baton here to a young and twinkly-eyed Cruise. It is hard not to die a little inside when you look at Cruise’s pretty face and think of the weird life choices he would go on to make a babe heading off into the dark woods.A bit of a cheat this, yes, as Cruise is barely in the movie. But, his performance as the deranged studio executive Les Grossman was so good it saved his career after all the sofa jumping and Scientology bullshittery. Some of us have never really recovered from the sight of a bald Cruise grooving to Flo Rida.Probably not a movie that Cruise kicks back and watches in his spare time, given that his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, is now dating his co-star, Jamie Foxx. Still, that shouldn’t distract the rest of us from enjoying Cruise playing memorably against type as a killer and Foxx as the cabby he hires for the evening. It does distract a little, mind.Hear me out: Cruise should have got the Oscar for this instead of Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman’s performance is all tricks and tics, but Cruise, as the obnoxious jerk who learns he has a brother, is subtle and true. Setting the pattern for his career, Cruise was underrated because he made it look effortless.Cruise and Spielberg should, by rights, be as natural a combination as bread and butter, and yet Minority Report is the only truly satisfying movie they have made together. Playing a working-class teenager in Oklahoma alongside then fellow near-unknowns Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane and Matt Dillon (someone give that casting director a medal), Cruise his a small but pleasing role in this, the most beautiful of all 80s teen movies.Cameron Crowe wrote this role of the beaten-down sports agent for the other Tom – Hanks – and the movie probably would have made more sense with him: Cruise is just too good-looking to be a credible underdog. But, he seizes the part with irresistible intensity, making even the naffest of Crowe’s lines sound heartfelt.The film that, for better or worse, confirmed Cruise as the action star of his generation, and while that means he has churned out a lot of action landfill for the past decade, the original Mission: Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, is a stone-cold classic. Somewhere, in all of our hearts, Cruise will be forever suspended on that zip wire.It is Cruise’s misfortune that his one real shot at an Oscar – before the Scientology weirdness ruled him out for ever – coincided with the year of Daniel Day-Lewis’s unbeatable performance in My Left Foot. His performance as a Vietnam vet is the definitive retort to any fool who insists he is a movie star, not an actor.Pure cinematic pleasure. Cruise is known as a screen-chewer, but it is too rarely acknowledged how good he is at playing second fiddle to a true ham: Hoffman in Rain Man and Jack Nicholson here. “I want the truth!” is Cruise at his Cruisiest, and there ain’t nothing wrong with that.One of three performances for which Cruise should have won an Oscar. Heretofore seen as almost asexual, Cruise is astonishing as TJ Mackie, the men’s rights activist guru with the catchphrase “Respect the cock!” No one could have imagined him in this role before. It’s now impossible to imagine anyone else playing it.Risky Business made Cruise famous, but it’s a terrible movie. Top Gun, on the other hand, made him a legend, and it remains one of the greatest movies of all time. Cruise, playing “a flyboy”, took to the film’s endearingly overt homoeroticism like a natural. The volleyball scene put a generation through puberty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c32c19fb1e9d90d2ed87e1a143eb988d242623/195_0_5467_3282/master/5467.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae38ab48cd4b5748a194997d9043cf7","title":"jumpsuits are the unrivalled look of the summer but why are they so popular","story":"Whether a playsuit for a party, a boilersuit for everyday or culotte-style for the heatwave, the jumpsuit is the must-have outfit right now. How did they become so ubiquitous?Jane Fonda’s stylist recently called jumpsuits “the epitome of a modern woman’s wardrobe”, and they have ushered in an age in which women no longer have to spend hours agonising over matching separates. At Ascot last year, they were finally decreed fit for the races, while that weathervane of high-street fashion, Asos, gave them their own category on its site in 2016, alongside skirts, trousers and tops.But why are they suddenly so popular? Perhaps a line could be drawn between our increasingly busy lives and the sartorial ease of a one-piece.It helps that, according to  stylist Melanie Wilkinson, “there really is a style to suit everyone … overall styles will look cool and modern”, or for a more pulled-together look “opt for a belted style”. If you’re more petite “this season’s culotte-style jumpsuit is ideal to avoid trouser legs puddling on the floor”.The jumpsuit has come a long way since it was first invented in the early 20th century by the Florentine artist Thayat, who wanted to create a liberating, anti-bourgeois item of clothing. In the 60s, Mick Jagger wore an Ossie Clark one with metal rings that apparently heated up under stage lights and burned his skin. In the 70s, Farrah Fawcett wore a deep-V silky emerald green jumpsuit in Charlie’s Angels, while the 80s brought Anneka Rice’s brightly coloured tracksuit versions.Stella McCartney has long been a fan, but arguably the pioneer for today’s renaissance is former Celine designer Phoebe Philo. When the woman credited as having the most influence on our wardrobes in the past decade wore a black tux-esque jumpsuit to the British Fashion Awards in 2009, fashion circles swooned. A few years later and they were big at Cannes, worn by Kristen Stewart and Jennifer Lawrence a “red-carpet rebel” next to more traditional, goody-two-shoes gowns.The most 2018 look in the jumpsuit family tree, however, is less about red-carpet glamour and more about workwear. The jumpsuit’s hard-grafting cousin the boilersuit is having a moment. Asos has seen a rise in demand, particularly for wrap-front styles, dungarees and casual boilersuits. M.C. Overalls is one brand nailing this aesthetic. Their £135 overalls come in functional navy, baby blue or pink and are built to last. According to founder and CEO James Scroggs, their utility “resonates with people as the bridge between our personal and professional wardrobes becomes muddled”.If you’re after a more subtle nod to the workwear aesthetic, you can always fall back on trusty dungarees. On Asos you’ll find them in red, floral and off-white as well as classic blue and black denims.So if you are yet to join the jumpsuit brigade in this long, hot summer, why not jump in, feet first?I like jumpsuits because they’re more put together than shorts and a T-shirt, and more practical than a dress, but you get the same visual impression. I’m doing the London sights sightseeing today with my friend from America – when it’s windy on the river, dresses blow everywhere. I think they’re good in a heatwave because they’re quite light. The one I’m wearing today is from Hollister – and I don’t usually shop there, but I saw it in the window. It was about £30.I wear jumpsuits about four times a week – they’re an easy, quick outfit and they’re comfortable and cool in this weather. I’ve been wearing them for a couple of years, inspired by how many there are now to choose from in the shops – you can have a different one for every day of the week. This one is from a charity shop and was £6.I like jumpsuits because they’re really easy. You can literally just slip them on and you feel very comfortable. Plus they’re great in a heatwave – especially this one, because it’s so airy. Over the years I’ve owned a lot. I was a singersongwriter and they were a good stage outfit. I’ve always found them really glamorous and I really love the 80s and that kind of overall vibe with big earrings. This one is from Asos. I can’t remember how much it was but it wasn’t that expensive.Jumpsuits are comfortable and easy they’re good to walk in. I don’t remember when I first started wearing them but it was probably when I was little. I now own about seven of them. I don’t think they’re particularly good in a heatwave, they’re a little sweaty. The one I’m wearing today is from Urban Outfitters and cost about $40.Jumpsuits have always been one of my favourite things to wear – I like the androgynous style. If we were going out later on tonight I could put on heels and look glam. Now I’m wearing sandals and I look summery and casual. I can’t count how many I own – I swap them around as I fluctuate in weight. I think they’re good for a heatwave, especially if they’re not the tight leotard kind. This one is black, which is not the best colour for the heat, but it’s backless so it’s breezy. It was from Finery and cost £85.Jumpsuits are comfortable and look stylish. I’ve been wearing a lot – I think as it’s summer and they’re doing lots of nice prints. I used to have lots for going out, now I have more casual ones. This one’s from Zara and cost £25.Oh, jumpsuits are so comfortable! And they keep you covered up, but not too covered up – when it’s weather like this, they’re really cool. They’re really flattering as well – I have quite a bottom-heavy shape and I think they quite suit it. I own up to 10, all different colours, textures and style. This one is from Missguided. It was definitely less than £15.I like jumpsuits because they’re practical, long and versatile because there are lots of different styles. I have about 10 in my current repertoire, and will wear them at least once a week. They’re not figure-hugging so they don’t stick to you in this weather. Even when it’s cold I’ll wear the shorter ones with tights. This one is from Hollister, probably via Asos. It cost about £30.I love jumpsuits, I’m obsessed – they are smart and comfortable but with a slight fashion edge. I’ve been wearing them for about two years. I used to think they looked like you were trying to make a different statement, and my style is quite classic, but now they’ve come into the mainstream they feel more classic. For business travel they’re effortless. I use jersey jumpsuits for long-haul flights – an air stewardess the other day wanted to know where one was from. They’re great in the heatwave – this one’s silk, so it’s lightweight. It’s from LK Bennett and was about £200.They’re very comfortable and they go with anything. I think they’re good in a heatwave, especially this one I’m wearing because it’s sleeveless and three-quarter-length. I think I own about three or four – some floral, some spotty. This one’s from Missguided – I can’t remember exactly how much it was, but it was reasonable.I got my first playsuit when I was 20 I was always told they suited me. They’re very cool and the shorts are handy for when you’re doing activities – you’re not always worrying about gusts of wind on the underground like you are with a dress. I’ve always felt comfortable wearing them. I have to make sure my legs are a bit tanned, but that’s only the same as wearing shorts. This one is from Primark and it was about €16.Jumpsuits are nice in summer, especially in Canada where you can’t wear this kind of stuff all year round. I’ve been wearing them for a couple of years and probably have about five. I think they might have been in style when I graduated and moved to the city. I got this one online, I think it’s shipped from China but I found it on Instagram. It was about US$30.

Between Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones’s high-profile respective debuts at Louis Vuitton and Dior Men, David Beckham’s first season as ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council (and a flashbulb-popping appearance at the Kent \u0026amp Curwen presentation alongside wife Victoria), Maison Margiela’s first menswear couture show and Calvin Klein creative director Raf Simons returning to Paris to show his eponymous label, the season became an unrelenting and reinvigorating expression of ideas. Here are the eight main trends to take away. Wallflowers take note: springsummer 2019 is not for you. A pre-eminent trend next season is the stuff of Day-Glo dreams. Neon popped up on sports tops, holsters and body warmers at Louis Vuitton, on sweatshirts at MSGM, on shirts at Xander Chou, on padded bomber jackets at Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and on suiting at Acne and Versace. The upshot? There’s a flavour for every raver.Momentum had been building throughout New York, London, Florence and Milan, but it was one of the final shows in Paris that cemented handbags as a bona fide trend for the boys next year. Newly installed artistic director of Dior Men, Kim Jones, reimagined the iconic women’s Saddle bag for the first time for men in backpacks, cross-body and belt-bags (cue cult status).Elsewhere, Jones’ successor back at Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh, was all about the handhelds his red plastic Keepall bags are pegged to be a big hit. Prada and Versace also got the memo creating shoulder and cross-body styles, while clutch bags at Dunhill, lunch boxes at Kenzo and bucket bags courtesy of Lanvin. Safe to say it’s all about the bag.The 90s music scene had a dominating presence at the shows. Britpop offspring could be found on the front row and the catwalk, the Stone Roses were the inspiration for Kent \u0026amp Curwen’s London presentation and an item distinctively synonymous with the era was out in force. Yes, the bucket hat is back and it’s come a long way from Kangol. Valentino, Fendi, Jacquemus, Band of Outsiders and (naturally) Kent \u0026amp Curwen put it back on their agendas. It came printed and textured, patchworked and plain and brimming with with its inherent “care, don’t care” vibes. The new look suit has been elevated for SS19 taking references from the 80s and incorporating couture craft. John Galliano at Maison Margiela unveiled his first artisanal collection in Paris and presented tailoring – like his womenswear – cut on the bias. Kim Jones at Dior, meanwhile, layered organza over embroidered wool to create a 3D effect.Double-breasted variations came oversized and relaxed, styled with a streetwear twist at Dries van Noten, wide-legged trousers and trainers at Paul Smith and with nothing underneath at Giorgio Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna. Shades, meanwhile, ranged from industrial grey to sherbet shades of violet, sky blue and rose-petal pink. At Cottweiler and Missoni they were made of leather at Off-white, they were elasticated and sporty at Fendi, they were given the double-F treatment at Hermés they were crisp and precision cut and at Prada there were no fewer than 23 pairs. Yes, short shorts are firmly on the sartorial agenda for SS19 – all that remains is to pick a tribe. Face masks have been cropping up in menswear periodically this past year, to compelling and dramatic effect. Their purpose varies. At Vetements’ highly politicised off-schedule show, street-cast Georgian models wore guerilla-style face masks with combat-wear in a show to reference Georgia’s war-torn past. At Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, they were a little more glam with surgical masks covered with fine crystals. At Alyx, Matthew Williams opted for a sportier take, combining anti-pollution masks in a collaboration with Nike.Rick Owens took things one brilliant step further and sent his models out wearing sheer, fringed versions as plumes of primary-coloured sulphur billowed around the set (showgoers were gratefully given them too). A nod to climate change or simply dramatic staging? Perhaps both.Think utility pockets and think fishermen, boy scouts and law enforcers? Tick, tick, tick. The number of pocketed gilets, jackets and harnesses confirmed that next season, its all about safe-keeping. Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton led the charge with a multi-compartmentalised body warmer Junya Watanabe and Samuel Ross at A Cold Wall* opted for a functional seatbelt-style numbers while Acne dotted a zipped compartment on sweaters. A word to the wise: just remember what you put where.There’s no stopping the rise and rise of the trench coat. After dominating the womenswear collections, it has set menswear in its sights for SS19. It stole the show at Alexander McQueen, coming in cropped, two-tone and spliced sleeve iterations, while Neil Barrett got eclectic with an abstract oversized leaf print. Berthold and Ami kept it classic, confirming its perennial appeal. Time to belt up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5eb6e0200fb9e2bb0a61683cf2ea6b5e791513/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db273cac9c2450ee8409ebda68fae206","title":"claude lanzmann a superstar intellectual of impeccable integrity and rigour peter bradshaw","story":"A contemporary of Sartre and de Beauvoir, Lanzmann was a dashing figure whose films about the Holocaust remain exemplars of honesty and good faithThe director Claude Lanzmann, who continued to make films and to publish into his 90s, was one of the great generation of postwar public intellectuals on the progressive left: a mandarin of European thought, a panjandrum of contemporary ethics. Lanzmann was a contemporary of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre with a dashing and even rather swashbuckling profile, a magazine founder, a petition signer, a superstar attender at soirées and conferences. It all made him appear as a man of action as well as a man of contemplation: and someone whose amours arguably marked him out as steeped in the robustly male sexual politics of an era different from the present day.Born to a Jewish family in Paris, he was a veteran both of the French resistance (in which he fought as a teenager) and of opposition to the Algerian wars, and his French citizenship and impeccable record of courage and heroism in the second world war gave him the objectivity and credentials to work on his remarkable masterpiece, Shoah (1985). This was in an age when there were many Holocaust survivors still alive, with fiercely strong memories, and indeed when many culpable Nazis were still secretly at large.Shoah was a nine-and-a-half hour oral history record of the Holocaust, edited down from 350 hours of raw interview footage it had some contemporary newsreel material but was effectively based entirely on verbal recollections of people involved: breaking down into four parts, discussions of three camps: Chelmno, Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau and the Warsaw Ghetto. Lanzmann interviewed the victims, survivors and witnesses, but also some perpetrators, including an SS officer, who had only agreed to speak off camera so they couldn’t be recognised. Lanzmann used a hidden camera for these interviews, an imposture which was widely hailed as entirely justified, though Lanzmann was physically attacked at one stage when the concealed camera was discovered. Lanzmann established a procedure for talking and thinking about the Holocaust which in its honesty, integrity, rigour and good faith has never been seriously challenged or repudiated. Attempts to show the horror on camera, either in documentary form or – more difficult still – as drama, are always liable to be criticised as sentimentalising, or sensationalising, or fetishising. But the austerity of just someone speaking is very different. The emphasis is simply on what happened, though always with a sense that the whole story can never be covered. The larger sense of why – why and how German nation came to embrace such evil – is not part of the film’s remit, and in fact Lanzmann did not care to venture into this arena of thought, in case it becomes a kind of counsel for the defence. For Lanzmann, the question defined the Wittgensteinian ne plus ultra: it was that whereof we could not speak. Later, in his film The Last of the Unjust, he tackled the question of complicity, by bringing to light his unused 1970s interview footage with Austrian Jewish survivor Benjamin Murmelstein, the “chairman” of the Theresienstadt Ghetto near Prague, reviled for having negotiated with Adolf Eichmann on the subject of enforced Jewish emigration. He is treated with great generosity by Lanzmann, who emphasises the cruelty and humiliation which these “elders” endured. When I met Lanzmann at the Cannes film festival last year, it was like meeting a Buddha of the cinema: he sat and listened to my questions seated in a kind of squatting position on a sofa, his chin resting on the handle of a cane, looking away from me and gazing out to sea. It was on the occasion of his one of his last films, Napalm, about a personal story which he first told in his memoir The Patagonian Hare. As a young man, he was part of a delegation to North Korea and had a passionate romantic escapade with a beautiful North Korean nurse. I suggested to him that there may have been elements of a honeytrap in this, and he reacted with extravagant and very funny scorn, emphasising the genuine passion with which he and the young woman kissed – he actually mimed hugging and kissing – and imperiously told me: “It is probably because you read too much John le Carré that you think this. But I like your idea. It is a very British idea.”Lanzmann was a remarkable man. An open, free, all-day showing of Shoah every 27th January at the BFI Southbank for Holocaust Memorial Day would be a great way for him to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568aaaff83aa6c531d989b2fe3f43f5bbcc9cb98/0_128_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce476f1af17f5df0871cd2615749f4ad","title":"cinnamon buns and coffee swedish fans in uk gear up for world cup clash","story":"‘It’s good being the underdog’ say expats as wave of optimism sweeps BritainSitting in the sunshine outside the Swedish church in Marylebone, central London, Birger Edström looks fairly relaxed about the prospect of his country’s football team facing England on Saturday.“When I saw we would be facing England I thought ‘yes!’,” he says with a laugh. “It would be harder to play Colombia. We have a very good chance to beat England once again. Yes! I think so!”In this piece of little Sweden, preparations are already under way for Saturday’s game, when the church hall will welcome 130 of London’s Swedish community. The walls are decked with enormous Swedish flags more flutter in beer glasses lined up on the stage where the big screen will go. Beers and coffee have been ordered cinnamon buns, of course, will be baked on the day.“Of course we are all excited,” says the church’s rector, Eric Muhl. “But I think the Swedish attitude is ‘wow this is happening’, and even if we lose we will still think we have done well. The England team have done very well, of course, but the Swedish team are not under the same pressure. We are the underdogs.”That kind of relaxed pragmatism is conspicuous by its absence in the UK, remarks Edström, who admits he is amused by the wave of optimism engulfing his recently-adopted home. “Honestly, I don’t think England have played very well so far,” he says. “They were lucky with the group and they won on penalties against Colombia, and when it is penalties anyone can win. But in this country England are always champions before they start playing. Let’s see afterwards who is the champion.”The match will be an exciting, but family-friendly affair in the main hall just off the Swedish church, which has stood on the same patch of land for 100 years. Sweden’s win against Switzerland on Monday attracted an interesting mix of expats, says Anja Holgersson, who works in the cafe. “There were the football lads in yellow and blue, but then we also had a knitting group of older women meeting in a separate room, and they came and joined in, too,” she says. “We had a lot of families and a play area for the children we had a lot of cinnamon buns and coffee and beers, of course. It was a lovely mix.” A recent arrival in the UK, she is amused by the “friendly abuse” Swedish expats are getting in their workplaces and friendship groups. “It will be very interesting on Sunday,” she says. “But it’s all good fun. I’ll be sad if it’s all over.While the reaction of English fans to Tuesday’s victory against Colombia has been compared to a desperate lover who starts planning a wedding after one decent date, Swedes have been more restrained, says Gunnar Ledwon.Asked what he thinks of his team’s chances, he is quietly confident. “I think England have better players in every position, but I think we are a better team together,” he says. The fact that Sweden’s best-known player, Zlatan Ibrahimović, is not at this World Cup has been unexpectedly positive, he adds. “We have no stars and that is a good thing, they play together as a whole group - both those on and off the pitch. So will the result come down to inidual quality or team spirit? It will be interesting to see.”With a last word of warning to over-exuberant England fans, he notes that despite the stardust, Sweden’s defence have proved very difficult to break down. “Just ask the Italians,” he says.

That overlooked the official’s leniency by opting only to caution Wilmar Barrios for flicking back his head into Jordan Henderson’s chest and jaw.Colombia were also quick to surround Geiger to protest his award of a second-half penalty following Carlos Sánchez’s foul on Kane. Their fitness coach, Eduardo Urtasun, attempted to provoke Raheem Sterling with a shoulder barge as the teams retired at half-time, and the physical intimidation is also understood to have stretched to pinching England players out of sight of the officials.“They were probably the dirtiest team I’ve ever come up against, in respect of when we won the penalty, surrounding the referee, pushing the referee,” Stones said. “The head-butt you’ve all seen, scuffing the penalty spot, a lot of off-the-ball things you probably haven’t heard about … all the sort of things that you don’t really hear in a football match. We showed massive character to keep cool heads and not get sucked into their game.“When you play against a team who want to fight, disturb your momentum, you can sometimes get dragged into it. We stuck to our plan, kept playing our own football. You can see the clips from the game. Some things I hadn’t even seen: the incident with Raheem Sterling and one of their staff … I’ve never seen a game like this before and how they behaved. I thought there could have been several red cards.“If the referee sees the headbutt it’s a totally different game. But the best thing for us was to beat them at football. The biggest thing that’ll hurt them is going back on the plane home. We’re into the next round.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef5a266c59dc1d218000313123da8b2423fcfcd/0_225_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=385bd66de2db97ad78ef769837445fda 1240w","title":"luis suarez uruguary world cup","story":"A deliberate handball on the line to stop Ghana going through to the World Cup semi-finals in 2010. A bite of Giorgio Chiellini’s shoulder in 2014. Four years and as many World Cup appearances later and we are still waiting to discover what Luis Suárez’s legacy will be in Russia, where Uruguay’s talisman has another – and possibly a last – shot at redemption on football’s greatest stage.By Suárez’s World Cup standards – and what standards they are – the striker has been relatively quiet. Poor in the opening game against Egypt, he went on to score against Saudi Arabia and Russia and also provided that terrific cross for the first of Edinson Cavani’s two goals against Portugal in the last 16 last Saturday. Yet it is his strike partner, born a few weeks after him, who has stolen the show. Cavani has scored more, shot more and run more than Suárez in Russia, despite spending less time on the pitch.Suárez is not the sort of player to stay in the shadows for long, especially when it comes to representing his country. Uruguay’s all-time leading scorer has a habit of serving up memorable storylines when he pulls on the sky blue shirt, in particular at World Cup finals, and his country could do with another, only this time with a much happier ending.Controversy stalks Suárez but, love him or loathe him, his scoring record is phenomenal. With 53 goals in 103 internationals, he averages better than one every other game for his country. At club level the figures are staggering. In the last five seasons, which comprise one campaign at Liverpool and four with Barcelona, Suárez has scored 141 league goals. To put that return into perspective, the only players to have scored more in Europe’s top five isions are Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Next on the list after Suárez comes Robert Lewandowski, followed by Cavani, which gives an idea of how just blessed Uruguay are when it comes to their forward line.Yet the frustration for Uruguay is that they have never been able to field that formidable partnership at a World Cup when it really matters. Suárez missed the 2010 World Cup semi-final defeat against the Netherlands through suspension after stopping Dominic Adiyiah’s goalbound header for Ghana, in the last minute of extra time, with his hands. “The hand of Suárez” is the title of that particular chapter in his autobiography. “The hand of the Devil” read a headline in a South African newspaper the next day, after Uruguay went on to win on penalties.Four years later, in Brazil, Suárez was sent home in disgrace after that extraordinary Chiellini incident, leaving Uruguay to face – and lose to – Colombia in the last 16 without him. Watching from his house in Montevideo, where tears rolled down his face as he listened to Óscar Tabárez, the Uruguay manager, defend him on the eve of the Colombia tie, Suárez knew what the outcome would be 24 hours later. “You could see that emotionally the team had died,” he wrote in his book, Crossing the Line.Russia had promised to be different, especially when Cavani scored his second against Portugal after linking beautifully with Suárez for the first, but once again Uruguay are facing the prospect of going into a defining game without their front duo. Cavani, who limped off against Portugal with a calf injury, is a major doubt for Friday’s quarter-final against France.The Paris Saint-Germain forward trained in Nizhny Novgorod on Thursday but those words read much more positively than the picture Tabárez painted at his press conference. Tabárez was extremely coy about whether Cavani will be able to play any part against the country where the forward has lived for the last five years, so much so it was hard to escape the feeling at the end of the manager’s answer that the best Uruguay can hope for is the 31-year-old is named among the substitutes.Sounding drained by the whole subject of Cavani’s fitness, Tabárez said: “He is very sad because he is suffering an injury during a World Cup. He’s a very important player for us and he was playing really well. So as soon as he got injured, he started working hard to recover. He’s concentrating on his dreams and his hopes. But I’m not going to say anything else about Cavani and I don’t want to get into any games. In less than 24 hours you will know. Some people are saying we are trying to pretend. We’re not. We don’t want to create any doubts.”Suárez never got a mention as Tabárez, an eloquent and erudite man, turned his attention to life at the other end of the pitch, where Uruguay, who have conceded only once in this tournament, will surely make life a lot more difficult for France’s attack than Argentina did. “What I can tell you, is that we really count on our defence,” Tabárez said.At the same time, Tabárez knows that Uruguay, with or without Cavani, will need a huge performance from their No\u0026nbsp9. For Suárez, who will be 35 by the time the next World Cup comes around, there will be no shortage of motivation as he seeks to bury the memories of all the chaos and controversy that has gone before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d20c24920355b64a563359397cc17c1dfd0f355/0_98_4386_2633/master/4386.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0211bc3983823e931a0202c5bf605a11","title":"tite brings calmness clarity candour coherent brazil","story":"It was one of several anecdotes peppered liberally into Tite’s press conference but his recounting of a conversation with Carlos Bianchi sent a few jigsaw pieces falling into place. “He once told me: ‘Tite, one of the great assets of a great team is to be mentally strong and have the capacity to be balanced and focused,’” the Brazil manager said. “That really got imprinted on my mind. We should have some common sense: neither euphoria, nor the fear of losing. Keeping your head cool and knowing you have a good collective performance.”Everything made perfect sense. Tite’s calmness and knack for man-management have been revelatory in this World Cup and the two years before it he has instilled a sense of clarity, feathered with a little lightness, into this Brazil team and it was little surprise to hear he learned from the best. Bianchi was renowned, during his spells managing Vélez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors, for his leadership skills and a club director once put it best by lauding his ability to instruct players “to put the toilet in the bathroom and the oven in the kitchen”. It captures the Tite process precisely: everyone accountable everything in its correct spot.The impression, a little more than 24 hours before Brazil were due to kick off against Belgium, was of total authority. Tite has been the most impressive figure among the managers at this World Cup, exuding gravitas and making encounters with the media feel like exchanges of ideas and information rather than exercises in secrecy and caution. Plenty is asked of him and plenty is given: after the win over Mexico on Monday he provided a detailed exposition of his defensive strategy, explaining how a tightly oiled side marks sectors before ball or man here he deconstructed the goals from that game in detail and mused at length about the emotional energy required to take penalties. If the idea is to compress so much openness and candour into half an hour that nobody has the energy to demand more, it is a sound one.That last sentence was accompanied by a smile and a wink. Firmino did not get on the pitch in the Serbia game, hence Tite’s special attention, but scored two minutes after his introduction against Mexico. It adds to the sense Tite has mastered the impossible, managing Brazil’s competing forces and fostering a club-side mentality that, allied to the natural talent at his disposal, creates a formidable beast.Perhaps the definitive evidence is that he seems to have tamed Neymar. It says something that the forward has turned heads more through the economy of his performances than their effervescence Tite talked up his “sense of teamwork, the best virtue” and talked up his appetite for “participating collectively”, perhaps aware that heavy praise can sometimes find a way of self-fulfilling. His philosophy is broadly that a solid, rigorously organised defensive and midfield structure lays the groundwork for – “incentivises”, in his words – those higher up the pitch to work their magic. Everyone is buying into the plan those last two wins have been low-maintenance, relatively low-key and entirely comfortable.In what could have been a largely esoteric ersion, Tite was asked by a Middle East-based journalist to reflect on his spell managing Al-Ain, the Emirati club, for a season in 2007. Back then he was a decade and a half into his managerial career but he replied in typical detail that, given the freedom to test his preferred lines of play, he developed his football philosophy there. He was away from the smothering circus of Brazilian football – or so went the implication – and could perfect his defensive system, trialling two lines of four and working on cohesion. It was a year that influenced him profoundly but, given he had been rattling through clubs at a tremendous rate back home, could not have felt at the time like a petri dish for leading Brazil ever closer to a sixth World Cup.If Belgium are overcome then it will begin to look overwhelmingly likely that those hours outside the spotlight were well spent. “I stopped two weeks ago and told the team: ‘You must believe in the intense way of practising we have … so keep up the good work, we need a full team, mentally strong, and I can feel it,’” he said. “The biggest challenge of a World Cup is fortitude. The pressure is immense, extraordinary.”They are handling it so far. Bianchi once said: “Orders are orders and they have to be clear but you have to give them with tact.” On the pitch and away from it, Tite’s Brazil appear to have struck an equally agreeable balance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca5946c7e4360964b92220401cdd2bb5d44f56d/0_34_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfc8b778bbab7bd282b11720f72f259","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70877fdc524aa2e59e0c51638667e245f71ccc3a/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f26c6d7f8f21dc46f1a3327460274231","title":"world cup quarter finals france uruguay england sweden belgium brazil croatia russia","story":"All the facts and figures for France v Uruguay, Belgium v Brazil, England v Sweden and Croatia v RussiaBy Martin Laurence for WhoScored, part of the Sport NetworkThe quarter-finals kick off in Nizhny Novgorod with what should be an intriguing tactical battle between two sides with very different styles. Uruguay are clearly the more settled and organised outfit. While both coaches can call upon world class talent, Óscar Tabárez has a team that equals the sum of its parts. That has not always been the case for France under Didier Deschamps.Finding the personnel and system that bring the best out of his star names has been a problem for Deschamps, who tends to revert to the tried and tested when the going gets tough.Antoine Griezmann has underwhelmed so far at the World Cup, with his two goals coming from the penalty spot. France’s only fluent attacking display came in the last round against Argentina, when they hit La Albiceleste on the counter. That tactic is unlikely to be as successful against Uruguay. Breaking down a defence controlled by José Giménez and Diego Godín will be easier said than done, as their clubmate Griezmann is all too aware. “Uruguay will be like Atlético,” said Griezmann this week. “They will take their time, fall, go to the referee. We will have to get used to that because the match will be boring and they will want to bring us into that.” Prediction: Uruguay 1-1 France (Uruguay to win AET).Friday night’s match in Volgograd is shaping up to be the most entertaining of the quarter-finals. It’s the favourites against the leading scorers. Belgium have scored at least three goals in the three matches Roberto Martínez picked his first XI their second string were also victorious against England but just not so prolific. It will be intriguing to see what line-up Martínez selects against Brazil. Both Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli will hope to have earned a start after they turned the game against Japan on its head.There was no such drama in the for Brazil, who beat Mexico relatively comfortably and were the only side to win their last-16 match by more than one goal. That said, Tite’s side have not been prolific in Russia. Despite having the most shots (77) and the most shots on target (31), they have scored just seven goals and never more than two in a game. In comparison, Belgium have scored 12 times.This game could be a slow burner. Belgium have only scored in the first half in one of their four matches and Brazil have scored five of their seven goals after the interval. It should catch fire in the second half, though. Belgium will look to exploit Casemiro’s absence through suspension. Fernandinho is an extremely capable replacement but Martínez would be wise to push Kevin De Bruyne further forward to occupy his Manchester City teammate.Both teams have plenty of firepower but Brazil have been more reliable at the back. Tite’s men have conceded just one goal at this World Cup – from a corner in their first game against Switzerland – and their opponents have been restricted to just five shots on target across four matches. Brazil’s dependable defence should see them through. Prediction: Brazil 2-1 Belgium.It’s time we gave Sweden the respect they deserve, not only for defying the odds at the World Cup but for doing so consistently over the last 18 months or so. Since crashing out of Euro 2016 and losing their best ever player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Janne Andersson has turned this squad into an incredibly functional team who are very difficult to beat. They have beaten Portugal, France and Italy since Euro 2016 and they topped a group where Germany were the clear favourites.They relish their underdog status and will not fear England. They boasting an impressive international record against England, with just one defeat in their last eight competitive encounters. They do have any star name but their record of five clean sheets in their last six matches shows they can rely on their defensive organisation.England have reasons to be concerned. They have struggled to create a great deal from open play since their scintillating start against Tunisia, particularly against the two stronger sides they have faced. Sweden have created seven more chances from open play than England but they do not have anyone as deadly as Harry Kane, who has scored six goals from just nine shots at this World Cup.England’s superior quality should just about win out, but it’s unlikely to be easy viewing yet again. Southgate’s side are the only quarter-finalists who have not kept a clean sheet in Russia so it may fall to Kane to bail them out once more. Prediction: England 2-1 Sweden.Having secured the upset of the round-of-16, if not the entire competition, Russia are beginning to believe in the seemingly impossible. With no optimism surrounding the squad or manager before the tournament, the hosts have already gone further than they would have expected and will see any progress from this stage as a huge achievement. Their odds to beat Croatia may not be as long as they were before the Spain match, but there remains little doubt about who will be the favourites in Sochi.That being said, Croatia’s performance in the round-of-16 left a lot to be desired. Zlatko Dalic’s side were among the most convincing teams in the group stage but looked well under par against Denmark. Russia manager Denis Cherchesov will have taken note of the way the Danes combated Croatia’s threat, particularly from Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic in midfield.Reports suggest that Alan Dzagoev, who was injured when Russia played Saudi Arabia in the first game of the tournament, could return, though that would likely force star man Aleksandr Golovin out wide. Denis Cheryshev should return and Russia are also likely to revert to a back four. The likely absence of left-back Yuri Zhirkov is a blow and we could see a crucial mismatch on that flank between his replacement, Fedor Kudryashov, and the lively Croatia winger Ante Rebic.Saturday night’s game is probably the toughest to call. These two sides have taken and conceded fewer shots on target than the other six quarter-finalists, so goals may be at a premium. The hosts will hope to ride the increasing wave of optimism but Croatia will surely improve from their last match and progress to the semi-finals.

I’ve been running ultra marathons for about 16 months now, but I’ve been mostly keeping to low-key, smaller races such as the Ring O Fire in Anglesey, or the Miwok 100K in California. These races are intimate: you get to know the other runners, the race organisers. You get to feel like an oddball as you shuffle alone at dawn through quiet country towns with your backpack and head torch.But with the UTMB looming – the biggest ultra mountain trail race in the world – last week, it was time to get my first taste of the razzmatazz of the European ultra trail circuit, by taking part in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail in the Italian Dolomites.The world of ultra running may still be little known in the UK or the US, but in France, Spain and Italy, these races are huge. In the piazza of Cortina d’Ampezzo, just before the 11pm start, the town is alive with noise and bustle. As well as the 1,600 runners cramming into the start area, thousands of people have come out to cheer us on our way, sitting high up on walls, dancing on hotel balconies, as a huge sound system gees everyone up.The race is 120km along some spectacular and steep mountain trails. It’s a daunting prospect, so I hang near the back as the moment to start approaches. Up at the front, superstars of the sport such as the Americans Hayden Hawks and Tim Tollefson, Fernanda Maciel from Brazil, and the former Nepalese child soldier Mira Rai, are introduced to the crowd to huge cheers. You rarely see this much excitement or buzz at the start of a road race. This is a sport full of colour and adrenalin, with lean, chiselled mountain men and women with tattoos and expansive handshakes everywhere. And a lot of beards.And then, as the clock strikes 11, and to the strains of the race’s theme tune, The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, we’re off. The showboating is over – now it’s time to run.With so many competitors, once we leave the town and head into the mountains, the narrow trails get congested to the point where I’m often forced to walk, or even stop completely. But this is good, I need to force myself to slow down in the early stages of these races. Too often in my fledgling ultra career I’ve set off too fast, too eager, and I’ve ended up being that guy slumped by the side of the trail at 90km, not sure how I’m going to continue. Not this time, I tell myself, as I wait for another bottleneck to clear.The night ticks slowly by, traipsing up and down through woodland trails, following the highway of head torches, until the chilly morning emerges suddenly and we find ourselves face to face with the immensity of Tre Cime, a huge trio of rocky peaks that seem otherworldly in the dawn light.After some pasta soup at a crowded aid station – who knew mini star-shaped pasta floating in vegetable stock could taste so good? – we begin the first long descent back down into the valley.These mountain races are, of course, a series of climbs and descents, and until today I’ve always struggled with both, having come to ultras from road running. But today, finally, it all starts to make sense.On the climbs, I have a new friend, a pair of Leki hiking poles. I’ve always been resistant to using poles in races. It reinforces the walking element of mountain trail running, which I try to ignore. I like to think of myself as a runner, not a hiker. This is ultra running, I tell myself, not ultra hiking. Besides, the runners I’m most impressed by, people such as Kilian Jornet and Zach Miller, seem to cope just fine without them.But the truth is that in a 120km mountain race like this, I’m going to spend a fair amount of time hiking up steep climbs, and poles certainly look like they might help. When I ran the 100 Mile Sud de France in October, I was pretty much the only person in the race without poles.Of course, you’re supposed to practice with poles before you use them. So you don’t trip yourself up. So you know how to store them when you’re not using them. So any number of a thousand possible unseen problems can be avoided in advance of the race. But practising with poles when you don’t live near any mountains is not easy. I tried them out on the coast path near my home in Devon, but the climbs are so short – even though they can be very steep – that I’m forever putting the poles away and getting them out again. It’s all good pole practice, but it slows your run down. So I do it once. It doesn’t seem so difficult.In the event, the race becomes the practice. By the time I’m finished, I have it nailed. I barely grip the poles, but let them mostly dangle in the straps around my wrists. That works better, and doesn’t rub my hands. And they really seem to help. It’s like having a rail to hold on to up the biggest ascents. Throughout the race, even though getting them out of my bag is a hassle, I use them on every climb.But it is the descents where things really click for me. I keep waiting for my legs to start complaining, but on each downhill I just let myself go, flying and skipping along through the field. From 900th position at the first checkpoint in the race, about 10 miles in, I gain around 100 places on every descent. People look at me racing by, particularly near the end, with a touch of annoyance. It does seem a little unfair to be making up so much ground on the downhills. They’re the easy bit. But why doesn’t everyone else go a bit faster?I know why. I’ve been there before, where your legs are so tired that even going downhill is a struggle, where your legs don’t want to, or can’t, lift your feet from the ground. Where all you can do to stop yourself sitting down is to keep up a slow, pained, forward shuffle.But after 10 ultra races, for the first time, I’m not that guy. I’m that other guy. The one who comes from nowhere, full of energy, skipping past you, and you think, bloody show off.In the end, I finish, 120km later and in 366th position, back in the buzzing town of Cortina. Twenty-one and a half hours. I grab my free beer and sit down in the square to take it all in. Something has shifted. My whole perception of time and distance seems to have changed, because suddenly it doesn’t seem that crazy to have been out running for so long. When I started ultra running, the thought of running for more than four hours felt a little insane. I remember the first time my GPS clicked past 30 miles and finding it hard to process. But now, well it seems sort of normal. Seventy-five miles is a long run, sure. But not that long.Still, I’m shivering and tired and night is falling, so I’m grateful that Giovanni, the owner of Hotel Villa Argentina, is a runner and has given everyone in the race his phone number so that when we finish he will come and pick us up and scoot us back to the hotel bar for pizza and lemon soda, followed by a long, warm bath. All those things that are just bloody incredible after a long run. Even if it’s only a 21.5-hour-long run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb22606db67bee3a070487bc1335173d9c93322/0_44_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7525b4e5e6fb00851e0b7c27b68bfcfd","title":"moving stories the great student halls v home debate","story":"For some, getting a room in halls of residence is the best way to begin life at university. Others want low-cost living at home for as long as possible. But what are the benefits of each option, and is it still possible to have a full university experience if you’re living away from uni? “When you first arrive in London, especially from abroad, it’s great to be living in university halls,” says Victoria Smith Graterol Chirinos, 19, a journalism student at Goldsmiths, University of London. You’re immediately connected to life in the capital.“I came to London from Basel in Switzerland and I love the city. There’s so much going on, there is never a day with nothing to do. It’s easy to get into central London from the Goldsmiths campus in New Cross. I do that often and enjoy the vibe, but I always like to get home to a quieter, residential area,” she says. Students living in halls will generally have their own room in a shared flat, and it’s a good way to meet people. “The nice thing about living in halls is that there is always someone there to hang out with,” says Jaxson Mannes, 18, a first-year psychology student at Goldsmiths. He’s an ambassador for the university’s Surrey House halls of residence, where students live in flats, sharing a kitchen. Part of his job, which is paid for by the university, is to provide information and encourage a sense of community.“Most of my role is planning events and activities to engage students and make it fun for the whole of the year, not just welcome week. When there was a cold spell earlier in the year, I noticed students were holed up in their rooms, so I started a weekly music listening party in the Orangery, our common room, and I used some of my budget to provide free food,” he says.On the other hand, it’s much cheaper to live at home with your parents, says first-year politics student Niquella Simpson-West, 19. “I like living at home and I have a good relationship with my parents,” she says. “It didn’t seem worth paying rent when I could commute.“The drawback is the time and money it takes for travel to go to the library or events on days when you don’t have any lectures or seminars.”For those living nearer to the university, an advantage of New Cross and nearby areas like Brockley, Peckham and Camberwell, is that private rented accommodation is more affordable than in many other parts of London in zone 2. Some students, such as 24-year-old Danielle Jombla, who is studying management and entrepreneurship, arrange their own rentals before they arrive. She wondered if she would miss out by not being in halls, but found it easy to meet people. “At the start of the course we had the opportunity to take part in icebreakers in order to get to know one another. One of the challenges I had was that I can be quite shy, so I had to make a real effort. Whether you live on campus or not, you can make friends and enjoy life at university. It’s about being friendly and putting yourself out there to be sociable,” she says.No matter where you live, you can feel part of things, says Karyma Ellis, 24, a final-year music degree student. “I’ve tried all three options. For my first term, I lived at home in Islington. Then a place in halls came up for the rest of the year – and since then I have been in private rented accommodation,” she says.Living with her family meant saving money on rent, but Ellis was nervous at first about losing out on the wider scene. “I was adamant that I was not going to miss out on anything and I joined a Facebook group for Goldsmiths commuter students. We met on the first day and we kept it up, meeting a lot of new people along the way. In welcome week there were team events, and alongside the halls teams there were teams for students who weren’t in halls. I stayed all day and went to everything I could,” she adds.“The key thing, whether you are living around the corner or living an hour away, is to make an effort.”The university’s head of accommodation services, Rocchi Acierno, says: “Many students decide to live in university halls for the first year, while others prefer to stay at home with their families and commute or share rented flats and houses. The choice is very much down to the inidual.”  Although some may feel living in halls will give them the full student experience, he believes there is no reason why anyone deciding to keep costs down by living at home should miss out on the wider university life.“We recognise that a lot of students are living with their families or renting privately, so our campus support officers are on hand to help all students who need advice out of hours, not just those in our halls,” he adds. “Our student hall ambassadors are there for students to speak to, and they also arrange social events for residents. Even if you’re not in halls, there are social events going on for everyone at the students’ union or organised by the different clubs and societies.”Goldsmiths, University of London is based on a single-site campus in New Cross, south-east London.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.

But he met his toughest challenge yet when his mentor Kanye West started championing Trump ...A surprising piece of trivia surfaced during the three-year wait for a new album by Pusha T. The rapper – whose cocaine-dusted songs detail the paranoia and luxury of his drug-slinging past on the streets of Virginia – apparently wrote the McDonald’s I’m Lovin’ It jingle. The radiant ba-da-ba-ba-baa – originally voiced by Justin Timberlake – that closes the fast food chain’s television ads? Yep, it was the work of an MC best known for dead-eyed tales delivered over steely beats, the artist’s camp confirmed in June 2016.Others involved in the ad campaign have since claimed the jingle as theirs, but the rap internet was entertained nonetheless. As a couple of anti-obesity campaigners joked, Pusha had finally found something deadlier than drugs to centre his music on. But it also offered a glimpse of a lighter side to a revered hip-hop scowler whose 20-year career has been defined by gritty reality. “I sold more dope than I sold recordsyou niggas sold records, never sold dope,” he scolded his peers on 2014’s Hold On. He neglected to mention that he helped sell Happy Meals, too.We meet for lunch on a hot bright afternoon in central London, where Pusha T’s own sunny side is also in evidence. “I’m the same as when I was doing field day in school, man. I wanna be the best. I gotta win that blue ribbon,” beams Pusha – real name Terrance Thornton – as we sit down, explaining the competitive streak that led to his career-best new album, Daytona, not to mention his recent beef with long-time adversary Drake. He is dressed in black and sports the same bob of braids he has had since his emergence as part of legendary 00s duo Clipse, punctuating his anecdotes with laughter in the same way he pierces his verses with sinus-clearing sneers.Daytona, he suggests, should reinforce his position “as a force who represents the hip-hop purists”. The album was produced by close collaborator Kanye West in a rustic Wyoming mansion, part of an ambitious plot by the pair’s GOOD Music imprint to record and release five albums by five artists in five weeks. It is a lean thunderbolt of synapse-firing samples and rhymes that retreads Pusha’s hustling days from the chaise longue of a VIP room. Although surrounded by “cocaine concierges” and near-infinite riches, the 41-year-old remains stalked by the suspicion that it could all come crashing down in a moment. “I am just a short stone’s throw from the streets,” he reminds himself on the chilling Santeria, a track dedicated to his former road manager DeVon “Day Day” Pickett, who was stabbed to death in Philadelphia during an altercation outside a bar in 2015.“We were calling it therapy,” Pusha recalls of the making of Daytona. “The goal was to recreate feelings. I dove into a bag of my favourite music: RZA, Scarface, D’Angelo, Lauryn Hill. If it didn’t have this feeling, it didn’t make the album.” Working on the album in such a small window of time meant relying on instinct, a creative process that he says felt “unorthodox, disruptive, urgent”. No expense was spared: Pusha and West spent an estimated “$8,000 a day” to stay at the Wyoming resort, “finding the right textures, the right samples” before recording a note of music, while the record’s controversial cover – a photo of Whitney Houston’s bathroom, covered in drug paraphernalia, that infuriated the late singer’s estate – cost $85,000 to license.And like the rest of the GOOD Music releases that followed it – West’s isive Ye and his collaborative album with Kid Cudi, Nas’s first new music in six years, and an LP from rising R\u0026ampB star Teyana Taylor – it was only seven tracks long, countering the bloat of streaming-era rap albums. “It was a practical decision: Kanye wanted to produce all of the albums. Five albums of seven tracks is 35 tracks, that’s do-able.” Not that he has time for long albums. “You’re just trying to cheat your streaming numbers. I’ve yet to hear a really incredible long album. So to hell with that.”Although the album’s lyrics don’t encompass any of the political activism that has occupied his spare time since his last release (a campaigner for Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election, Pusha is a passionate advocate for prison reform and in 2016 appeared with director Ava DuVernay in a debate on the US prison system), it is full of quiet reflections on race and America. “Now we blend in, we chameleons,” he spits on Come Back Baby, a reference to the current wave of black artists achieving “God-level rock star status”, as Pusha puts it.“I used to sit back and read the back of USA Today. The top grossing tours would be Pink Floyd and the Eagles, and I would wonder when Run DMC would be up there,” Pusha says. “Seeing Jay and Kanye among this ... it’s inspiring.” His admiration for West is unfaltering, even at a time where you might suspect their relationship is on the ropes. Three weeks before the release of Daytona, a hand grenade was thrown among West’s fan base, the debris forming a thousand think-pieces. After a string of tweets praising “my brother” Donald Trump and showing off a Make America Great Again hat signed by the president, West remarked in a TMZ interview that 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice”.West has since claimed that his comments were taken out of context, and Pusha has some sympathy with this. “I feel like the keywords in what he said were so strong and powerful, that it doesn’t let you get into the nuances, the underlying perspective. Or even wanna hear how he’s thinking,” he explains. “I told him that if you’re really trying to get a point across, you have to be mindful a little bit about what’s gonna tick people off, so you can get to your end goal.” He blames the outburst for the muted critical reception afforded to the Ye album (Pitchfork called it “undoubtedly a low point” in his career). “People are a bit scared to embrace Ye now. Fine, whatever bro. That comes along with saying the controversial shit.” West’s opinions, he points out, haven’t softened his own stance on the current Oval Office incumbent. “The Make America Great Again hat is this generation’s Ku Klux hood. When was America so great anyways? Name that time period?”Despite the storm clouds, Daytona was instantly hailed as a classic, his best work since Hell Hath No Fury by Clipse, the rap group he formed with older brother Gene, who was then known as Malice. As well as making a street star of Pusha, Clipse also introduced America to fellow Virginia Beach resident Pharrell Williams, whose Neptunes production team provided the stark, menacing beats underpinning their drug-hustle fairytales. Williams calls Pusha at one point during our interview and the pair end someone’s career while Pusha takes bites of softshell crab. “That new artist who got a little hype then became non-responsive? Tell him to get the fuck outta here! Waste of my fucking time!” says Pusha down the phone.Malice and Pusha were born in the Bronx, but moved to Virginia when Pusha was aged two, returning to New York each summer to visit their grandmother, where they mingled with locals and got their first taste of hip-hop. As they grew older, Malice began writing raps, which Pusha attempted to emulate, eventually teaming up as teens to become Clipse. By the time Pusha was 19, they had signed to Elektra Records. After a couple of false starts, the pair began winning fans in all sorts of unexpected places. “It’s two guys from Virginia, and it’s very abstract. There’s no bass there. When I listen to it, I kick myself,” said the Velvet Underground’s John Cale, praising their “amazing minimalism”. Timberlake leaned on the pair’s authenticity for his pivot to R\u0026ampB, featuring them on his debut solo single, Like I Love You.The fact they were now regular faces on MTV didn’t dull their edge, though: enraged by a standoff with record label Jive Records, 2003’s Hell Hath No Fury found them “mad, angry and pissed the fuck off”, as Pusha put it. The group eventually disbanded: Malice changed his name to No Malice and stepped away from rap, deterred by a federal investigation into Clipse’s circle that eventually landed their manager, Anthony Gonzales, in prison for 32 years on drug-trafficking charges. Pusha charged ahead into a solo career: a couple of critically acclaimed mixtapes and albums followed, as well as scene-stealing guest spots on West’s Runaway and Future’s Move That Dope.“I’ve still got the same appetite now that I did then,” he insists. “It’s about competing with the times, not just living in the times. I don’t wanna just exist. I want to win. I want to be timeless. The real competition is with time, not with people.” Tell that to Drake. This summer, the long-simmering feud between Pusha and the Canadian superstar spilled over into a couple of vicious diss tracks, sparked by Drake’s Two Birds One Stone, on which he admonished Pusha for inflating his “drug dealer stories”. A track on Daytona, the smoky Infrared, fired back at Drake’s use of ghostwriters. Drake brought Pusha’s fiancee, Virginia Williams, into it. Pusha responded with nuclear ferocity, exposing in three brutal minutes, on the track The Story of Adidon, his rival’s “secret” child and a photoshoot in which he posed in blackface makeup. It was the only rap beef in history to have ended with an MC forced to post on social media a grovelling clarification written on his iPhone Notes app: the photograph, Drake explained, dated from a pre-fame acting project that represented “how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment”.“He said what he said, I said what I said, now it’s done. It stayed how it was supposed to stay, just words,” grins Pusha. “It was definitely good for hip-hop. What has been more energetic than this?” On Drake’s new album, Scorpion, he addresses Pusha’s revelations about his child with the lyrics: “I wasn’t hiding my kid from the world, I was hiding the world from my kid.” Will he give it a listen? “Hell yeah! I gotta have something to compare Daytona to, don’t I?” he says.His publicist beckons – our time is up. Tonight, he flies to Oslo, where he will perform with Eminem. Then it is back to his home in Virginia, true to his lyric on Daytona, a stone’s throw from the streets where it all began. Next week, work could begin on another set of impulsively created GOOD Music releases. “Kanye’s been calling me every day like, ‘We gotta go back in!’ When I’m back, I’m gonna call him and check his temperature. I’m already on to the next thing. He’s got stuff he wants me to hear, I’ve got stuff I want him to hear. Our excitement meter is all the way up right now.”Pusha wants to keep working while the energy is this good, while he and his accomplices are still on this creative buzz. In other words, to quote a popular fast food chain: he’s loving it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9b555787970da6101e91e669b26b9459d398a9/0_0_2251_1350/master/2251.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5767ad0d9d4e955c5ad4b2dab29d668","title":"stormzy launches merky books publishing imprint penguin random house","story":"The chart-topping grime star will publish his own book, Rise Up, with the new imprint, which will be ‘a platform for young writers’Grime rapper Stormzy has announced a partnership with Penguin Random House, to set up a new publishing imprint called #Merky Books.It will be part of a growing #Merky empire, which already encompasses a record label and music festival, and Stormzy said he was “super proud” of the collaboration. “We will be using this as a platform for young writers to become published authors,” he wrote on Instagram. “I know too many talented writers that don’t always have an outlet or a means to get their work seen and hopefully #Merky Books can now be a reference point for them to say ‘I can be an author’ and for that to be a realistic and achievable goal.”“Reading and writing as a kid was integral to where I am today,” he continues, “and I from the bottom of my heart cannot wait to hear your stories, your poems, your novels, your sci-fis and then getting them out into the big wide world.” He also announced there will be paid internships at the imprint.The first book #Merky will publish is by Stormzy himself, titled Rise Up: The #Merky Story So Far. Penguin Random House describe it as: “Featuring hundreds of never-before-seen photographs, annotated lyrics and contributions from those closest to him. Rise Up is Stormzy’s story, in his words, and the record of a journey unlike any other.” The rapper shot to fame in 2015 with his Shut Up freestyle, and went to No 1 in the UK charts with his debut album Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer in 2017, which also won him two Brit awards. He recently hosted the #Merky festival in Ibiza, featuring himself alongside a host of British MCs. Footage went viral of him pausing his own performance at the festival to watch England’s penalty shootout against Colombia.In January he signed a partnership deal between his label #Merky and Atlantic Records, describing it on Twitter as: “Beginning of a new chapter. Looking forward to delivering more music, more bodies of work and to start developing and working on new talent on the #Merky roster.

I have been at that door so many times. The one you walk through into his apartment, or let him through into yours, and something shifts. It’s as quick as the click when the optometrist slides a new lens into the eye-test machine: a clear, almost weightless little sliver of a thing, but with the power to make the world resolve into clarity – or blur out, leaving you nauseous and unbalanced.Once, it was the door to the celebrated journalist’s apartment that I stumbled through, aged 21. I’d taken a train to New York to meet him for career advice and, unexpectedly, he had suggested we meet at a bar, then bought me several martinis. But then again, I drank them. Whose fault was the sex that ensued? And then there was the door to an AirBnB I rented in Uruguay in 2014, with a pushy local journalist I had just met trailing behind me. As I fumbled with my keys, I remember thinking: how did I get here?Me too. Isn’t that frightening? That almost every woman today can say these words? Finally, we are having a conversation about the sexual harassment – and the sexual encounters – that have left us feeling damaged. And yet there’s a kind of uncertainty still hovering around the unfolding conversation – something still tucked into the shadows. Some people have said women are being inconsistent, re-remembering encounters they hadn’t had a problem with at the time. Others wonder why women – particularly young women – are feeling so fragile, acting as if they have been terribly wounded by something as apparently minor as a leer.Complaints about boorish behaviour or lame one-night stands, this critique goes, have the potential not only to delegitimise real accusations of rape, but #MeToo’s whole message. When a writer recently accused the novelist Junot Díaz of “forcibly kissing” her (which he denied) and other women came forward to say Díaz had acted aggressively towards them in public, a friend of mine in her 40s – a feminist who writes with empathy about women who kill their abusive partners – worried that Diaz was being pilloried for “assholery”, not legally actionable crimes. Just after saying that, though, this friend began to recount her own first kiss. The boy had shoved her hard up against a fence. She started to laugh, as if to pass it off as a wacky youthful memory, like a zit popping during a job interview. But it was clear something in her still wanted to cry.The problem is, it’s this ill-defined area between “assholery” and attempted rape that troubles many women. This is hard to talk about, and increasingly so, as we perceive the damage that just remembering can apparently wreak. When I asked if it was “the right time” to write about my experience with the New York journalist, another male writer said to me, “Hell, no!”, telling me that “careers are being ruined”. But I don’t want to ruin anybody’s career.We are having these conversations at last, but we are not talking much about the historical context. I think this is the key to understanding how women are feeling now. For me, born in 1983, the context was the 90s – a peculiar era, caught between the confidence that there had been fabulous progress in the relationship between the sexes, and the smouldering remnants of a past in which bold women were feared and ridiculed.In the 1990s, the pressure on young people to succeed was intense. Women’s bodies and their sexual choices became the focus of ever-harsher scrutiny, and the expectation was that they would be perfect.I remember leaving my childhood home for college in 2001. Among the items I packed were a pair of what everybody then was calling “fuck-me boots”: knee-high black leather boots with a four-inch heel. Like my textbooks, I felt the fuck-me boots were preparing me for adulthood – for a decisive step out of the self-doubt of my teens. It wasn’t that I associated adulthood with fucking. It was more that I was determined to become the kind of woman who was fuckable in just the right way. I still remember the look I gave myself in the mirror I’d pasted on the back of my dorm-room door the first night I put the boots on, to wear to a frat party, along with a slash of lipstick in berry pink. It was a look of wonder and hope: it felt like a magic mirror, and with those boots on I could stare myself into what I wanted to become.The hopes of the end of the millennium were the mirror in which I saw myself. But the young woman there was only a picture. In flesh and blood, by the time I became a woman, I had already been singed by those smouldering embers of the past. And thus, I entered adulthood as two people: the image my era wanted me to be, and the other woman, the hidden one, the one with a body.It’s 1993. I’m almost 10. In apartments across the US, Madonna’s new book, Sex, graces coffee tables, the cover depicting her in the throes of an orgasm. My family has just moved from the city to a house in the suburbs. My parents gave me – the child – the “master bedroom”. It had a wall-length closet covered in mirrored doors. I woke up every day staring at myself.It was a narcissistic decade, but it was a strange narcissism, premised on the idea we could remake ourselves any way we liked, virtually from scratch. People came home from vacations in Germany with pieces of the Berlin Wall the feeling was not that they’d got a memento of German reunification, but a piece of the ultimate wall, some figurative wall whose crumbling represented the tumbling-down of a whole world. My father, a former Reagan administration official, filled up our house with kitsch he found on trips to Moscow. Muddling around for the house keys, I’d touch medallions of Stalin and Lenin in the bowl in the hall.The message I got from these objects was that enmity, conflict, maybe even pain – all the kinds of things my parents told me they’d had to fear as kids in the early 60s, when their schoolteachers made them hide under their desks in case of a Soviet nuke – were all some kind of big joke. We could keep Stalin in our house as an amusement, like those 19th-century Europeans who displayed the shrunken heads of conquered Polynesian tribes.Unmanageable male lust was one of those things we hoped would become a kind of relic that we didn’t take all that seriously. Men in that decade’s pop culture tended to be harmless – think the goofs of Seinfeld and Friends. One of the bestselling American books of the early 90s, You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, reassured readers that resolving miscommunications between the sexes was actually easy, if we just understood how to do it. Solutions were big then. A couples therapist named Harville Hendrix sold hundreds of thousands of copies of a guide called Getting the Love You Want, which unravelled “the mystery of romantic attraction” and answered “humanity’s yearning” in just 384 pages.I remember my early girlhood as surrounded by a shimmering halo of possibility. Explaining the long-term inconveniences of an oesophageal surgery I’d had as an infant, my pediatrician told me with a wink that the only thing I could never be was an astronaut: as if, without that little fault, I’d have definitely gone to Mars. My friends and I loved the cartoon The PowerPuff Girls: “Sugar, spice, and everything nice,” the narrator intoned. “These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. But Prof Utonium accidentally added a can of whoopass to the concoction!” The PowerPuff Girls combined traditional female perfection (Mary Jane shoes, pigtails) with post-feminist female badassery (they whooped bad guys).The success of MTV’s Real World – not, it was clear, real – confirmed that reality didn’t really matter the only things that had to be real were our dreams. Oprah was the preacher of that decade. She told us we just didn’t have to believe in bad things any more. Fear, she said, was a useless emotion it was all in our minds. Failure and lasting heartbreak were the monsters of the human childhood, which just vanished as soon as we opened the closet door. Her frequent guest, the motivational author Iyanla Vanzant, told a live audience in New York: “You can use words to totally redefine reality. What I do when I hear myself say ‘can’t’ is, I cancel it out. Cancel the word. Cancel the thought. You shouldn’t have any ‘problem’. ‘Problem’ means you are powerless. ‘Problem’ means you are weak. Say ‘ine opportunity’.”It wasn’t clear how men would fit into the picture of young 90s women’s futures. What guy on Seinfeld or the Simpsons could keep up with an ambitious woman? The lead male character in American Pie, the classic 90s comedy, tried to fornicate with a pastry.In sex education classes, we spent endless time watching videos of sperm penetrating an egg, or labelling diagrams of the testes there was no sense of a real man connected to these sexual organs, but there was a firm message of fear. Our instructors terrified us with stories of how condoms could fail, exposing us to STIs that would destroy our potential we were taught about sex in the same classes as hard-drug awareness, implying it was a bit like cocaine, a quick thrill that could prove ruinous.Though we were supposed to be the first generation that didn’t need men in a material sense, my friends and I in high school were absolutely obsessed with guys. We talked about little else. We didn’t know what men were for, but I think we wondered whether they could turn out to be the secret key – a kind of final stage in our self-development, or a confirmation that we had become as awesome as we were supposed to be. When I think back to that time, I remember a scene from my favorite teen TV show, Dawson’s Creek. Pacey, a boy, tried to tell two of his female friends about a serial killer who was reportedly stalking the region. “He cuts out women’s hearts,” he warned. Joey, a girl, just laughed. Jen, the other girl, smiled beatifically and said: “He’s probably just looking for love.” A powerful enough woman, in other words, could be a literal alchemist, turning even the worst heart-eating murderer into a good guy.Female ambition was purportedly encouraged. But when it actually manifested in a real woman, it was often depicted as deadly, contradictory or grotesque. When Fergie, the Duchess of York, tried to recover from her orce by entering business, a nasty Independent article, written by two women, mocked her efforts: “Goodness, she would have a jolly good go at anything!” Donald Trump had a tower and a plane, but it was Imelda Marcos, the wife of Philippine dictator Ferdinand, with her vast collection of shoes, who became the decade’s symbol of greed. In her 1991 biography of Nancy Reagan, Kitty Kelley accused the president’s wife of secretly “ruling the White House with a Gucci-clad fist”. Diana was applauded for rejecting her ugly prince. But she was also painted as reckless for getting killed with her playboy lover in a car chase with paparazzi.Around the time the Bobbitts were in the news, I started to become very fearful. I wrote diary entries. Anxiety – over my grades, over the need to be perfect – was a theme. “I will get better and better at sledding,” I encouraged myself. I impressed on myself the need to be good, even at the things I did just for fun. “Goals: to work harder. Spend more time on homework and less time drifting away and ending up with my nose in a book.” After a report card came home, I mourned: “As the grownups say, I am not living up to my potential.” I was eight years old.Coexisting with the sense of limitless possibility was a strong counterstrain of dread. If life in the late 20th century could theoretically be perfect, then any wrong step was potentially catastrophic. On an Oprah episode called Stranger Danger, an “anti-abduction” specialist taught a group of very young children how to evade potential kidnappers by doing things such as jumping into rubbish bins or kicking out the brake lights of the car if a paedophile locked them in the boot. “Fantastic way to signal the police,” he’d say.The kids in the show, though, struggled to contain giggles. In that situation, who would remember to kick out the brake light? I remember learning stuff like this – the sinkholes to misfortune I might stumble across in the future, and how to tiptoe around them – and just laughing, too. It felt so much easier, and more powerful, to imagine danger just didn’t exist or could be risen above, as the girls in Dawson’s Creek did, than to acknowledge we could screw up our glittering destinies.At 16, I got my first boyfriend. But I couldn’t enjoy it. I was timid and terrified, unable to voice my feelings or concerns. I felt muzzled by contradictions: love could be everything love was a distraction. He wasn’t the right guy he might be the right guy and I would blow it. I had become detached from my real instincts, because love was an achievement, rated, in some vague way, by outside forces.When my boyfriend grew depressed and increasingly angry, I felt I had to figure out how his behaviour was actually due to my actions. As a young woman, the infinite power I’d been told I had turned out to have given me infinite responsibility – and that was a terrible burden. He was like a gear in the complicated but glorious machine I was assembling called my life, and if he went wonky, it must be my fault.I spent a lot of time sobbing in car parks. When I broke up with him, I brought him a fruit basket. I wanted so much for a bad thing to be good, to make a “ine opportunity”. As I got in my car to leave, he threw himself under the front wheels. The emotion I recall is numbness, a sense of profound dissociation. The more messed-up the evening got, the more I had to pretend it was almost funny, a “crazy” story I would later tell my girlfriends – proof of promising qualities I had been assured of in magazine personality quizzes, like adventurousness and a willingness to let life unfurl in all its wackiness.The writer Andrew Solomon has explored the lives of prodigies, gifted children burdened from a very young age by great expectations. The experience, he writes, is “isolating, mystifying, petrifying”. I think many millennial women, and not just the wealthiest ones, had youths a little like prodigies. We were invested with the hope that the suffering of generations of women who had gone before us hadn’t been in vain. Recently, a friend told me that her mother got into Harvard in the 1970s but chose not to go because of the explicit inequalities for women that remained there. “They had a male-only library. She wasn’t allowed to be in the marching band,” she said. My friend felt that her mother was in awe – even jealous – of our condition, apparently freed from that overt discrimination. My friend recalled that she grew up being told: “This is how good you get it. You get to live in this time when everything is possible.”My mother, the nerdy daughter of penniless Polish immigrants, loved literature and music. But, when she applied to college, her father insisted she study science, and she did so, because daddy was still king in the 60s. Defeated, she dropped out. She felt, I think, trailed by the shadow of opportunities denied. Her determination that I not screw up my special opportunity became, at times, overwhelming. When I came home with a B in geometry, I got chewed out as if I had written off the car. When I looked deep into my mother’s eyes, sometimes I thought I saw a plea: tell me you are going to make it.It sounds paradoxical, but all the power we were told we had led often not to courage, but to hesitation, rationalisation, even self-hatred and self-harm. It was portrayed as a liberation to have the chance to be everything all at once, brainy and gorgeous. But in practice, it was crushing: if we could be anything, we had to be ideal.The beauty rituals of the 90s focused on scraping, plucking and driving out. We knew we had to be godly, so we became like monks, obsessed with flaying ourselves and exorcising the evidence of sin within us in the form of stray hairs and blackheads, which we cruelly tried to rip off of our delicate faces with special tape. Our 90s models of beauty – Kate Moss, Posh Spice – were hollow-eyed, so blemishless and skinny that they seemed to be melting away. The beloved teen magazine Seventeen played the role of our advisor on romance, and it was a harsh tutor, reminding us incessantly of all the ways we could fail. One recurring feature was the quiz, dedicated to helping young women identify and root out their neuroticisms. “Quiz: Do You Play Mind Games?”, “Are You Overreacting?”, “Are You Paranoid?” Another feature was “550 Guys on First Moves and the Worst Thing a Girl Could Do”.We were rated on everything. I got graded at summer camp. In high school, we took the Myers-Briggs type-indicator test, which adjudicated our entire personalities and generated quantitative values for our traits we could even be rated on how much we liked to have fun. This was the insidiousness of the decade’s philosophy: in the guise of liberation, it swallowed up everything and directed it towards incessant self-perfection.Educators who work with prodigies know they often become paralysed because any action at all would be a betrayal of the ideal performance. Or they start to sabotage themselves. Many girls I knew began to cut themselves. Young-adult novels began to proliferate in which the teenage protagonists became grievously ill, bedridden, or died. In recalling her thoughts of suicide, the writer Porochista Khakpour described it as the only choice that had not yet proved itself imperfect. In an environment where being extraordinary is never quite enough, being dramatically, pointedly off the mark becomes a way to get attention. A friend of mine and I privately called the girls who cut themselves the “Arrogant Suicidals”. We assumed they were doing it to stand out.It makes me sick to recall that I presumed feeling suicidal could be just another performance. But it might have been, at times, because everything was. The longer everybody tried to be amazing, the harder we all had to look for marks of distinction in paradoxical places.We longed so much to step or fall off the narrow tightropes we walked. In the early days of the internet, a lot of kids my age took a quiz called the “Purity Test”. Among the hundreds of questions were ones such as:“Have you used a drug to lower someone’s inhibitions about sexual activity?”“Have you had sex with a woman who was asleep and she didn’t wake up?”“Have you ever accepted money for sex?”“Have you ever masturbated into a houseplant?”It wasn’t entirely clear whether it was good or bad to get a low score – to be “pure” – but I recall it was judicious to be pure and cool to be impure, and we kind of had to be both.The people who designed the purity test were high achievers: students at MIT. I suspect the test reflected fantasies of getting off the dizzying fast track. But it’s telling, and sad, that their fooling around also yielded a grade. In the end, “impurity” was just another proof of accomplishment. In the test’s logic, prostitution and rape were almost wickedly charming, marks of daredevil extraordinariness. Early on in the iconic 90s film American Beauty, Angela, the movie’s ingenue, fields creepy attention from an older, married man. She converts that problem into a ine opportunity.“If people I don’t even know look at me and want to fuck me, I really have a shot at being a model, which is great!” she says. “Because there’s nothing worse in life than being ordinary.”Years later, in 2014, on a reporting trip to Montevideo, I hosted a dinner for local artists and journalists. One of them gave me the eye across the table. We ended up at a bar. He walked me home to my AirBnB. We went upstairs. I recall these steps as feeling both discomfiting and inevitable, as if someone else was moving my feet. The whole time I walked, I thought brightly: I can always go back.But I couldn’t. My first step towards the AirBnB had arisen from a wish to be fancy-free – but then it became a rule. For if I’d had the power in that situation, then I’d have been able to make the best choice at any given time. To stop walking, to change my mind, was to admit that I had made a mistake, been stupid – a crippling admission.After I let him into my AirBnB, he dropped his pants and blocked the door with his body. Now this was real. This was bad. This was the point at which I was supposed to kick out the brake light of the car to signal the police. But all I could manage was to feebly voice what had become for me, by then, a go-to excuse for ending such encounters: that my vagina was broken. I said it had a “disorder”.Unfortunately, my excuse didn’t work. He just grinned and said: “Maybe mine will be the dick that will fix that for you.” Horrible – but wasn’t that kind of always the hope? That a man would come along and put the last piece into the not-yet-quite-perfect puzzle of our feminine lives?It felt awkward, even childish, to hit him or to scream. I also felt I owed him a long explanation for my inconsistency, even though I had not yet managed to explain it to myself. Suffocating under contradictions, I just lay back and resigned myself. I think so many of us resigned ourselves to situations that were wrong, not because we were powerless, but because we thought this was the way for us to experience our power. To shove the man, or to scream, felt like an admission to myself I had misjudged the situation in the first place, and I’d always been taught that to lose control of a situation was a mark on your character. A failure.I trekked to his office the next morning to return a sweater he’d left behind. He gave me a warm smile, which I returned with a queasy one. I didn’t know what to think of myself, and in that void, I didn’t want to seem inconsistent. I think he thought my solicitousness meant I’d had a good time. And why shouldn’t he have? How could he have known all the fears and concerns I had brought in with me to that AirBnB, when we, as a culture, go so terribly far to conceal them?But I’ve thought of Montevideo during the #MeToo conversation. There are many of these kinds of ambiguous yet heartbreaking encounters that women have not yet voiced. Some commentators have fretted about “evolving standards” – as if all of a sudden women just decided that things they used to be cool with aren’t so cool any more. There is surprise at some of the #MeToo stories – when strong women such as Amy Schumer reveal that they endured abuse, sometimes for years. But it all makes sense to me. We aren’t changing our standards. We are remembering things. Why should we be surprised that women are only now remembering, or understanding, what really happened to them, when, in the time that so many of us came of age, we told ourselves that everything we knew about life and human behaviour could be forgotten, that we had left the past behind?How many times have I recounted a truly scary or hurtful encounter with a man to my girlfriends as a jolly story? But, it turns out, it just isn’t funny or adventurous to see your boss masturbate on a houseplant. It’s traumatic. There are, perhaps, only so many times a woman can deny the impact of such experiences before she loses it. Every one of them dredges up the memories of the others, cumulatively, until one day a stranger whistles at you on the street, or you read an account of some random celebrity’s misdeeds, and you find yourself raving on Twitter like a person who has been halfway destroyed.Yes, some of these experiences are minor. But what’s behind them is not. Love as triumph, love as ruin. Sex as weightless, sex as incredibly freighted. Men as pointless, men as the whole point of life’s game. Women as witches, magicians women so fragile they cut themselves open in high-school bathrooms. Women as careful, women as carefree.In some of the #MeToo critiques, I perceive an anger that younger women weren’t the perfectly empowered people their elders had hoped they would be. The older generation had prepared the ground, after all, and fought their battles. To acknowledge how younger women have struggled would entail a painful admission that the battles of previous generations may not have been won as decisively as they had hoped. We were told, decades ago, that we were starring in a totally new story, and that we didn’t have to experience any of these painful conflicts. But that only made our ultimate experience of them more painful.Nine months after it began, I sense an ebbing of some energy around #MeToo – a tiredness perhaps an acknowledgement that the contradictions and painful realities it revealed are too big to solve fast. Frantically firing offending males may make it harder for women to tell their complex stories. But the suffering of men who have been publicly accused of sexual assault or misconduct must not shut us up now, either. I want more stories. I want more curiosity about the complexity of women’s lives – instead of a panicky retreat from the conversation.We would like to believe that clearer rules around “positive consent” will put an end to much of this difficulty. But I worry a little about “positive consent”. It still puts the onus on the woman to perfectly manage the situation – this time with non-verbal cues, communicating desire or retreat with a flicker of the eye. It wasn’t a better description of “consent” that I needed while growing up. I was taught endlessly what I should and shouldn’t consent to for my life not to go wrong. All that emphasis on all my power to make things turn out right ended up paralysing me.I lacked a perception of what I wanted. I think that’s one of the things that lurks in the shadows of #MeToo. How to enable young people to discover what they really want and need out of love and sex – this is what we should be talking about in sex-education classes. Forget about putting condoms on bananas. But as long as we venerate doing and solving – making things more efficient and perfect – it will be hard to glimpse what we really want out of sex or of love.Main illustration by Nate Kitch• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aeae96c86c8ab2e9e9c4a3bb311eaa45262d1eb/0_0_6097_4065/master/6097.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae73c16b171d9d369787838e33cf9951 700w","title":"study law to open up a world of opportunities","story":"Politician, lecturer, human rights campaigner – a law degree will set you on the path for a career at the top Not only does a law degree or postgraduate course open up a wide variety of careers within the legal sector – it can also set you up for a future career at the top, in anything from business to politics.International law, for example, is a fascinating and fast-moving area. Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc0ac9d17d1e9f81731fcce744a5bab94f9ff647/376_35_1891_1134/master/1891.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c67c41dabfa359662d8316b233a9c7","title":"davis and mcvey up the ante in game of sack me if you dare","story":"Usual rules no longer apply as ministers vie to embarrass themselves and governmentMaybe it’s the hot weather, but for the past few weeks cabinet ministers have been engaged in their own private contest – I’m a Nonentity, Get Me Out of Here! – to see who can come closest to being forced to resign while still remaining in their jobs. Boris Johnson was an obvious early frontrunner until everyone remembered he had the unfair advantage of having no principles whatsoever and he was disqualified on the grounds he was a certifiable sociopath.Since then the field has been far more open, with ministers taking it in turns to embarrass both themselves and the government, something that gets easier by the day as the prime minister’s authority flatlines. The most recent entrant – or to be more precise, re-entrant – is David Davis, a ministerial Captain Mainwaring who has never knowingly found the right end of any stick.While most ministers have been holding fire on rubbishing Theresa May’s facilitated customs arrangement until after Chequers, the Brexit secretary has been determined to get in a pre-emptive strike. Presumably because he doesn’t want to have to flounce out after the meeting and find himself without a ministerial car and relying on one of Chris Grayling’s trains to get him home.Captain Mainwaring hadn’t seen the FCA – he couldn’t be sure it even existed – but he was absolutely certain no one would like it and didn’t mind who knew it. If that was the best the prime minister had got, the cabinet might as well stay at home and watch the football rather than going to Chequers. He may well have been right – the mythical third way is mythical for a reason – but he couldn’t have done more to undermine the prime minister if he’d tried. She could sack him if she thought she was hard enough. It went without saying that she wasn’t.Grayling also wakes up each morning astonished to find he still has a career. His saving grace is that no one expects any more of him than complete failure, so his hopelessness is factored into his job description. The fact that the railways have almost ground to a halt on his watch is taken as proof he has his eye firmly on the ball.Even so, the strain is telling. Though Failing Grayling managed to avoid answering anything directly on the railways at departmental questions – he left all that to Jo Johnson, his unfortunate second-in-command – his nervous tic twitched into life every time someone mentioned the trains. If May had any compassion, Grayling would have been invalided out long ago. But it suits her to keep him lying around as he makes her look marginally less out of her depth.Not to be outdone, Esther McVey has also upped the death-wish ante by misleading parliament on two separate occasions about the findings of a National Audit Office report on universal credit. In normal times, even to do so once would be a sackable offence, but if Brexit is to mean anything it is that the UK is a rogue state, so all the usual rules no longer apply.On Wednesday, the work and pensions secretary had tried to pre-empt disaster by making a non-apology apology as a point of order so that no one had a chance to call her out. A day later she was brought back to the Commons by Labour’s Frank Field to face an urgent question. In his opening remarks, Field effectively said McVey had lied. Normally such language would be deemed unparliamentary, but as everyone did think McVey had lied the Speaker didn’t seek to correct the record.“Er … I did get a letter … er … there I would like to leave this,” said McVey. You bet she would have liked to leave it there. Even a Duracell bunny runs out of power eventually, and McVey was reduced to a hesitant, incoherent wreck, albeit one who was utterly uncontrite. If she has a conscience, she keeps it well hidden.She might have used the wrong words but that didn’t mean she was wrong. And if she had misinterpreted the bit where the NAO had said UC was a disaster then it was one of those things. Besides everyone knew the NAO was rubbish. She was sorry if people had expected her to be sorry but the bottom line was that she wasn’t sorry for anything. Sod the lot of you.A few of the more sycophantic Tories made token offers of support, but the opposition benches piled in. At which point, McVey became delusional. She hadn’t been forced to come to the dispatch box to apologise, she insisted. She had come entirely of her own volition. The urgent question was just a coincidence.The arrogance was as breathtaking as her lack of shame. Not that McVey cared. Her job was safe whatever she did. And that’s all that really mattered. In a post-truth world, any old lies would do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dbe71fff5001bfa21146ce301956c25e40885af/0_239_4883_2929/master/4883.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb952265d84255dd2b8b2288a4abc4b1","title":"research sheds light on mystery of how spiders take flight","story":"Arachnids may use natural electric fields to help them stay airborne for up to hundreds of miles, scientists sayIn October 1832 a young naturalist named Charles Darwin watched with delight as hundreds of tiny spiders dangling from short silk threads floated on to HMS Beagle as the ship made for Buenos Aires.Some scientists said the spiders’ silk thread caught the wind and bore them aloft. But others believed the strands became electrostatically charged and in doing so, allowed the spiders to ride Earth’s natural electric fields.In a new study, scientists at Bristol University weigh in on the issue. They report the first tests of whether electrostatic forces are involved in what aficionados call spider “ballooning”. After a series of experiments performed with spiders in a Faraday cage, they conclude that the creatures can indeed fly on electric fields.When a spider wants to take flight it typically climbs to the top of a plant, tiptoes around, points its abdomen in the air and rapidly ejects up to a metre of silk. In some species, they eject a number of silk strands that spread out like a fan. Either way, in the blink of an eye, the spider is whisked into the air.To capture spiders to study, Erica Morley, who works on sensory biophysics at Bristol, went to a nearby field and set traps in the form of sticks with upturned bottles on the ends. Back at the lab, she introduced the spiders, one by one, to a clear polycarbonate box in a room that doubled as a Faraday cage, meaning it was isolated from the atmospheric electric field.Morley set the box up so she could re-create inside it the kinds of electric fields that are commonly found in nature. On a clear day, the atmosphere’s electric potential might be 120 volts per metre, but it can be tens of times stronger that this when storm clouds gather.When the electric field was off, Morley found that spiders made few attempts to fly off an upright cardboard strip she had put in the middle of the box. But as she ramped up the field, the spiders increasingly took flight. Once aloft, their altitude could then be controlled. “When they take off, you can switch off the electric field and watch them drop, then switch it on and see them rise again,” she said.In further experiments, Morley and Daniel Robert, who studies how organisms sense their environment, bounced laser light off the spiders to reveal how tiny hairs on their legs moved in the presence of electric fields and so helped them to detect them. Together, the findings, reported in Current Biology, suggest that while air currents are surely important for ballooning, spiders may exploit electric fields too.Following Darwin’s voyage on HMS Beagle, scientists have recorded spiders flying for hundreds of miles. They can reach staggering altitudes too, according to some accounts. In 1939, PA Glick, an assistant entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture, published a technical bulletin on the distribution of insects, spiders and mites in the air that claimed to find spiders more than two miles up. Beyond flying, some spiders can skate, and even sail, on water.While Darwin described the spiders’ aerial excursions to HMS Beagle as “inexplicable”, ballooning undoubtedly helps to disperse the creatures. And the sooner they start the better. “Spider egg sacs can contain hundreds of eggs and spiders are cannibalistic, so it’s probably advisable to disperse soon after hatching,” Morley said. “It might not be as reckless as we assume.”•This article was corrected on 5 July.

On a bench opposite the Royal pub and nightclub, Katie and Alicia, both 18, are waiting for a cab home. “We come to Ramsgate because this is where the clubs are, here and Canterbury,” says Alicia. Both are still immaculately made up, despite the early hour and the large number of vodkas and coke the night held. “I fell over in the Royal five times!” says Katie she stands up to reveal the muddy seat of her dress. Alicia looks concerned: “Is my makeup still intact?” she wonders. “I’ve been sick a thousand times …”4.41am The sun rises in a curve of fierce orange and a shroud of pinkish light over the water.

Back on shore, the stalls stand shuttered, the beach empty, the new morning sun reflecting off the windows of the huge, new Wetherspoon’s that opens directly on to the beach.

He enjoys the early-morning shifts. “I love it! It’s the best part of the day!” he says, before he disappears behind the metal gate and along the pontoon. The harbour wall is lined with algae, a joyous, iridescent green.5.50am Outside Cannon’s seafood stall, a car sits with its doors splayed open, a bucket of fish inside. “Half past six, I’ve got to go lobstering!” says Michael Penn. He is busy washing and setting out the bream caught that morning, placing them on the packed ice, next to the prawns and jellied eels.5.54am Anthony, 22, walks past with his dog, Honey. “There’s not that many distractions for her at this time of day,” he says. “And she wakes me up at this time anyway.” Across the street, a man is cleaning the windows of Peter’s Fish Factory – the seafront chippy – using a long pole.6.05am The local Loop bus service has started up. Back outside the Royal, a large truck is collecting the empty bottles. The day is warming and the wind lifting, bringing a briny smell and a golden light across the sands.6.40am On the beach, Martin, 61, has been metal-detecting. “I wish I came out every day, but it’s a couple of times a week,” he says. “It’s a lovely, nice-and-quiet two hours. Someone offered me a cheap metal detector probably 25 years ago – he was hard up, so I bought it. I don’t just do beaches, I’m also in a couple of clubs locally, so I go out at the weekend with them and I record all their finds for the national finds archive – writing them down, weighing and measuring. I’ve found Roman coins, Iron Age coins, medieval stuff. I’ve found bits on the beach I’ve got back to people – jewellery, phones, memory cards …”6.50am Outside Gifts Galore, Derek Rhodes, 72, is putting up flags: Brazil, Wales, a Union Jack. “I’ve had the shop for 20 years,” he says. “It used to be around the corner, but the building started to fall down so I’ve been here for the last five.” He enjoys his days here, right by the beach: “It’s lovely, beautiful friends come every day and have tea – or soup in the winter,” he says. His position opposite Wetherspoon’s has brought a surge in trade. “In November, it was like summertime,” he says. “I’ve never bought so much stock! We’ve sold a lot of England flags lately.”7.28am Two swimmers are out in the waves. One of them – David, 41, a tattooist – emerges slowly from the water and wraps himself in a towel. “I thought I’d be on my own out there,” he says. “My own personal swimming pool! But there’s someone else out there today. I normally go boxing at Golden Gloves, but I do swimming a couple of times a week. It’s beautiful, it’s a good way to clear your head.”8am Down among the boats is Paul, 53, a fisherman. “I’m out at this time most days, taking anglers out on fishing trips. Wait here,” he says, returning with this morning’s daytrippers – including Ian, 50, a carpet-fitter from Rochester, who has headed down here with five friends because they “just fancied a day out fishing”. They are hoping for some skate and will be out for about eight hours. There is a gleam of sun on the green water. “Right! Let’s get fishing!” says Paul. With a heavy clunk of the ropes on the walkway, the boat pulls away softly.8.45am Dawn McIntyre, 55, has just begun her shift, cleaning the showers, toilets and all around the harbour. “They’re generally not too bad,” she says, “because we clean them every day and they have to be immaculate for the mariners who come in. But today … I don’t know if you’ve seen the disabled toilet, but I don’t know what they’ve been doing in there. Holding a foam party, from the looks of things …”8.56am Three men are gathered by the fuel storage of the Thanet Fishermen’s Association, chatting and drinking mugs of tea. Roddy, 59, is delivering fuel – a job he does three or four times a week. “I leave about 4am and pick this up from Essex,” he says of his tanker. “I’ll spend about an hour and a half each time I’m here.” Beside him is Merlin, 49, who runs the fuel company for the commercial vessels. A former fisherman, he took this role when the company began to get busy with the arrival of the wind farm. There are few fishermen out today, he says, “because the weather’s against them. The wind’s a north-easterly we call it a famine wind.” There are days when he misses fishing. “I’ve got to that point where I romanticise it,” he smiles. “I remember the good things.”11.27am Peter’s Fish Factory is bracing itself for the lunchtime rush. Behind the counter, Jamie, 21, is saying how long the queues can run. “In the summer, it’s endless, endless, endless,” he says. Outside, a family of three eat boxes of medium cod and chips, bare-armed and bare-legged – determined, despite the north-easterly, to make the most of the sun.11.45am Michael from Sandwich in Kent is going up in the East Cliff Lift, a listed construction of red brick, with pilasters and architraves and an ornate plaque depicting a dolphin. It carries him up from Harbour Parade to Wellington Crescent. “I’ve never been here before,” he says, as it edges slowly upwards. “I’ve just come for a bit of a stroll. I’ve got nothing else to do.”12.12pm The beach is quiet now. The waves have grown high, bucking against the railings with a soft boom and a flourish of foam.1.14pm At Granville Marina – a parade of houses built partly into chalk cliffs, right by the beach – a couple are cleaning their windows. Jan and John come to their door and explain some of its history: how Ramsgate was the first seaside resort that these houses were once shops for the Granville Hotel on the top. Once, guests would come down Marina Road in their carriages to visit. Their house was home to the coiffeur. “This house has been in the family for 50 years,” says Jan. “It was my aunt’s and she left it to me because I loved it.” They are here semi-permanently now, splitting their time with their home in East Sheen, west London. It is the light they love best. “The sun actually comes up right in front of the window,” says John. “And the light will stay like this till 4pm. And the moon last night was an orange moon.”1.50pm A coachload of Italian schoolchildren arrive for the 2pm tour of the Ramsgate Tunnels – the largest network of civilian wartime tunnels, carved out of the chalk cliffs alongside the beach. Inside, at the cafe counter, two men discuss the merits of the bread pudding.2pm By the ramp to the sands, dressed all in white, is Dave, 77, who moved here last September from Croydon in south London. “People said Ramsgate was beautiful, they said it was out of this world,” he says. “But now it’s just fell to bits. It’s a shame, really. It’s all down to the government. They moved all the rubbish people in and that’s how it’s all deteriorated.”2.06pm At the kiosk on the sands, Jane, 69, and Laura, 19, are selling ice-creams – two Crunchies and a Dream – to three workmen. “We’ve been here about 18 years,” says Jane. “Is that right, Eric?” she calls to her husband, barely visible out the back. “Before that, we were at Dreamland in Margate for 20 years.” Whippy ice-creams are their bestsellers, followed by slush. “We’ve not sold that many today – it’s quiet because of the north-east wind,” she says. Today, they will close about 5pm. Later in the summer, they will stay open as late as 7.30. “It’s not set in stone,” she says. “When the last person comes up for an ice-cream, the shutters come down.”The new Wetherspoon’s along the Parade has changed this stretch of the front. “It doesn’t affect us when it’s sunny, but when it’s cold people who might’ve bought a tea or coffee from us are drawn in there,” she explains. “Quiet times are quieter, is what I’m trying to say. But we get the overflow.”4.25pm From a small cabin on the sands, Tom, a retired firefighter, rents deckchairs and windbreakers and runs a trampoline and a carousel. “I’m here Easter to October and I love it, it’s a great office,” he says. Days like today are not great for business – although it is hot, the wind keeps people away from the shore. “August is the month we make money,” he says. Tom has lived in the area for much of his life. “I was in charge of the fire that burned down all this 20 years ago,” he says, gesturing to the awnings that shield a large stretch of half-begun building work. “It’s the old Pleasurama,” he says. “For the last 15 years, it’s been partially derelict.” He has noticed the demographic changing. “You see a lot of eastern Europeans with a lot of cash to flash around now,” he says. He is looking at buying a place in France. “A watermill outside Limoges, that’s the dream,” he says. “But I’ll need a few good Augusts for that.”4.35pm At a wooden picnic table on the edge of the sand, Emma and Charlotte, both 32, are keeping an eye on their children – they have three each – and catching up on the gossip. They don’t often come down to the beach. “I don’t like the sand – it gets everywhere,” says Emma. “But they love it.” She nods at her children, who are now in the water. “You’d think it would be cheap, but it’s not – I spent £30 on ice-creams, drinks, chips and buckets the other day,” she says.4.52pm Nestling behind a large, striped windbreaker are Annie, 65, Reinhold, 66, Lindsey, 33, Steven, 32, Amy, 10, May, 9, and twins Abby and Katy, 2. They are here as a family, on holiday from Frankfurt. “We love England, we love the beach it’s not too hot and it’s not too cold, there’s a nice breeze and it’s only a seven-hour drive to the ship,” explains Annie, who left Abram in Lancashire for Germany in 1974. When they are not enjoying the beach, they spend their time shopping, “for memorabilia and English things”.5.02pm The sun is still high, but as the day has drawn on and people have finished school and work the beach has grown busier. Pippa, Bethany and Thomas, all 18, and Chloe, 17, are sitting on a step by the sands. They have recently finished their exams and have returned to school today to hand in old textbooks and meet up for a drink. In a few months, they will move away to different cities to start university. “We’re just making the most of the time we have left together, chilling on the beach,” says Pippa.5.35pm A young girl skateboards along the Harbour Arm in shorts and a T-shirt, zig-zagging her way past the fishermen. Meanwhile, in the boot of his car, Potts, 62, lies on a makeshift bed, reading. “I don’t fish, but it’s nice to get out of the house and enjoy life. I chat to everyone – Dutch, Germans, people from all over. I’ll stay and watch the sunset and the people taking pictures.” He pauses and then, unannounced, takes out a didgeridoo and begins playing. “I heard someone playing it once and I liked the sound,” he explains. “One time, when a thick sea mist came down, I started playing and the fishermen over there started wondering what was going on …”7.23pm A gauzy mist has fallen. A man is still fishing off the harbour wall, his daughter crouched at his feet, still in her beachwear, playing Michael Jackson songs on a phone. At this hour, as the light fades, the sky clouds and the fishermen begin to pack up, the gulls’ call sounds more doleful. There are still kite surfers out on the water and children playing on the beach two little girls run across the sand towards the sea line, coats flaring out behind them.7.41pm The day drinkers have moved on now. On the Harbour Parade, the night is revving up. Two bouncers have taken up position outside the Wetherspoon’s at Rokka bar, music spills out on to the pavement.8pm Not far from the harbour sits Lyall, 37, and his dog, Lacey, who live on the streets here. He explains how his other dog, Marley, died three weeks ago. “I used to come down here every Thursday and Friday,” he says. “But when Marley died I was quite depressed.” He has been out of prison for four and a half years, but has struggled to find work and has been homeless for about four months. “There are only about six of us who are actually homeless here,” he says. “The other people are aggressive beggars, heroin addicts, and they bully people.” Yesterday, he was five miles away in Margate. “There’s so many homeless people there sleeping on the beach in tents,” he says. He is on a list for council accommodation, but he does not hold out much hope. “It’s hard with pets,” he says. Not so long ago he was moved along from a spot he had by the waterfall. “Now I sit here because of the cameras, because it’s safe.” Soon, the lighthouse light comes back on, glowing red in the softening night sky.8.40pm Where this afternoon Tom rented deckchairs, a large group of exchange students are now doing the Macarena. When the music fades, Whigfield’s Saturday Night starts up, followed by Lou Bega’s Mambo No 5. Even when the stereo falters, the formation dancing continues. Others play football or leap about on the unattended trampolines. They are here with Churchill House School of English, explains Adwoa Asiedu, 27, one of the group’s activity supervisors. This is a summer job for Asiedu, who is studying for a creative writing MA at Brunel she recently wrote a screenplay called Superstar, “about pursuing your dreams against obstacles”.9.02pm Under the concrete boardwalk are Louise, 20, who works in a nursery, and Matthew, 19, a site supervisor. They are finishing up a barbecue and have spread out a large blanket away from the wind. They look cold, snuggled together in their hoodies. “I was at work and I said let’s go to Aldi and get some bits,” says Louise. “Even though it’s cold, we were like: ‘Let’s brave it! We can take jackets!’”10.03pm The lights have come on in the boats and in the neon of the restaurants along the top of the cliff. Near the harbour office, Philip Louis, 51, a bar manager, is walking home after a night out “pubbing”. Tomorrow, he will take his teenage children to Bruges in Belgium. As he heads off, he points out a fox, pressed against the wall of the Sailors’ Church.11.15pm There is a high, bright moon now. At the Queen’s Head, a cover band is playing Get Lucky. A young couple stands entwined by the shuttered seafood stall, kissing. A car pulling a boat moves quietly out of the harbour and along towards the main road. “You’re not in control!” one girl tells her friend as they sway towards the front. “You gave some mad guy your number!”11.30pm Back at the Royal, Brad the doorman, 24, leans in the doorway checking his phone. “Friday’s always the worst night,” he says. “It’s notoriously quiet. Thursdays are heaving. It’s £1 a pint and last night it was the football.” But even on the busiest nights, he says, there is rarely trouble. “It’s always just a bit boisterous,” he says. “It’s never anything serious.”11.45pm Out to sea is the blinking of lights, the sound of the waves. The back of the lifeguard shelter is lit up by the light of the Wetherspoon’s.12.01am A National Express coach pulls up. A couple make their way down to the pontoon. In Enoteca, a live band is covering the Cranberries’ Zombie as the crowd dances and sings along. “With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns …” the crowd sings. “In your head, in your head, they are crying …”12.09am Two passengers alight from the last Loop bus. The lights go off in its belly and it sails off up the hill, leaving the front to find its morning once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e0d7ed4126f9ff31b0914114628300cb98c586/41_36_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f708d2fc6ec76dde8863f55662b015ab","title":"thousands of uk workers owed back pay worth 144m official figures show","story":"Odeon cinema chain, Card Factory and 10 sports clubs among more than 200 employers failing to pay national minimum wageTen professional sports clubs, the Odeon cinema chain and the Navy, Army and Air Force Institute (Naafi) have been named and shamed by the government as being among more than 200 employers that have failed to pay workers the national minimum wage.About 22,400 UK workers were owed back pay worth £1.44m as a result of the underpayments – a record number of people found by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs to have fallen victim to illegally low pay.Employers in social care and in hospitality and catering were most likely to underpay their staff, according to the annual list published on Friday by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In social care, 22 providers underpaid 580 workers, while 70 hospitality and catering companies underpaid 612 workers.The national minimum wage is £7.83 for people aged over 25, £7.38 for those between 21 and 24 and £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds. As well as enforcing repayments, the HMRC levied record fines on employers of £1.97m.Football league clubs Bristol City, Doncaster Rovers, Dundee, Port Vale and Northampton Town together underpaid 150 workers. The Super League rugby club Huddersfield Giants underpaid 24 workers by £7,800. The county cricket clubs Durham, Derby and Sussex also underpaid staff, as did Newcastle Falcons, the premiership rugby team. Bristol City fell foul because it had not paid some of its academy players for travel time to away fixtures. The Naffi, which runs restaurants and shops for servicemen and women, underpaid 60 staff by almost £20,000.The biggest culprit was Card Factory, which underpaid more than 10,000 shop workers by a total of £430,000. The Yorkshire-based cards, gifts and party supplies company said it had apologised to the staff, paid them back and changed its pay policies.The most common reasons for failing to pay properly were that companies were taking deductions from wages for costs such as uniforms, were underpaying apprentices and were failing to pay travel time, which has been an ongoing problem in the social care sector.The Odeon and UCI Cinema Group failed to pay £4,438.92 to 237 workers, with average arrears of £18.73 per worker.The figures showed that “minimum wage underpayment is happening on an industrial scale”, said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady.HMRC has increased the number of enforcement officers from 150 in 2010 to 405 now. The business minister, Andrew Griffiths, said: “Our priority is making sure workers know their rights and are getting the pay they worked hard for. Employers who don’t do the right thing face fines as well as being hit with the bill for backpay.“The UK’s lowest paid workers have had the fastest wage growth in 20 years thanks to the introduction of the national living wage and today’s list serves as a reminder to all employers to check they are getting their workers’ pay right.”Self-employed workers such as drivers for Uber or delivery couriers for firms including Hermes, Deliveroo and DPD are not entitled to the minimum wage. However, Hermes and Uber have lost employment tribunal cases in rulings that decided some self-employed contractors were workers and so entitled to the minimum wage. Deliveroo settled one such case out of court last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8677100c018a20ee8ac78fe13393959d5df1e3d7/443_130_4131_2479/master/4131.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e18437428a405563d3d09ba838ffe835","title":"padraig harrington irish open","story":"• Irishman makes nonsense of Open odds• Rory McIlroy signs for a 70How Padraig Harrington would revel in the disproving the old adage Bookmakers are never wrong. It would not be wise to utter such sentiment within earshot of the three-times major champion.Harrington’s opening round of 68, four under par, at the Irish Open left him one shot off the pace set by Ryan Fox. The target for Fox is clear he is seeking a spot in the Open. “Carnoustie is one of the best courses in the world and I’d love the chance to play there in an Open,” the New Zealander said.In a country where sports betting is never far removed from general conversation, pre-tournament odds ranging from 60-1 to 80-1 had not been lost on Harrington. It was easy to infer they may even have motivated him.“There’s not often there’s value in my game,” Harrington, currently ranked 268 in the world, said. “The bookies in Ireland would make sure they cut you to a low price knowing that sentimentally people would back you.“I was surprised, but to put me out there at 66 to 1 on a links course was strange at their part, in my home country. My performances always go up when it comes to a links course.” A smile followed from the 46-year-old. “Maybe that says I’m even worse than I thought.”As Harrington set about rewarding his loyal backers, Rory McIlroy’s Open preparations enjoyed a timely boost. In the most fiery of the day one conditions, McIlroy signed for a 70. His scorecard would have been significantly better but for missed opportunities on the greens. “For the most part I felt like I hit good putts, they just didn’t go in,” he said. “I have got to take the positives that’s as well as I’ve hit the ball in a long time. This is the first time I’ve putted on links greens in a while. They are a lot more subtle than what I’ve been playing on in the US.”Lee Westwood matched Harrington’s score. The defending champion, Jon Rahm of Spain, returned a disappointing 74, while Graeme McDowell’s 71 included a second nine of 33."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db5a4520e49c23933926e6fe817a981c6614f09/0_145_4215_2530/master/4215.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fef17c4a2f50b296760a5712b492c18","title":"sebastian vettel british grand prix lewis hamilton f1","story":"Smiling, relaxed and visibly at ease from the moment he sits down, Sebastian Vettel’s demeanour betrays no hint of a driver engaged in a mighty struggle with Lewis Hamilton for the Formula One world championship.Their rivalry may well become the defining battle of this generation but it clearly does not weigh heavily with Vettel. Just how composed he is could not be better illustrated than when this intensely private man proves happy to talk about his life away from the wheel. Something that perhaps helps define why he has been so successful behind it.Vettel goes into Sunday’s British Grand Prix one point clear of Hamilton. Both have four world championships apiece. Both want to be the one to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s tally with a fifth. Their battle, and how it plays out, will be the dominant theme at Silverstone.It is the second season in a row Vettel has been in a two-horse race with Hamilton and the Ferrari driver understands and revels in the excitement it has generated. “It is something you want, you want to be in close rivalry,” he says. “You want to be in a position so you can fight for victory, that is the ultimate satisfaction, of course it is more intense when it is closer.”Yet much as this is important to the 31-year-old, he is equally as concerned that behind the intensity, he remains, well, simply, himself. “Obviously F1 is a big part of my life but it is not the most important\u0026nbspthing. It is not who I am, it is what I do. They are linked but it is important there is a lot of time where it doesn’t define who I am.”Clearly this distinction means something to Vettel, who has enjoyed huge success, with four titles for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. “I don’t feel special because of what I do for a job. It is part of me, my identity but it would be the wrong answer if I asked myself: ‘Who are you?’ and I said: ‘I am an F1 driver.’ I am a lot of other things as well. It doesn’t define me as a person.”At which point he opens up further. He has two children and yes they have been to races but only in the grandstands and not in the paddock. He is focused on them seeing him as who he is rather than what he does. It is the tip of the iceberg in his desire not be changed by F1. “I am happy to do things that people think are boring but for me they are not, being at home, mowing the lawn. I cook, not so good, but from time to time. I do the school run, I go shopping, I take the metro and the bus.”The contrast with Hamilton’s jet-set lifestyle could not be more pronounced but for Vettel pursuing his quiet pleasures seems more important than anything. Visits to the cinema, galleries and museums are all accommodated when possible but he has a blunt appraisal of his fame.“I am sportsman, I am not celebrity. So when I go somewhere and somebody recognises me I think they are interested in sport and not in how I do my hair, or which shoes I am wearing or that bollocks.”He and Hamilton are very much contemporaries. Both made their debuts in 2007 and Vettel is only two\u0026nbspyears younger than Hamilton, but these past two years are the first time they have really gone head to head in equally matched cars. There is nothing to choose\u0026nbspbetween them this season. The lead has changed hands between them five times in the past nine races\u0026nbspand doubtless will do again before it is over.The pair have been open in their oft-repeated mutual respect for one another, and their relationship\u0026nbspremains friendly. Their flashpoint in Baku last year when Vettel barged Hamilton has been put behind them. The German now says it was a “reaction” which he concedes was wrong, unnecessary, and which he would not repeat. “I wasn’t intending to hurt him, or end his race, or my race,” he says.Vettel has, however, also been accused of too much ambition, leading to errors. This season, his dash at Valtteri Bottas in both Baku and France proved costly as it did on the start in Singapore last year. Yet there is a verve to his driving that can be breathtaking. As it was when he took to the grass to pass Hamilton in Austria. A move similar to his extraordinary overtake on Fernando Alonso round the outside of Curva Grande at Monza in 2011. But he insists he is calm regardless of the situation.“People would be surprised. They have the image that drivers under the helmet are all ‘Arggh’. You have to be calm in the way you drive because it takes all your concentration. But of course I am excited at times and feel the adrenalin.”His battle with Hamilton has been fascinating as has been the apparent determination of both drivers to steer away from attempting to score cheap points from one another. It seems this civilised approach is just another facet of Vettel’s determination to keep his real persona intact amid the sound and fury of the sport.He compliments Hamilton, saying: “he has great talent, he has great skill in the car,” but interestingly declines to be drawn on Hamilton’s strengths or weaknesses, simply unwilling for anything to be misconstrued or interpreted in the wrong way.For Vettel, this seems perfectly natural, his consideration a fundamental part of maintaining his balance out of the car, ensuring the intensity, the emotion, the focus is there when required behind the wheel.“I think it’s just normal to be normal,” he says, still smiling, still relaxed as the pressure cooker of Silverstone beckons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45e4a8e2eaec8265de1ebd6f8e8efb40e617139c/6_642_2561_1536/master/2561.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eb609b9b813211b78c026d871e9e502","title":"team sky tour de france rival education first chris froome jonathan vaughters","story":"Jonathan Vaughters, the manager of the Education First team of last year’s Tour de France runner-up, Rigoberto Urán, has voiced his concerns at the threats being directed towards Chris Froome.Armed police are patrolling team hotels and have been a presence at the Team Sky and Education First hotels in the past 48 hours. Extra security was introduced at the Tour following terrorist attacks in France, but Team Sky also called in security experts from BSkyB to advise on extra measures. “It is really concerning,” Vaughters said of his anxieties over crowd control. “The amount of vitriol and anger directed at Sky is pretty impressive. The barriers need to go further down the mountain climbs, but you can’t barrier 200 kilometres of open road.”Vaughters, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, was a pivotal witness in the Usada investigation that exposed Armstrong’s systemic doping programme. Yet he is among the growing numbers within cycling who have attacked the lack of confidentiality in the Froome matter.“In this case, it was public, which is really unfortunate and whoever leaked it — because somebody inside the UCI leaked it — it’s just nasty, vindictive behaviour to do that,” he said. “It doesn’t actually allow the system to work in the way that it should in a case involving a restricted substance, as opposed to a banned substance.”Although under normal circumstances the athlete in such a case would be expected to undergo a controlled pharmacokinetic study, this was not insisted on by Wada in Froome’s case.But despite an onslaught of criticism of Wada’s procedures, Vaughters remains supportive of the anti-doping body. “I don’t think Wada is broken. The people involved in anti-doping are incredibly passionate about fairness to athletes.“I’ve been saying for years that cycling should be throwing more money into anti-doping. I think it’s €140,000 that each team contributes to the biological passport, but that’s like a minuscule amount of Team Sky’s budget. Each team should be spending more like five per cent of its total budget on anti-doping.”Vaughters insisted cycling has cleaned up its act, despite many believing that little has changed since the Festina affair of 1998.“That’s just not reality,” he said. “I can say that all day long, but nobody’s going to believe it. It’s not true and I think anyone inside the sport with any genuine knowledge is going to say that’s not true. Unfortunately many people look at us all sceptically.But Vaughters joined those who now think that all relevant details to the case should be made public, despite both Team Sky and Wada declining to do so. “It shouldn’t have been leaked in the first place, but it was, so live with it and now release all the information.

It connects to iOS and Android phones through Bluetooth, and uploads its data to a companion app, also branded UP. But in 2017, after a run of bad financial results, the company liquidated its assets, and earlier this year it disabled the app entirely.That left existing Jawbone Up users unable to carry on using their fitness tracker, sparking hundreds of complaints on social media. But it also pre-emptively broke unsold products, despite the fact that they were still on shelves across the country.Until Which drew attention to it, Selfridges was selling two models of the Jawbone Up2 for £89.99, and Amazon was selling a large selection of devices made by the company. Although they have been removed for sale from the UK site, Amazon’s US branch continues to sell Jawbone devices, including a cut-price version of the UP2 for just $19.97 – a steal, if the device still worked.Amazon UK, Selfridges and Groupon all removed the Jawbone devices from sale after being contacted by Which. Selfridges added that the tracker hadn’t actually been in stock when it was advertised for sale on the site. Jawbone Health, a successor company to Jawbone that bought many of its assets in the liquidation sale, said that Jawbone trackers haven’t been officially distributed or sold in the UK for at least two years.“Retailers have a responsibility to ensure that products listed on websites or sold in stores are fully functional,” said Alex Neill, Which’s managing director of home products and services. “This is especially relevant to products that include a digital component that’s vital to operation, which is typically the case with wearables.“It’s important for all retailers to ensure that suppliers keep them fully informed of any issues that customers might have and take appropriate steps where necessary to ensure that consumers are not inconvenienced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72cf11beea98c5ac5d424e98197e5f580048e5b/0_262_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa6ffea7158dfc272d2cff17c86dc5e5","title":"what should i do about all the gdpr pop ups on websites","story":"Barbara is constantly being interrupted by pop-ups about the new GDPR. Is there anything she can do?Because of GDPR, it feels as though my internet access – my access to information – is now more restricted. I am constantly being interrupted by pop-ups that want me to agree to the website’s privacy policy, use of my data and so on, in order to “personalise my experience”. After recent revelations about unauthorised use of personal data, I’m wary of agreeing without checking what their proposals are, but I often just close the page because there are too many options and it’s too much of a bother. Am I being too paranoid? BarbaraThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) only came into force on 25 May and it will take a while for some websites to adapt. Breaking the rules can result in fines of up to €20m, so at this point, information providers are probably more paranoid than you are.Despite having two years’ warning, some companies were not prepared for GDPR’s arrival. Tronc, a giant American publisher, blocked access to the Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel and many other papers. A message says: “Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market.”Lee Enterprises, which owns 46 daily newspapers and more than 300 other publications, has taken the same approach. Try to read the Arizona Daily Star and you get an error message that says it is “Unavailable due to legal reasons”. The rubric explains: “We recognise you are attempting to access this website from a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) including the EU which enforces the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and therefore access cannot be granted at this time.” This demonstrates that, thanks to GDPR, your access to information really is being restricted. A few US sites may even decide that compliance costs more than EU residents are worth, but I expect most will become available again soon.Of course, the GDPR does not prevent websites from serving information, including advertisements. Nor does it prevent them from collecting data or using cookies – small text files stored on your devices – if these are needed to provide services. For example, log-in cookies don’t need a notice. Sites only require active consent to use information for other purposes, such as targeted advertising and marketing.Targeted advertising is based on tracking and profiling users. It’s why I see ads for foreign holidays, financial investments and funeral services rather than dating sites, payday loans and job opportunities in the armed services. Websites allow it because advertisers demand it.The European Union\u0027s new stronger, unified data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into force on 25 May 2018, after more than six years in the making.GDPR will replace the current patchwork of national data protection laws, give data regulators greater powers to fine, make it easier for companies with a one-stop-shop for operating across the whole of the EU, and create a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board.The new laws govern the processing and storage of EU citizens\u0027 data, both that given to and observed by companies about people, whether or not the company has operations in the EU. They state that data protection should be both by design and default in any operation.GDPR will refine and enshrine the right to be forgotten laws as the right to erasure, and give EU citizens the right to data portability, meaning they can take data from one organisation and give it to another. It will also bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed, and ensure that it can be withdrawn at any time.Some websites decided they could comply with the GDPR by removing trackers and the ads they served. USA Today, for example, now provides a “European Union Experience” that “does not collect personally identifiable information or persistent identifiers from, deliver a personalised experience to, or otherwise track or monitor persons reasonably identified as visiting our site from the European Union.”USA Today’s EU site has no ads and no clutter, and it’s very fast. A typical page is roughly 300K instead of 3MB. It shows how nice the web could be without the ads.We’re suffering from a rash of pop-ups because the system is new, but this should be temporary. Once you have selected your preferences, they will be saved in a cookie for future reference. This is an imperfect solution because you will have to repeat the consent procedure for each browser you use, and repeat it again if you have a clean-up and delete all your cookies.The pop-ups are complicated because the GDPR wants specific consent for specific purposes, not blanket acceptances. For example, OneTrust’s consent utility has sections for strictly necessary cookies (needed for the site to work), performance and analytics cookies, functional cookies (for extra services, such as live chat), and targetingmarketing cookies. That’s a good minimum.Fortunately, many sites seem to have adopted off-the-shelf consent utilities and templates rather than writing their own, so you should soon get used to them.One system says “We value your privacy” and offers a choice between “I accept” and “Change consent”. Click to change consent and you’ll get a list of choices (personalisation, measurement etc), but they are all set to “Off”. Simply click the “Save \u0026amp Exit” button and you’ve finished.Another common pop-up thanks you for visiting the site, tells you about data collection and tracking, and offers buttons labelled “Manage your choices” and “Got it, thanks!” In this case, you should choose to manage your choices because they are all tuned on by default. You may want to turn off some of or all the options before clicking “Save and exit”.In some cases, there are too many advertising-related trackers to turn them off inidually. Fortunately, there are ways to use these sites without consenting.The simplest is to read the cache. Google and other search engines may keep copies of pages they have indexed. If so, you can usually read the cached page instead of going to the site.An even better method is to use your browser’s private or incognito mode. Firefox calls it private browsing. In this case, you can accept everything because all the information including cookies from the site is discarded when you close the private browsing window. (You can set many browsers so they always use private browsing.)There are drawbacks. Private browsing modes will not save passwords or keep you logged in, will not add sites to the history section so you can find them again, and will not save anything you type into forms for re-use later.A third way to avoid GDPR pop-ups is to pretend you are not in Europe. You can do this by routing your internet access via a server in a different country, such as the US or Japan.This sounds geeky but it’s actually common. People use anonymous proxy servers to access, for example, Netflix from countries it doesn’t cover. British holiday-makers and ex-pats often use proxy servers to watch BBC iPlayer from outside the UK.For a good description of how proxies work, see Hide Your Real IP Address Behind a Proxy.It’s even more common to use a VPN to protect your data when using public hotspots or wifi in hotels. The VPN encrypts traffic between your computer and its own server so that snoopers can’t read it. Large VPN providers have servers in many different countries, and usually have several in the US. Choose one of those, and sites that derive your location from your IP address will think you are in the US, not in Europe.The drawback is that you will get all the usual cookies stored on your PC, without the opportunity to refuse them. In fact, Ghacks has suggested that Americans could use a VPN with a European server to get the same treatment as EU citizens.The current system is a mess. People end up with thousands of cookies that are hard to manage, even with the help of browser extensions such as EditThisCookie, Cookie AutoDelete and CookieBro for Chrome or others. And while nobody likes tracking, the fact is that targeted advertising is how most users pay for most free websites.But before getting too paranoid, remember that reputable companies are not actually selling your data. That would be giving away the farm. They’re selling the ability to target large groups of people (selected by age, estimated income, family status, homecarother ownership, special interests etc) with adverts that might influence their purchasing decisions.No doubt there are some unscrupulous companies as well. They are the ones that should be caught by the GDPR.Have you got a question?

Southern right whales used to be a common sight in Wellington harbour, but 150 years of whaling from the 17th century brought them to the brink of extinction.Known as Tohora in New Zealand, the whales were targeted because of their propensity to swim close to the shore, their huge quantities of flesh and approachability.According to the Department of Conservation, the whales are now rare in New Zealand waters, with DOC urging the public to help with their conservation by reporting any sightings. “Your help is urgently sought to look out for tohora around New Zealand and to report sightings immediately,” a plea on its website reads.The whale currently making its home in Wellington harbour – less than a kilometre as the crow flies from parliament house – is quickly becoming a favourite with locals, who have described it as “iconic”, “beautiful” and “majestic” . During the breeding season in the southern hemisphere’s winter and spring southern right whales are usually found in the sub-Antarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands, so the appearance of the creature in the capital’s harbour is unusual. DOC has urged people to stay 50m clear of the whale, but some locals have taken paddle boards and row boats to get a closer look.Wellington’s council – which is considering cancelling a NZ$200,000 harbour fireworks display on Saturday night in case it disturbs the visitor – said Wellingtonians had fallen in love with the whale, and did not want it harmed in any way.“We at Wellington city council are waiting on some advice from experts at the New Zealand Department of Conservation re whether the sound of exploding fireworks will be harmful to the whale if it’s in the vicinity of the fireworks display tomorrow night,” said media manager Richard MacLean. “This morning the whale was again seen breaching and frolicking in the harbour – and we’re getting lots of ‘save the whale’ sentiment from local people who’ve been captivated by its antics over the past few days. “We’ve had traffic coming to a standstill on the motorway and other harbourside roads ... the whale is making everyone very happy and work in many offices has been disrupted by whale-watching.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555609.1530816964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hosepipe ban to go nationwide as drought conditions persist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOffaly Fire and Rescue Service shared an image on its Facebook page of a baby fawn that was rescued from a fire in the  Slieve Bloom Mountains  on Wednesday.Irish Water’s hosepipe ban is to be extended nationwide on Friday with fewer than 20 domestic users having been reported for water misuse since the measure came into force in the greater Dublin region on Monday.

Belmullet weather station in Co Mayo was the exception. An “absolute drought” is defined as 15 or more consecutive days of less than 0.2mm of rainfall.The dry weather has prompted Irish Water to extend its hosepipe ban nationwide from 8am on Friday. Irish Water warned the ban would likely remain in place until at least July 31st.Those found flouting the ban can be fined €125 and prosecuted if they fail to pay the fine. Irish Water said the measure had helped to reduce demand from 615 million litres a day to 578 million litres.Kate Gannon, Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager, said it would “take weeks and months” for water sources to recover from the dry spell. “We have seen a reduction in demand and we would like to see that continue over the coming weeks,” she said.Despite the warnings, supermarket chain Lidl said its 7,500 litre swimming pools had sold out within hours of going on sale on Thursday.“Unfortunately due to unprecedented demand the above item has sold out much quicker than we could have anticipated,” it said. “Stock for this promotion was bought and the sales date planned nearly a year in advance.“Whilst we apologise to customers who have been disappointed, we would ask customers to be respectful towards our employees who have no control over availability.”In response to queries from The , a spokeswoman for Irish Water said less than 20 domestic users have been reported for water misuse.“Irish Water continues to review the situation and asks that everyone, including commercial entities, are mindful of their water usage,” she said.“The water conservation order relates to domestic customers only but again we will continue to review this in conjunction with reviewing the weather situation in the coming days and weeks.”Irish Water also said it was making two tanker trips per day to Inis Oirr off the west coast as the volume of visitors meant the population was increasing on summer weekends from the usual 150 to some 2,000.The conditions have led to the outbreak of wildfires in many parts of the State. Coillte said fires were tackled on Thursday in the Slieve Bloom Mountains in LaoisOffaly, where a large area was burned after a blaze spread into a forest from open moorland.Offaly Fire and Rescue Service shared an image on its Facebook page of a baby fawn that was rescued from the Slieve Bloom blaze on Wednesday.There was also a “significant fire” in Kildalkey, Co Meath, as well as others in the Dublin Mountains. Following a request from civil authorities, the Air Corps said it responded to requests for assistance in Dublin, Wicklow, Limerick, Cork, Tipperary and Offaly. It dropped approximately 300,000 litres of water using specialised equipment.Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters were utilised as they can be equipped with a “Bambi” bucket aerial firefighting system capable of dropping 1,200 litres of water per pass.“This amount of water, concentrated in small areas, makes an immediate impact on wildfires,” it said. “These operations are ongoing and the Defence Forces are prepared to continue firefighting operations in support of our communities.”Irish Water Safety, Coast Guard and RNLI issued a joint appeal reminding the public to stay alert to the risk of drowning.

Photograph: Lorraine TeevanThe vast majority of the country officially enters a state of “absolute drought” today with no rainfall recorded at 24 out of 25 weather stations during the last two weeks.The extreme weather conditions have prompted Irish Water to expand a hosepipe ban from the Greater Dublin Area to the whole\u0026nbsp country from Friday morning.From 8am on Friday the use of hoses in nearly all circumstances will be banned across the country. Irish Water warned the ban will likely continue until at least July 31st in order to allow water sources to replenish themselves.The hot dry spell is expected to continue for the foreseeable future with Met Éireann saying it does not expect any rainfall within the next 10 days.On average, demand across all water resources nationally has increased by 15 per cent, a level Irish Water said “cannot be sustained for any period of time”.An absolute drought is defined as 15 or more consecutive days of less than 0.2mm of rainfall. The weather station at Belmullet, Co Mayo, is the only one of the State’s 25 stations to record any rainfall in the last two weeks, though some brief showers were reported in Munster yesterday evening.Senior meteorologist John Eagleton said there would be “practically nothing” in terms of rainfall for the next 10 days, the maximum time period for which Met Éireann can make predictions.Yesterday, temperatures hit a maximum of 23 degrees, with the midlands experiencing the warmest conditions. The weekend will see temperatures of up to 30 degrees, “a notch below” those seen last week, according to Mr Eagleton.The average top temperatures will be around 27 or 28 degrees. Humidity levels will remain low meaning the heat will not be clammy or sticky, he said.High demand combined with high levels of evaporation caused by the uninterrupted sunlight has caused significant depletion of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, some of which may take months to recover, Irish Water said.The ban covers the use of hoses to water gardens, wash cars or fill paddling or swimming pools. Households ignoring the ban can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they fail to pay the fine.A hosepipe ban introduced in the Greater Dublin Area on Monday has helped reduce demand from 615 million litres a day to 578 million litres.Engineers Ireland warned yesterday periodic water shortages will continue in Dublin unless water is pumped over from the river Shannon. Water resources are “inadequately maintained, unable to meet peak demand and requiring significant investment”, the group warned in a report.Yesterday parents were told to take “extreme care” in protecting their children from the sun’s harmful rays during the heatwave. The Marie Keating Foundation cancer support group said infants and children should be kept out of the sun between 11am and 3pm and factor 50 sunscreen should be applied every two hours.The Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has said it has received numerous reports of animals being trapped in the heat including about 30 horses tied up in fields with no access to shade and water.

There is also renewed interest in stanozolol as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and weight loss associated with chronic disease.However, stanozolol is the drug associated with some famous doping incidents in sport. Canadian Ben Johnson’s victory in the 100m at the 1988 Olympics was reversed after he was found to have run with the benefit of the performance-enhancing drug in his system. Records of the doping programme in the former German Democratic Republic confirmed its widespread use in athletes.The inidual hazard to a person’s health as a result of taking stanozolol is dependent on their sex, the dose, and the duration of administration. Inidual susceptibility to androgen exposure is thought to be linked to genetic factors, age and lifestyle.The main side effects of stanozolol include fluid retention, liver damage-hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests occur at relatively low doses – and a risk of developing liver cancer.In females the use of anabolic steroids may result in a deepening voice, hirsutism, acne, enlargement of the clitoris, and menstrual abnormalities.Blood clotting factors are also interfered with, while anabolic steroids can have a negative effect on electrolyte balance and calcium excretion.Congestive heart failure may occur, while there is a significant increase in the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in some people taking performance-enhancing drugs.Stanozolol also causes nausea and vomiting.It and other anabolic steroids are readily available on the internet. There is a culture of invulnerability among some adolescents, which when combined with the online influence of “steroid gurus” can easily portray a false sense of security in those using the drugs.The situation is not helped by how little outward bodily alteration is associated with certain products: enlargement of the male breast, severe acne and hirsutism are not usually seen. Indeed the abuse may only be detectable on physical examination by a doctor or by testing urine for traces of the drug.Another major risk in purchasing anabolic steroids online is that they may be adulterated with other harmful substances which pose a separate risk to health."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555722.1530831805!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of cervicalcheck inquiry criticises hse over delays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: said it is “not acceptable” Dr  Gabriel Scally is facing resistance from State bodies.

Anyone who is not co-operating with him is not co-operating with Government. I don’t think I can be any more clear on this,” he told reporters.The inquiry was launched after it emerged a review of the cases of 209 women diagnosed with cervical cancer concluded they should have received earlier medical intervention.It emerged on Thursday the number of women affected by the cervical cancer controversy had increased to 221 from 209. It was also revealed that the planned review of about 3,000 smear test slides had yet to start, despite Government pledges it would be completed by the end of May.Meanwhile, the Government has approved new legislation, the Patient Safety Bill, to introduce mandatory open disclosure in respect of serious patient safety incidents.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe retirement has been announced by the Courts Service of Kerry-based district justice James O’Connor, following a decision not to grant his application to stay on the bench for another year.Judge O’Connor (66), who presided over District 17, has been on sick leave since January. He had been due to retire when he turned 65 last July, but he served an extra year “ as allowed under statute”, the Courts Service said.Under section 2 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) 1949, a committee, made up of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General can by majority – and after consultation with the Minister for Justice – allow a District Court judge to remain in office until the age of 70.They must also satisfy themselves as to medical fitness, under the provisions. Judge O’Connor had applied this year for a further year in office, and had gone for interview last week, but this was refused, it is understood. The judge, a native of Glencar, near Killorglin, was appointed to the bench in 1998 by then minister for justice John O’Donoghue, a Kerry TD.His first assignment was to District 18, where he covered the courts of Macroom, Millstreet and west Cork. In 2005 he was appointed judge over his native county, which included courts in Killorglin, Cahersiveen, Killarney, Tralee, Listowel, Dingle and Kenmare. During his time on the bench in Kerry, his application of the court poor box in lieu of or in mitigation of conviction was widespread and much time was taken up with bids until the acceptable amount was given the nod. Different offences attracted different contributions, but local solicitors understood the pricing system and knew the level to start with. Speeding “boy racers” regularly had to pay €3,000 to get leniency. A minor cannabis possession would fetch €400-€500 for a strike-out. So much cash was being taken in at one stage, court clerks who had to count it and convey it to central offices raised security concerns. In 2016 nearly €1.5 million was paid in poor-box donations nationally: Kerry alone accounted for €400,000 of that figure, and 90 per cent of the money collected went to a series of overseas charities.The Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae paid a warm tribute to Judge O’Connor, saying he was sorry he was retiring.“I am very sorry to see Judge O’Connor going off the bench because, being from a rural community himself, he had a great understanding of the issues and the problems people had in life particularly coming from rural areas, be they rural isolation, unemployment, depression.“When you have someone sitting in judgment of people, you need them to be able to look at the complete picture, and I believe that Judge O’Connor was very capable in that regard,” Mr Healy-Rae said.He wished the judge and his family every good health and happiness in his retirement, the TD added.Danny Healy-Rae, who had defended the use of the court poor box, also paid tribute to Judge O’Connor."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555735.1530824349!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman may be seeking nomination to run for presidency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Joan Freeman: A number of TDs from the rural technical group confirmed they are willing to back her if she decides to run for president.

Photograph: Sean GallupEPATheresa May has urged her cabinet to take “another step forward” towards a Brexit deal when they gather in Chequers today, as hardline backbenchers warned against remaining too closely aligned with the European Union. The Irish Government expects that Friday’s meeting, billed as decisive on the UK’s approach to leaving the EU, will see Ms May definitively signal a clear move towards a soft Brexit. However, sources in Dublin stress they will wait to see what happens in Chequers. Previous signals from London that Ms May was going to take on the hard Brexiteers in her Cabinet have only led to disappointment in Dublin. “Extreme caution on our side” was how one senior source described it.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said a leaked proposal for regulatory alignment to be discussed at Chequers would turn Britain into a vassal state, as Downing Street denied that the plan would make a trade deal with the United States impossible.The Spectator reported on Thursday that a document circulated to ministers proposes that “the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food” and would make “an up-front choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods”. The document says that the deal “would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal” as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s “array of standards”.The prime minister’s official spokeswoman rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion that Britain would be unable to negotiate a trade deal with the US, whose president Donald Trump visits the country next week.On Thursday, Brexit secretary David Davis declined to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels. The “facilitated customs arrangement” would see Britain leave the EU’s common external tariff arrangement. But all goods entering the UK would be tracked and charged the EU tariff if they are destined for Europe. Though officials in Dublin said they would wait for the outcome of today’s meeting, the Irish Government has been encouraged by meetings the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney held with a series of UK ministers in London on Wednesday. It was strongly signalled to Mr Coveney that Ms May realises there is no majority in Westminster for a no-deal Brexit, sources said. But Irish sources expressed concern that Ms May’s anticipated move would be unacceptable to Brussels, and interpreted the prime minister’s visit to Berlin on Thursday as an effort to ensure that the EU does not reject the British initiative out of hand.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a suggestion by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz that Brexit negotiations could be extended after next March’s deadline would “create more uncertainty”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: NYTThe United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has resigned amid a series of ethics scandals.US president Donald Trump said he had accepted Mr Pruitt’s resignation. EPA deputy administrator Andrew Wheeler will now take over the top position in an acting capacity, the president tweeted.Mr Pruitt had been hailed as a hero among conservatives for his zealous deregulation, but he could not overcome numerous ethics questions about his alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists. Mr Pruitt also came under fire for enlisting aides to obtain special favors for him and his family, such as reaching out to the chief executive of Chick-fil-A, Dan T Cathy, with the intent of helping Mr Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn, open a franchise of the restaurant.Mr Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built his career on lawsuits against the agency he would eventually lead, remained a favorite of Mr Trump’s for the majority of his tenure at the EPA. He began the largest regulatory rollback in the agency’s history, undoing, delaying or blocking several Obama-era environmental rules. Mr Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement on reducing emissions.In 2017, Mr Pruitt made headlines for questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own agency. Mr Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr Pruitt has done what he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant to let him go. Mr Pruitt has made himself available to the president as a confidante as well as a possible next attorney general.But ultimately the president grew disillusioned with Mr Pruitt after a cascade of accusations of impropriety and ethical missteps overshadowed Mr Pruitt’s policy achievements.In recent days, people who have spoken with Mr Trump said he sounds exasperated with his EPA administrator’s negative headlines. “It’s one thing after another with this guy,” one person close to Trump quoted the president as saying. Mr Pruitt is the subject of at least 13 federal investigations, and a government watchdog agency concluded he had broken the law with his purchase of a $43,000 secure telephone booth. He was also under investigation for his 2017 lease of a bedroom in a condominium linked to a Canadian energy company’s powerful Washington lobbying firm, and for accusations that he demoted or sidelined EPA employees who questioned his actions.Mr Pruitt had come under criticism for lavish expenditures on foreign travel, including a trip arranged for him by a lobbyist to Morocco, a country where the EPA has no policy agenda. His domestic travel also came under fire after a former staff member told congressional investigators that his boss often sought to travel to Oklahoma, where Mr Pruitt owns a home, directing his employees to “find me something to do” there so he could justify charging taxpayers for the expense.In recent months even conservative Republicans had taken the unusual step of criticising and questioning his ethics. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has started an investigation into Mr Pruitt’s actions at the EPA, the first such Republican-led inquiry into a Trump administration Cabinet member.On May 2nd, Mr Gowdy’s staff began conducting transcribed, behind-closed-doors interviews with Mr Pruitt’s closest aides. Partial transcripts from one of those interviews revealed that Pruitt used one of his top aides last year essentially as a personal assistant, having her help him search for an apartment as well as try to procure a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel. – NYTRead more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves around the world"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000157140466_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqckM73LBkofRqfnrUGvsfN8kokmBBfZYd8t7cNZkTT8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"novichok should do think exposed nerve agent","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary personnel with chemical weapons training have been deployed to Salisbury to aid the investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliadigitalservices@telegraphCounter-terror police say a couple left in a critical condition in Wiltshire were exposed to the same nerve agent as former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year.The couple, named locally as mother Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, were discovered in Amesbury, around eight miles from where the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok in March.The incident comes four months after Mr Skripal, 67, and and his 33-year-old daughter were poisoned in a suspected Russian backed assassination attempt and will lead to fears that the public in Salisbury could still be at risk.Mr Skripal, a former double agent, and his daughter, who had been visiting him from Moscow, spent two months in hospital. They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyDiver dies after running out of oxygen during Thai cave rescue Japan executes sarin gas attack cult leader and six members, according to reports Amesbury: Russia using UK as \u0026#39poison dumping ground\u0026#39, Home Secretary says, as couple fall victim to NovichokGermans send anti-bullying experts into schools to stop anti-SemitismDonald Trump hires Bill Shine, former Fox News executive, to head White House communicationsMike Pompeo to push Kim Jong-un for denuclearisation timeline on Pyongyang visitTate St Ives wins £100,000 Museum  of the Year prizeUse of rural rat runs soars as drivers take longer routes to avoid jamsAmber Rudd\u0026#39s daughter flies the nest -

Mr Pompeo, America\u0027s top diplomat, was due to arrive on Friday, for a personal meeting with Kim, as splits emerged in Donald Trump\u0027s administration over how quickly to demand disarmament.Mr Trump met the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, and later said that the threat of nuclear war was over.But US intelligence reports have since emerged suggesting ongoing activity at North Korean nuclear sites, and intelligence officials have expressed doubt that Kim has any intention of fully denuclearising in the near future.John Bolton, Mr Trump\u0027s national security adviser, who has taken a hard line on North Korea, said recently that Mr Pompeo would present Kim with a plan to dismantle his nuclear and missile programmes in just one year.But Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, later contradicted that. She said: In terms of a timeline, I know some iniduals have given timelines.  We’re not going to provide a timeline for that. A lot of work is left to be done, certainly. We go into this eyes wide open.As Mr Pompeo was in the air Ms Nauert denied that the administration had softened its stance.She said: We are committed to a denuclearised North Korea.Pressure was increasing on Mr Pompeo, who will stay the night in North Korea for the first time, to secure a concrete concession from Kim.Bill Richardson, the former US envoy to North Korea, said: I believe Kim Jong-un is trying to delay denuclearisation and do it at his own pace.If Mr Pompeo does not get the guarantees he wants from Kim it seems probable the US would increase its maximum pressure sanctions campaign that encouraged North Korea to negotiate in the first place.Mr Pompeo was arriving as peace efforts between North and South Korea continued.Two days of basketball games between teams from the two countries were taking place in Pyongyang on Thursday and Friday.The US secretary of state was due travel on from Pyongyang to Japanese and South Korea, in order to brief his counterparts there.Diver dies after running out of oxygen during Thai cave rescue Japan executes sarin gas attack cult leader and six members, according to reports Amesbury: Russia using UK as \u0026#39poison dumping ground\u0026#39, Home Secretary says, as couple fall victim to NovichokGermans send anti-bullying experts into schools to stop anti-SemitismDonald Trump hires Bill Shine, former Fox News executive, to head White House communicationsTate St Ives wins £100,000 Museum  of the Year prizeUse of rural rat runs soars as drivers take longer routes to avoid jamsAmber Rudd\u0026#39s daughter flies the nest -

The new extension to the gallery is deeply intelligent and breathtakingly beautiful, providing the perfect stage for a curatorial programme that is at once adventurous, inclusive and provocative.“The judges admired an architect and gallery team who devoted some 12 years to this transformational change, consulting with the local community all the way.”The judges were impressed by the support Tate St Ives has from the local communityMelanie Manchot, a member of the judging panel, said: “The extension has not so much been an addition as a complete re-imagining.”Tate St Ives was due to close for six months to accommodate the redevelopment, but problems with the building saw it extended to 18 months.Manchot said the fact that the museum kept its members during the closure “speaks to a sense of belonging and a new Tate St Ives so much more embedded in its community”.Diver dies after running out of oxygen during Thai cave rescue Japan executes sarin gas attack cult leader and six members, according to reports Amesbury: Russia using UK as \u0026#39poison dumping ground\u0026#39, Home Secretary says, as couple fall victim to NovichokGermans send anti-bullying experts into schools to stop anti-SemitismDonald Trump hires Bill Shine, former Fox News executive, to head White House communicationsMike Pompeo to push Kim Jong-un for denuclearisation timeline on Pyongyang visitUse of rural rat runs soars as drivers take longer routes to avoid jamsAmber Rudd\u0026#39s daughter flies the nest - to a £3m apartment with library and wine cellar Duty of Care: Mothers\u0026#39 excessive use of mobile phones is driving behavioural problems among children, study finds South African officials protest plan to auction a night in Nelson Mandela\u0026#39s prison cell for charity \u0026#39sleepover\u0026#39Only two thirds of Generation Z identify as \u0026#39exclusively heterosexual\u0026#39Goa farmers urged to improve crop yields by chanting ancient Hindu mantras instead of using fertiliserMay\u0026#39s Brexit deal revealed: Migration, customs, justice - and why it is leaving Eurosceptics incandescentIsle of Bute: Teenage boy known to Alesha MacPhail\u0026#39s family charged in connection with 6-year-old\u0026#39s deathScotland\u0026#39s warmest ever temperature \u0026#39invalid\u0026#39 as nearby car with engine running \u0026#39tampered with thermometer\u0026#39Married City worker who raped teenager so drunk she could \u0026#39barely stand up\u0026#39 is jailed for 8 yearsBritish diplomats called to Magaluf to probe number of tourists falling from hotel balconiesPolar bear kills Canadian man protecting his daughters in rare attack Drunk seagulls taken to RSPCA centres after \u0026#39drinking discarded alcohol on beach\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/04/18/gettyimages-984955250.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/04/18/gettyimages-984955250.jpg","title":"jaguar land rover brexit no deal leave uk job losses car manufacturer","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe Independent OnlineJaguar Land Rover says \u0027bad Brexit\u0027 would force it to stop investing in the UKCar giant Jaguar Land Rover has warned it urgently needs greater certainty on Brexit to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based jobs.The warning from the country\u0027s biggest carmaker follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus - and comes ahead of a crucial meeting of the Cabinet in Friday to finalise a White Paper on Brexit.Business Secretary Greg Clark said the Government is determined to ensure JLR, a great British success story, can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain.Dr Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR said the company\u0027s heart and soul was in the UK.He said: However we, and our partners in the supply chain, face an unpredictable future if the Brexit negotiations do not maintain free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2 billion profit each year.As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Tonight’s Love Island (5 July) saw four people kicked out of the villa\u0026nbspwhile Wes’s\u0026nbspplan to crack on\u0026nbspwith Megan came to fruition.\u0026nbspThere were two major storylines playing out throughout the evening. The first concerned Wes, who attempted multiple times to win over Megan) despite the former erotic dancer having a new beau, Alex (not to be confused with Doctor Alex, who she once was aligned with).\u0026nbspThen there was Georgia. Now completely over Josh, she through out the bait, hoping for a few nibbles in return.The two singletons eventually\u0026nbspfound themselves in a place of power, able to take two potential partners on a date each. Georgia chose Sam (partner with Ellie) and New Jack (seemingly happy\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspLaura), while Wes\u0026nbsppicked\u0026nbspDarylle\u0026nbspand, of course, Megan. The dates went swimmingly.Things finally got interesting when the producers announced the public vote. First, the three couples with the least votes – Ellie and Sam, Megan and Alex, Darylle and Adam – were singled out. Then, in a surprisingly brutal twist, the villa’s two singletons were asked to choose one person each to save. And while Wes\u0026nbsphad a golden opportunity to dump 2018’s hottest villain, the fool\u0026nbspdecided that a wonderful future with Megan awaited. Meanwhile, Georgia chose Sam, quite wisely.Love Island: best moments so farFrankie, Samira, Josh and Kazimir during the challenge265 Dani\u0027s drinks with EllieDani goes for drinks with Ellie outside of the villa, discussing Ellie\u0027s previous relationship with JackJack admits he loves Dani when he returns to the villa from Casa AmorMegan couples up with Alex and is shocked to see Wes return on his own, after he waited for her565 Georgia reacts to Josh returning with someone elseDani comforts Georgia after Josh chose to couple up with Kazimir665 Josh recouples with KazimirJosh returns to the villa with Kazimir765 Megan and DeanNew boy Dean also fancies Megan and takes his chance to kiss her865 Dani cries after seeing video of Jack reactingDani cries after she saw footage of Jack reacting to ex Ellie entering the villaBoth villa\u0027s competed against each other to win a party.

Please allow the live blog a minute to load.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Love Island live blog. Tonight\u0027s episode looks set to shake things up, a public vote seeing a\u0026nbspcouple evicted from the villa. But who? Here\u0027s to hoping Adam may finally be gone.\u0026nbspTonight\u0027s Love Island\u0026nbspshould provide some thrills: the public has voted a couple out, but who? Unfortunately, the chances are we will have to wait until Friday to find out. Here\u0027s hoping they don\u0027t end on a cliffhanger.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re slowly but surely approaching the start of tonight\u0027s episode. Without a World Cup game on, we\u0027re catching up on Wimbledon, which featured separate matches with Nadal and\u0026nbspDjokovic.Five minutes away- just five minutes. Get the kettle on.Keith Lemon there, introducing tonight\u0027s episode... And into the \u0027previously on\u0027... A recap of Wes trying to graft even harder than normal on MeganLater tonight. Drama with Wes, Laura, Georgia, and Megan to come. And someone\u0027s going home? But who? Will we even find out tonight?!I still don\u0027t think that\u0027s done, says new Alex. He knows something\u0027s going on. And so he\u0027s taken another new guy (who?) to talk about things. No advice though... just, venting... great help, mate.Wes brings the lads together - Adam, Josh, and Doctor Alex. At least we know who they all are! Meanwhile, Samira and Megan are chatting. Oh my God your heads gone, says Samira. Damn straight.I can\u0027t pick, says Megan. And now New Alex is approaching. Wes looks suspect. Their chat... what is this? Do they have more than a single brain cell between them? Subtlety out the window with this show.I\u0027m a completely honest girl, says Megan... Are we joking? This guy\u0027s a sucker. But he does get a smooch at the end. Can\u0027t imagine Wes is happy. Can we see Dani and Jack please? Bring some happiness back?And the first break. What did we accomplish? Ummm... not much. Megan\u0027s playing with these boys\u0027 hearts and they are lapping it up like puppy dogs. But let\u0027s be real here, Wes looks to have won Megan over. But, of course, who knows with her.

And just as indigenous people in the Americas were displaced by European colonists, the same is true of their dogs.”In their paper, published in the journal Science, the researchers compared genetic information from dozens of ancient North American and Siberian dogs ning a period of 9,000 years.Their analysis showed the dogs persisted for a long time but ultimately vanished, which to Dr Laurent Frantz from Queen Mary University of London said\u0026nbspsuggests “something catastrophic must have happened”.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.“It is fascinating that a population of dogs that inhabited many parts of the Americas for thousands of years, and that was an integral part of so many Native American cultures, could have disappeared so rapidly,” said Dr Frantz, who was also a senior author of the study.Today, few modern dogs possess any genetic traces of the ancient breeds.The researchers suggested the dogs’ near-total disappearance from the region was likely a result of both disease and cultural changes brought over by Europeans.It is possible, for example, that European colonists discouraged the sale and breeding of the dogs kept by indigenous Americans.“It is known how indigenous peoples of the Americas suffered from the genocidal practices of European colonists after contact,” said Kelsey Witt, who led part of the genome work as a graduate student at the University of Illinois.\u0026nbsp“What we found is that the dogs of indigenous peoples experienced an even more devastating history and a near-total loss, possibly as a result of forced cultural changes and disease.”Bizarrely, one of the only traces of genetic information from “pre-contact” dogs can be found in a transmissible tumour that spreads between dogs known as CTVT.\u0026nbspIt’s quite incredible to think that possibly the only survivor of a lost dog lineage is a tumour that can spread between dogs as an infection,” added Maire Ní Leathlobhair, co-first author, from the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbsp“Although this cancer’s DNA has mutated over the years, it is still essentially the DNA of that original founder dog from many thousands of years ago.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As well as being a huge drain on water supplies they can add to water bills and take hours to fill,” said Trewin Restorick, CEO of Hubbub.Polling conducted by the group found that a third of households in the UK own a paddling pool, and 27 per cent intend to fill it up over the weekend, as temperatures across the country once again exceed 30C.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonThough Hubbub urged people to be conservative with their pool use, they offered some tactics that will prevent excessive water waste.Among their suggestions were sharing pools among friends and families, using water sterilising tablets instead of refilling every day\u0026nbspand reusing the water to keep the garden hydrated or to wash the car.They also recommended taking quicker showers or avoiding washing the car if people have a weekend of paddling pool fun ahead of them.“No one wants to be a killjoy – it’s really hot and we’re all looking for ways to keep cool and have fun in the sun,” said Mr Restorick.The warning comes as throughout the UK the sustained period of high temperatures plays havoc with the nation’s agriculture and wildlife.Hot weather has sparked concerns among British farmers, who are worried about crops ripening too early and the knock-on effects on milk production and winter food supplies for animals.Britain’s animals are also under pressure, especially those that rely on damp habitats, and wildlife groups have called on the public to\u0026nbsphelp by providing water sources and maintaining damp habitats.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

That, businesses say, could be economically disastrous.                May\u0027s Brexit plan to align UK with EU could JEOPARDISE US trade deal                Tory Brexiteer presents \u0027simple choice\u0027 Theresa May must make on tradeThe Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from EU officials, companies and some lawmakers to move faster with the negotiations to leave the EU, a departure that will be Britain\u0027s biggest trading and foreign policy shift in half a century.The new plan would see Britain closely mirror EU rules, use technology to determine where goods will end up and therefore which tariffs should be applied, and hand Britain the freedom to set its own tariffs on incoming goods.Aides suggest it offers the best of both worlds. A spokeswoman for Mrs May dismissed concerns the proposal would prevent Britain from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU.She said: It is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US.Friday\u0027s meeting will not be plain sailing. Mrs May\u0027s Brexit minister, David Davis, has sent her a letter describing the plan as unworkable, a source close to him said.Those wanting a clean break from the EU fear being kept in the EU\u0027s customs sphere, seeing it as a betrayal of Brexit that would curtail Britain\u0027s freedom to negotiate deals with non-EU countries.Tory MP Owen Paterson said: We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.Business minister Greg Clark said he was confident ministers would reach an agreement on future customs plans, with the government focused on supporting jobs.Even if she finds agreement at home, Mrs May still faces the hard task of winning the support of the EU, which poured cold water on her previous suggestions for customs arrangements.Today Mrs May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and restated her wish to negotiate a deep trade and security partnership after Brexit, her spokesman said.Mrs Merkel again stressed it was the European Commission leading the Brexit negotiations, rather than member states. That may have dampened Mrs May\u0027s hope of winning support from Germany before the Chequers meeting.David Davis meets EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels ahead of a crunch meeting of European Union leaders later this week                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10British Brexit minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in BrusselsWith the clock ticking towards a March departure date and passions running high, Mrs May needs to thrash out an agreement with Brussels urgently.Mrs May was forced to ditch her preferred option for a customs partnership, which would have seen Britain collecting tariffs on goods entering the country on the EU\u0027s behalf, under pressure from Brexit campaigners in her government.They had backed a streamlined customs arrangement now known as max fac, which would see trusted traders allowed to cross borders freely with the aid of automated technology.The facilitated customs arrangement is described by her aides as a way to use the best bits of both options.Mrs May\u0027s plan suggests there will be a type of customs union for physical goods, something that should please manufacturers. But based on the detail offered so far, there is little on how Britain\u0027s much larger services sector would trade with the EU.Several ministers suggested they would read over the plan later on Thursday, ready for a meeting which is expected to run late into the evening. Health minister Jeremy Hunt called for the cabinet to get behind our prime minister.Hours before ministers began the journey to Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60km) northwest of London, businesses issued warnings of what impact their decisions could have.Britain\u0027s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said a chaotic Brexit would cost it \u0026pound1.2 billion ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing operations in the United Kingdom, while the retail industry said a no deal might see food rotting at ports.Britain\u0027s biggest union Unite attacked government failure to make progress in negotiations so far.General secretary Len McCluskey said in a statement: \u0026ldquoDrop your red lines and secure a decent deal, one that is to the benefit of the working people of this country."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/mogg-984585.jpg","title":"brexit news jacob rees mogg theresa may eu leaked report chequers latest","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg is calling for Theresa May to rip up the common rulebookSenior ministers yesterday received discussion papers ahead of today\u0027s crunch Cabinet summit at Chequers which included details of a common rulebook covering farm produce and other goods expected to cover both the EU and UK following the country\u0027s departure from the bloc.The document also suggested the planned regulatory alignment would not allow the UK to accommodate expected US demands for a future trade deal.Downing Street officials insisted it was categorically untrue that the plan would make a US trade deal impossible.But senior Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg led calls for Mrs May to rip up the proposal.\u0026ldquoIf this is correct this is not Brexit. This common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state, said the MP, who is chairman of the powerful 60-strong European Research Group of Tory backbenchers.                \u0027I was WRONG\u0027 Carney admits Bank of England Brexit prediction MISTAKE                Nervous Prime Minister reveals speaking notes to waiting camerasHe advised the Prime Minister to follow the example set by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was reported to have torn up an earlier Government documents setting out post-Brexit customs proposals.The Prime Minister should imitate Mr Gove and tear up this paper, Mr Rees-Mogg said.Brexit-backing Cabinet ministers including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and EU Exit Secretary were understood to be deeply uncomfortable with the proposals. One Brexiteer source said backbench Eurosceptics did not expect the PM\u0027s plans to even reach MPs because Boris and David aren\u0027t having it.Another ministerial source said: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos see what the Prime Minister had to say, but it does sound very concerning.The document handed to ministers yesterday said: The UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food.It also said the UK will make an upfront choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods.Michael Gove was reported to have torn up earlier post-Brexit proposalsFar less regulatory alignment between Britain and the EU was expected for the service sector, the document said.We would strike a different arrangement for services, where it is our interests to have regulatory flexibility, recognising this will result in reduced market access, it added.The document went on to admit that the alignment of regulations between Britain and the EU would \u0026ldquonot allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal regarding a mutual recognition of standards.Tory Eurosceptics were particularly incensed that the potential threat to a US trade deal had been revealed just a week before the Prime Minister is due to hold talks about a future UK-US trade deal with Donald Trump on his first presidential visit to Britain.Former Tory Cabinet minister Owen Paterson said: If true, this would be a complete breach of Theresa May\u0027s manifesto commitment, reconfirmed to me at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions yesterday, to leave single market, customs union and EU Court of Justice.We could not eliminate tariffs to reduce prices for consumers and businesses, or strike free trade deals.Again if true, this would deny 100 per cent of British economy the full benefits of Brexit to appease only 12 per cent of UK GDP accounted for by exports to EU and be completely at odds with what 17.4 million voted for.We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.Lucy Allan, another Tory MP, said: This is not Brexit.Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u0026ldquoThe paper proposes that the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods, including agri-food and that the UK should make \u0026lsquoan upfront choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoThis is entirely unacceptable. To all intents and purposes, it would lock the UK into the customs union and Single Market in perpetuity.\u0026ldquoFurthermore, the paper acknowledges that the proposal, if adopted, would preclude a free trade agreement with the United States, the world\u0026rsquos biggest market.\u0026ldquoTo proceed along such a path would be wholly contrary to the national interest, and I hope and expect the cabinet to reject it.The Conservative MP is known for his upper-class mannerisms and traditionalist views                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10\u0026ldquoQuite simply, this is not what people voted for in 2016.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved.

Heres what we know about the action.Pilots who are members of its Irish trade union will go on strike for the first time on Thursday, July 12, in a row over working practices.Unions representing cabin crews in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will strike for two days between July 25 and 26, whilst the Italian crews will strike for one day on July 25.Europes biggest budget carrier averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by deciding to recognise trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries.Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130million passengers last year, has so far signed agreements with pilots in Italy and Britain, two of its largest markets, but also experienced minor disruption in Germany and Portugal.Ryanair pilots eligible to vote in a ballot called by the Forsa/IALPA trade union, which does not include contractors, backed the call to engage in industrial action and will strike for 24 hours.The union, which said 94 of the 95 ballots returned were in favour of industrial action, has advised Ryanair that it will notify it of additional strike days in due course but also remains available and willing to engage on the issues.Some 120 union members, most of them captains, are directly employed by Ryanair and able to strike, a spokesman for the union said.Around 400 of Ryanairs more than 4,000 pilots are based in Ireland.It is too early to say which flights will be affected by the pilot walkout.At the moment only pilots based in Ireland are striking.However it is one of the busiest times for parents as schools in Northern Ireland are already on their summer break.Ryanair said it would contact customers travelling from Ireland if the strike went ahead and invited the union to its offices for talks.It said Forsa/IALPA had failed to take up 18 previous invitations to do so.Since Ireland accounts for less than 7 per cent of Ryanair flights, we expect that 93 per cent of our customers will be unaffected by any strike, it said in a statement.While Ryanair has also had success in Britain and Italy signing recognition agreements with cabin crew, some of its crew will gather in Dublin on Wednesday to demand better conditions in their first pan-European summit.Shares in the airline are down 21 per cent from an all-time high last August before it had to cancel 20,000 flights over a rota fiasco, triggering the pilot unrest."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004181254991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"rebecca boyle broke neck superyacht england world cup win colombia","story":"South African Jonty Brits said Rebecca, 32, was left unsteady on her feet when she returned to her cabin - where cops say she fell and broke her neck.Cops in Imperia, Italy, say Rebecca died after falling down the steps after a night celebrating Englands World Cup victory against Colombia.She had only started work as chief stewardess on board the £6million 47-metre La Polonia last week and was working on it while it was docked in Imperia, on the Italian Riveria.Jonty told The Sun Online: I can tell you precisely what happened because I was the only one sober. And the police have told me that my story is fully backed up by video pictures they have.I first saw her at around 7pm sitting on a bench opposite my boat which was alongside hers. She was with a tall crew-mate. They were both drinking vodka straight out of the bottle and talking quite loudly.I left them there to go and watch Englands World Cup match at Le Grotte, a bar near the quayside. It is the one all the crews favour. I did not see Rebecca there, though it was quite crowded.I invited her and her colleague to join me and a member of my crew to the Jacuzzi on our sundeck. She said something about a great result for England, but wasnt making a lot of sense otherwise.She was still drinking vodka but could only manage three sips or so. I had to help her down from the sundeck when she left around midnight.Her colleague stayed behind. I got her off the boat OK, and helped her onto her own gangway. I could not go on with her because it was private.Rebecca was very unsteady on her feet. The last I saw of her was when she entered the doors to the ship. It is very sad.Earlier reports that she had left the boat to visit the local bar were incorrect, according to a crew member who said she watched the game aboard the Polonia.The Maltese-registered vessel had arrived at the Italian port last week and was undergoing a changeover ahead of a new arrival.Crew members raised the alarm yesterday morning when she failed to turn up for breakfast and found her lifeless in her cabin.Colonel Pier Enrico Burri, of the Imperia Carabinieri, today told The Sun Online: The cause of death is still unknown but it seems as though she may have stumbled or slipped inside her cabin and hit her head or neck hard, breaking her vertebrae.She seems to have died between 12pm and 1am and her body was found about 8am. An Italian member of crew rang to alert us.The body was on the floor. The cabin was single, she slept there alone and very small as they are on boats. Her suitcases were on the floor as though she were rearranging things.She may have hit her head on the door of the cabin or while getting her suitcase down. These cabins are very constrained.He added: There was no blood and no traces of violence or other people. It seems as if no one else was on board when she died.The autopsy has to be done still but it looks like an accident.And Matteo Andracco, the lawyer representing the boats owners, said the boats chief engineer heard her alarm go off about 6.30am.After a few minutes when she didnt turn it off he went in and saw she was not moving, so they called an ambulance. In her room there were two levels, a lower level with the bed and an upper level with a small bathroom.It seems likely she fell down the five or six steps between the levels. So far nobody is under investigation. Police believe it was just an unlucky accident.Neighbours of Rebeccas, in Londons trendy Notting Hill, today paid tribute to her, saying she was a genuinely nice person who always said hello.One, called Chris, said: She never caused any trouble here. She kept herself to herself, but always said hello to me and my kids.He added: Its genuinely shocking to hear, she was so young. Its always the nice ones it happens to. I hope for the family gets this sorted out soon."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004180758431.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather heatwave longest hotspell britain 42 years","story":"Today is our 11th day of high temperatures hovering around 28C, although showers will briefly roll in across the South today.And we are on course to beat the summer of 1976 when 16 consecutive days of scorching hot weather led to the worst drought in 150 years.Meteorologist Emma Slater told The Times: The long-range trend is for above average temperatures staying until the end of July.Temperature records are being broken worldwide during the current heatwave sweeping from North America across Europe and Asia.A world record highest sustained temperature was recorded in Quriyat, Oman, at the end of June — where locals had to cope with a minimum of 42.6C over 24hrs.Meanwhile, 47C was recorded in Ottowa, Canada this week, while residents in Ahvaz, Iran hit a record 54C.In the UK, record temperatures were recorded in Belfast (29.5C) and Glasgow (31.9C) — where the weatherproof roof of the citys Science Centre melted in the heat.Heavy rain and showers today will only briefly intrude on the summer scorcher.Up to 20mm is expected to fall in the south east — but the stormy weather is set to clear for Super Saturday as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter finals.It will also be the first weekend of Wimbledon and the London Pride march — with pub industry insiders predicting an extra eight million pints will be sold as Brits flock to beer gardens.A hosepipe ban was activated in Northern Ireland on June 29 and restrictions in England, Wales and Scotland are expected to follow.Anyone caught using a hosepipe could end up in court and be given a £1,000 fine.However, it seems homeowners are ignoring the pleas from water firms as sales of sprinklers at Wickes have rocketed by 600 per cent, the Daily Star reports.Sales of the Hozelock part which attaches to garden hoses have also gone up by 135 per cent.A Wickes spokesman said: “To see demand for sprinklers increase so significantly in the last four weeks suggests customers are opting to use a sprinkler while simultaneously enjoying all that summer has to offer.”Overall temperatures will be around 82F (28C) for the 11th consecutive day today.This is expected to trigger some torrential downpours and thunderstorms — a jarring end to several days of a 30C-plus heatwave.Parts of the south west including Dorset have already had a washout — and more southeasterly areas will see the rainfall today.But the showers will clear quickly as the we approach the weekend when sunny skies and high temperatures will take hold once again.Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: “These downpours are actually part of the heatwave.“All signs suggest that it is going to carry on until the end of the month and possibly beyond.”Some patchy cloud will be the only spoiler on an otherwise sunny 30C day on Friday in the south — with an even warmer picture in store for a day of sport on Saturday.The highest temperature is expected to be recorded in the London area on Saturday with 31C or 32C forecast.Elsewhere it will stay largely dry and warm on Friday and Saturday across the UK.Light drizzle is expected to affect northwestern parts at times over the weekend but it will mainly be a sunny picture across the country.Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell told The Sun Online: Today many places will still be warm and sunny, but with a slightly fresher feel in the north west.There is a risk of rain with some heavy and thundery showers in southern England this afternoon and into the evening, while it remains largely dry elsewhere.Into the weekend, an area of high pressure will move in bringing dry weather with sunshine for most places.There could be some cloudy patches in northern and northwestern areas but otherwise it will be a clear.On Saturday the highest temperature could be 31C or higher in the London area."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418332041.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"melting road australia hot weather glues vehicle road","story":"Tar

Courier Mail: As soon as the sun came out, it started sticking... a lot of soft tar sprayed in big globs and sticking to truck wheels.The road has been unsafe since a resurfacing job last week was ruined by wet weather, causing the bitumen to become loose and cracked.Mrs Stacey: “It’s especially bad for holidaymakers who come up for the holidays and are stuck up here with tar dripping up the tyres.”Others told of their motoring misery, as temperatures hit the high 80s.A Department of Transport spokeswoman said the department was now working to fix the problem.She said: “We are aware of issues with the recent reseal works.“The section of road was temporarily closed to all traffic but has reopened two lanes with reduced speeds following emergency repairs.”Last week, the DoT put a temporary reduced speed limit of 40mph on the stretch to prevent loose gravel from damaging driver’s windshields.About 60 motorists have reportedly contacted the department seeking compensation for damage caused to their cars."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418359725.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk heatwave river teme photos dries

Gagas stylist, Brandon Maxwell.She had her hair in a bun for the event which was hosted by Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland.Prior the event, royal fans had been speculating that the pair had stopped holding hands in public after Harry appeared to rebuff her attempts last week.Before their wedding in Windsor, Berks, the couple were always openly affectionate in public, possibly more so than other royal couple.But last week Meghan moved her hand in her husband’s direction at the Young Leaders Reception at Buckingham Palace - but he quickly clasped his hands away from her.It soon emerged that Harry, 33, was following traditional etiquette.Body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the MailOnline: “The Queen rarely holds hands with her husband in public and this seems to have set an unwritten precedent for the other royals.”Harrys brother Prince William typically avoids holding hands with the Duchess of Cambridge during official visits.But it seems they are not following traditional etiquette as they were seen holding hands at the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception on Thursday afternoon.It marks the culmination of the Commonwealth Secretariats youth leadership workshop.The workshop brings together the newly-elected Commonwealth Youth Council Executive and leaders of the Commonwealth youth networks.It aims to encourage them to think about

calories a day on holiday","story":"Healthy eating goes out the window for most when they are away from their own kitchen, and fridge, a survey found.Almost two thirds admitted to gaining weight on a trip away from home.And another one in three who are regularly on-the-go confessed to increasing their calorie intake to 3,000 calories or more a day.Three quarters confessed to overeating and dinner time is the meal they are most likely to overindulge at, with the research also finding women are more likely to gorge themselves than men.The study of 2,000 adults also found eating on-the-go and a lack of home-cooked meals are the main causes for over indulging while on holiday or business.Furthermore it emerged more than half wished they could eat more domestic comfort meals while staying at hotels.Raul Ortiz, VP of global brand marketing for Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites at IHG, which carried out the study, said: “Our research clearly shows Brits miss home-cooked, fresh meal choices while travelling.Our guests are often away from home for days or weeks at a time and we want to give them the option to cook for themselves as if they were in the comfort of their own home.British Chef and television food presenter, Matt Tebbutt, has teamed up with Staybridge Suites® to create ‘Tastes of Home’ - easy, home-cooked recipes which guests can cook while staying at the hotel.Matt Tebbutt said: “As someone who is constantly on the road, I know how easy it is to overindulge when you’re eating out every day and night.“That’s why I’m thrilled to partner with Staybridge Suites to bring their guests quick, easy and tasty recipes that they can enjoy from the comfort of their suite.“I’ve created variations on some of the nation’s favourites, including a healthier Fish and Chips, a unique twist on a traditional Spaghetti Bolognese, and a mouth-watering Ditalini pasta dish with poached chicken and a tarragon dressing. I can’t wait for guests to give them a try.”The study also found the fear of not having home comforts leads to some travellers bringing their own food items along on the trip.Being a nation of tea lovers, a quarter keep their own stash of teabags in their luggage to ensure their brews are exactly how they like them.One in nine ensure they have packets of crisps on hand and one in 10 keep cereals tucked away.Roast dinner with Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips and spaghetti bolognaise were revealed as the top three dishes missed most when living away from home.Over half have felt guilty about their eating habits away from home, with one in 10 feeling so guilt-ridden they will even lie to their partner about their diet.And four in 10 said eating out with others impacts their ability to make healthy choices.Ortiz added: “While staying at Staybridge Suites, guests have access to a spacious, fully equipped kitchen with all the utensils they need, and thanks to Matt’s recipes, they can now enjoy a new take on a ‘Taste of Home’ even when they’re on the road.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The number of miles clocked up by vans on the roads – 50.5billion - is up almost 70 per cent on 1997.Car use also rose to a new record level despite sky-high petrol prices given the chaos on the railways and councils cutting bus services.A 30 per cent rise would take total miles in 2040 to 425.1billion.Motoring campaigners urged the Government to invest in the road network – or see Brits locked in ever longer traffic jams.Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, stormed: “The huge rise in van traffic shows a change in consumer habits with the steady rise of online shopping – as well as more people turning to self-employment.“But car use also shows no sign of slowing down any time soon, so more investment is needed to tackle the problem.“Potholes on the roads are a national disgrace and a key contributor to congestion levels. The Government most get a grip.”Howard Cox, co-founder of FairFuel UK said: “A growing population, internet delivery and poor public transport means more people are driving.“Time to scrap HS2 and put the vanity cash where it’s needed - into roads and public transport to benefit the whole of the UK.”The 327billion miles clocked up on Britain’s roads included record levels on the motorways – nearly 70 billion miles.

Tea party is likely to give way to pyjama party as warring Tory ministers drag talks at Chequers late into the night. But it\u0027ll be anything but a happy occasion. Tories are already at war in public The issues are tricky to grasp - but the result will be felt in the pockets of millions of hard-working mums, dads, students and workers. So here\u0027s a quick explanation of what\u0027s going to happen.  Chequers is the stuffy 16th Century stately home in Buckinghamshire that is the retreat of the Prime Minister of the day. It was used as a rural bolthole by wartime leader Winston Churchill, who made morale-boosting broadcasts to the nation from its rooms. Prime Ministers down the years have hosted foreign leaders in its luxury.  Margaret Thatcher entertained American president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while Tony Blair welcomed US president Bill Clinton.  When is the Chequers summit?  The Cabinet is being summoned to Chequers from 9.30am on Friday 6 July. Ministers have reportedly been told to surrender their phones to prevent leaks. They have also reportedly been warned the meeting could drag on for more than 12 hours until 10pm. Who\u0027s going?  The entire Cabinet of more than 20 ministers is expected to be at the summit. This is more than Theresa May\u0027s 11-strong inner circle, the Brexit \u0027war Cabinet\u0027, that met at Chequers last time. Importantly, the full Cabinet is thought to have more of a \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 majority than the inner circle. This could change the result. What\u0027s this all about?  There\u0027s lots of detail (see below!) but it all comes down to this.  Do we want Hard Brexit or Soft Brexit?  Tories are painfully, irreversibly split on whether to cut ties with the EU or hold them close. With big decisions needed by October, Theresa May is going to have to come off the fence and - at least a bit - choose one side or the other. What is actually getting discussed?  Ministers are being asked to sign off a \u0027White Paper\u0027 on Brexit. White Papers are a document, traditionally printed on (you guessed it) white paper, that represent the view of the government. The White Paper will set out more detail of what kind of relationship Britain wants with the EU after we leave properly on 31 December 2020. Once it\u0027s signed off, Theresa May is planning a tour of European capitals to sell the idea to leaders before EU bureaucrats begin their summer holiday. Why is customs so important?  The EU has a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU are taxed at 10%. Being in this customs union helps the UK, because the EU is our biggest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. Theresa May wants the UK to leave it because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. But not only has this created a headache of how to keep the border open between Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic (EU). It\u0027s also opened up a huge row with Brussels, because it\u0027ll have to solve the key riddle about Brexit - hard, or soft. So the Prime Minister has been drawing up a ready-made plan for future customs which will be at the heart of the White Paper. What are our options?      At first, Britain was looking at two options.   Customs partnership: Liked by Remainers, branded idiotic by Brexiteers.  Britain would stick close to EU tariffs on imports and collect them on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, firms would be able to reclaim the difference.   Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: Liked by Brexiteers, but could cost firms \u0026pound20bn a year.  Would keep the UK separate from Brussels rules. High-tech tracking devices would try to cut bureaucracy. E.g. Trusted” firms could pay tariffs at regular intervals, not every time they cross a border.   Now ministers are set to consider this \u0027third way\u0027:   Facilitated Customs Arrangement: A compromise. The UK would leave blanket EU tariffs, allowing us to set our own import duties. But if goods are unfinished or destined to end up in the EU, Britain would still collect EU tariffs on Brussels\u0027 behalf. And crucially, the UK would keep many of the same rules - regulatory alignment - as the EU on standards of goods.  Who\u0027s not happy about it?  David Davis, for a start. In an 11th-hour letter to Theresa May, the Brexit Secretary reportedly warned the EU will simply reject the plan. And Brexiteer Tories are furious - after fears emerged the \u0027FAC\u0027 will make it much harder to secure a US trade deal. Under the plan, Britain would closely mirror EU standards on goods. The problem is, the US uses very different rules so would be disadvantaged. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the : “If this is correect this is not Brexit. The common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state.  Late, and quite possibly dramatically. If ministers still refuse to sign up to the plan, it\u0027s possible they could resign. If that happens, expect late-night TV statements in the Buckinghamshire countryside or interviews squished around Saturday\u0027s World Cup clash. However, it might be that they all reach agreement - and keep schtum about what they\u0027re not happy with. After all, David Davis has repeatedly threatened to resign, and by now it seems as if he\u0027s crying wolf. What happens next?

But the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman flatly denied claims it would be “impossible.” It comes after papers circulated to her cabinet ahead of tomorrow’s crunch summit at Chequers threatened to spark a revolt among Brexiteers. The new plan will see Britain closely mirror EU rules, use technology to determine where goods will end up and therefore which tariffs should be applied, and hand Britain the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the : “If this is correect this is not Brexit. The common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state. “The Prime Minister should imitate Mr Gove and tear up this paper.”  The Prime Minister’s spokeswoman said: “It is categorically untrue to suggest we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.” Asked if it would be harder to get a deal, she declined to comment further. Senior ministers gather at Chequers from 9.30am as they bid to finally thrash out an EU withdrawal plan, more than two years after the referendum. They will be forced to hand over their phones at the door. Dinner is planned but ministers are not expected to sleep over. Downing Street sources expect the talks to be tense but do not anticipate resignations.  The October deadline for a deal with Brussels means just six weeks of talks with the EU are left. The UK is due to leave the bloc on March 29. Manufacturers urged negotiators to speed-up plans following fears firms are withholding investment and food could rot at ports without a pact. The PM faces two more flash points this month when Tory rebels will reignite demands for Britain to stay in a customs union. MPs will debate the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill on July 16 and the Trade Bill the next day. No 10 claims the customs blueprint to be unveiled today(FRI) offers “the best of both worlds” after two previous proposals were ditched. The latest idea would allow the UK to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine the goods’ final destination and whether UK or EU tariffs are due. But Brexit Secretary Mr Davis told the PM the “facilitated customs arrangement” will be rejected. It came as Jaguar Land Rover warned a “bad” Brexit deal could cost the car-maker \u0026pound1.2billion every year. Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth said: “We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.” German firms are shelving British projects while uncertainty reigns, according to German Industry UK. Urging the Government to “settle” with the EU, it said “we still don’t know what a post-Brexit Britain will look like, two years after the referendum”.

The Cabinet must fall in behind her at their Chequers Summit on Friday, giving her an unambiguous mandate to negotiate and agree the best, most realistic, Brexit deal she can with Brussels. And I say this as Chairman of Best for Britain, a leading campaign group calling for an end to Brexit, that has sought to challenge and oppose the Government at every turn. Why? Because our country is a victim of prolonged uncertainty. In recent weeks we have heard how investment in our automotive industry has halved how 14,000 jobs at Airbus could be lost and how we are going to have to fund a growing NHS budget despite shrinking public finances. Investment, workers, skilled and unskilled, are melting away as uncertainty stretches into years if not decades.  At the moment the Prime Minister and her warring team are hiding behind their own disputes over the terms of Brexit to avoid engaging in the real negotiation with Brussels. The reckless personal ambition driving these factions is surely close to treason. Its time to bring these Oxford Union debating games to an end. The British people deserve to be finally told what the vote to Leave will mean in real terms: How will we live up to our historic commitments to both sides in Northern Ireland to allow open and unrestricted trade Which sectors will or won’t enjoy frictionless trade and for how long how will we safeguard our public services in trade deal negotiations what are the government’s concrete proposals to protect our access to clinical trials and to vital medicines and treatments, on which people’s lives depend What is the their plan to maintain cross-border supply chains in our important manufacturing sectors such as the car industry or pharmaceuticals what is the deal for services that comprise a much bigger share of our economy but seem overlooked in the discussions how do we solve the complex issue of freedom of movement "},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows married city worker","story":"NewsCCTV shows married City worker, 28, dragging teen victim down alley to rape herWARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Sanjay Naker led the young woman from a bar in London Bridge before assaulting and raping her in a sickening 30-minute attack\u0026nbspShareByLucy Clarke-BillingsGrainne Cuffe16:57, 5 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHorrific CCTV captured the moment a sexual predator dragged an intoxicated teenager to a secluded area to rape her. Top financial consultant Sanjay Naker preyed on his victim after she was asked to leave a bar in London Bridge for being too drunk. The married 28-year-old had been outside the bar at about 4am and started talking to the 18-year-old. On the CCTV, Naker appeared to show concern for her welfare by picking her up when she fell and offering her his jacket. At one point, he gave her a piggback. But then the PricewaterhouseCoopers worker tried to kiss the victim before she pushed him away.  CCTV shows him pulling her in the opposite direction to where she was walking and eventually succeeded, dragging her to a secluded corner on The Queens Walk. He then raped her and sexually assaulted her.  Security staff working nearby went to investigate after seeing the suspicious behaviour on CCTV. They found the teenager unconscious on the ground with her underwear pulled down and called the ambulance. Naker said he had met the victim in a club nearby, gave them his details and left the scene.  The victim was taken to hospital to recover, and later to Haven rape crisis centre where the sexual offences were confirmed. Sanjay Naker, of Wood Green, London, was jailed for eight years today after being found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of three counts of oral rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of sexual assault. Investigating officer, detective constable Aidan Kersley, from the Met’s Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command, said: “Naker deliberately targeted his victim as someone intoxicated and vulnerable. “After talking to her for a matter of minutes, he managed to drag her to a secluded area where he raped her. She has no memory of what happened.

The fast-food outlet in Digby, Exeter, has been accused of having a \u0027shocking\u0027 rat and maggot by a former employee. The pictures show inside the restaurant including a rubbish-strewn area, greasy appliances and burnt rice. But KFC has defended the branch saying significant changes have been made - and that it now has a five-star hygiene rating. Greg Cook, 31, who used to work at the restaurant, told Devon Live : “There’s a big maggot and rat problem at that store. “When I used to turn up at 6am for my shift, you would always see them running back to their little dens.  It was a regular issue and customers had even pointed it out to the management. “But if you look at the state of the place and how rubbish is left out all the time, then you can understand why. “The defrosting cabinets are supposed to be cleaned two times a day, but this doesn’t happen, and it got so bad that the place got filled with maggots.” Mr Cook says the stress of working at the KFC outlet took its toll, and he eventually left two months ago in order to move closer to his pregnant girlfriend in Dawlish. He says the stress got so bad a few years ago that he was signed off for a month and was given medication.  And he revealed he was even spat at by one disgruntled customer, who had been told that the restaurant was running low on popcorn chicken . He said: “My hair was falling out, it got that bad. “Things got really bad during the chicken shortage earlier this year as well. “I was even spat at when I told a customer that we were short on popcorn chicken. It was horrible. “All in all, though, the whole place is a joke. The standards are poor and its time people knew what they were putting in their mouths.”  Another previous employee, who can’t be named, backed up Mr Cook\u0027s claims. She told DevonLive: “I once worked there and a guy came out the toilet and didn\u0027t wash his hands and I didn\u0027t say anything. “I saw him scratch his front bits and then batter chicken. “It\u0027s not nice having to serve food when you know what happens behind the scenes.” A KFC spokesperson told Devon Live that changes have recently been made to the management at the store.

Little Hall\u0026eacute Rodgers, who turns three later this month, loves to causs mischief scrawling black eyeliner over the furniture and ordering her parents about. Decorating the sofa and walls in nappy cream and nibbling on blocks of cheese, her parents believe she is one of the most mischievous toddlers in the country. She has mum Chantelle Rodgers, 26, and dad Clive, 27, wrapped around her little finger in their home in Falmouth, Cornwall.  Chantelle, who is a receptionist and has two other young kids with Clive, said: Anyone who knows us will tell you she is the boss of the family, especially when it comes to her dad. She rules him. The temper on her is crazy but my god is it hilarious. She is a proper diva. I call her my sassy, side-eye little miss. She is obsessed with dairy. She goes through 18-24 yoghurts every few days. And if she doesn’t get those yogurts she sulks. Every day I go into the fridge and find Hall\u0026eacute-sized bite marks in our block of cheese. I’ve tried wrapping it in tin foil and hiding it as soon as I buy it but she always finds it. I even tried grating it all and hiding it in a bowl but the next time I went into the kitchen there were just little bits of cheese over the floor and an empty bowl in the fridge. When you confront her she says ‘no, not Hall\u0026eacute’.  Chantelle and Clive say they are always repairing damage the cheeky youngster has caused around the home. One night she managed to make it all the way downstairs and smother the sofa in Sudocrem without making a sound. I still haven’t got all the marks out. On another occasion she got hold of my eyeliner and when Clive and I came upstairs the carpets, the walls, the bedding, everything was covered. When she’s not causing utter chaos, she is trying to give me a heart attack. She can be a bit of a nightmare and with three under five I definitely have my hands full, the mum-to-three added. But the parents admit Hall\u0026eacute is the life and soul of their young family and can brighten the darkest of days in minutes.  Chantelle continued: She is pure entertainment and she makes us all laugh so much, especially her little sister. You can be having the worst day and spending two minutes with Hall\u0026eacute will brighten it. And as well as her mischievous side, Hall\u0026eacute is quite the mother hen. She’s always bossing us about. If someone is walking around upstairs and they’re stomping a bit Hall\u0026eacute will shout up ‘stop banging’ and if they don’t she’ll shout again ‘I told you to stop banging’. She is a funny little thing. She loves getting everyone dressed in the morning and if she comes into the living room and her dad and I have left a couple of cups lying around she’ll go ‘ooh it’s messy in here’. Then she comes in and offers to do the washing up. She’s also always trying to clean up after herself when she makes a mess, bless her.

Yvonne Radcliff, 74, had to turn around and go home after heading for a day out to Birmingham\u0027s new \u0026pound7 million Legoland Discovery Centre. She had set off from her home in Hall Green in the city to the new attraction which opened on Thursday. But the Lego-loving pensioner had her plans for a day out shattered when a staff member told her that no adults could enter without a child.  Yvonne told Birmingham Live: “I couldn’t believe it.  Adults make Lego, it’s wonderful. Yet I wasn’t allowed in because I didn’t have a kid with me. You couldn’t make it up really.  “I think Lego is fascinating. I’ve watched documentaries on TV and saw it was opening in town. “I told my daughter I fancied a day out to see it, so I got on the train to Snow Hill and walked the rest of the way there. “Once I got there, I walked in and a girl stopped me and said I wasn’t allowed in. She said it’s the rules - I must be accompanied by a child. She added: “I was shocked and appalled to tell you the truth. It’s nonsense really. “A family was in front of me so I said can I walk in with them as they had children, she just said ‘No, you’re a stranger’.  “You’d thought they’d take pity on a pensioner - and the kids aren’t off school yet. “I just had to walk away and go back home.”  The Legoland Discovery Centre website states that “adults must be accompanied by children to enter Legoland Discovery Centre”.  The new venue is, however, staging an adult-only evening for Lego fans on July 11 between 5pm and 7pm. In a detailed statement, a spokesman for Legoland said: “LEGOLAND Discovery Centre’s are not theme parks but small, indoor attractions specifically conceived and designed from a child’s perspective to provide safe and fun environments for families with children aged 3-10 to enjoy together.

Sometimes it can feel incredibly daunting posting your own snaps for your followers to see. But if you\u0027re keen to improve your photo game, there\u0027s a new trend you need to know about. Or more specifically, a new pose. If you take a closer look at any celebrity Instagram account, you might have started to notice a certain similarity between their photos. That\u0027s because they\u0027ve all been doing something very specific with their feet.   Dubbed, \u0027Barbie feet\u0027 by Who What Wear , the stylish pose has taken social media by storm.  But the trick is so simple you\u0027ll kick yourself for not thinking of it before. \u0027Barbie feet\u0027 involves balancing on the balls of your feet, as if wearing an invisible pair of high heels. The shape and position of the foot when doing the pose can be compared to that of a Barbie doll, whose feet are molded into a permanent point - hence the name.  People are opting to strike a pose in this way for one very obvious reason. It\u0027s incredibly flattering It\u0027s no secret that heels are the most flattering form of footwear as they elongate the legs and make them appear slimmer. So Instagram pros are opting to create the illusion of wearing heels to appear more photogenic in places where shoes just aren\u0027t practical.  It\u0027s especially favoured by stars posing in bikinis on the beach with bare feet. Scroll through the Instagram feeds of the likes of Bella Hadid, Victoria Justice, Yovanna Ventura or Kourtney Kardashian and you\u0027ll see the pose in action.

Hana Michels took to Twitter to reveal the bizarre occurance. She shared a snap from her dating profile, which she\u0027s had for over a year. The comedic shot shows Hana in the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, with a shower cap on her head, pulling a face as she brushes her teeth.

Hana tweeted that since launching her profile, 23 men have messaged her to say she is \u0027incorrect about toilet paper\u0027. The post, which has been shared over 2,000 times, provoked a debate about the right direction in which to hang a toilet roll on a holder.  There was a pretty equal split between people who thought her way was right, and people who thought she was wrong. One person said: I don\u0027t have Tinder... but if I did, I\u0027d be trying to find your profile right now just to tell you that you are correct about toilet paper. Another added: Make it 24, you god damned monster. Some people tried to delve into the reasoning for which way you should hang the paper.

A head and a number of bloodied body parts and limbs were found near the scene after at least three illegal hunters were devoured by the predators. Staff at the Sibuya Game Reserve, in Eastern Province, South Africa, called in a helicopter to search the area for more poachers. A vet then had to tranquilise the six lions so police could go inside and recover the remains of the mauled poachers. Owner Nick Fox, 60, said: “We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more. “They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.  “They were clearly intent on killing rhinos and cutting off their horns. “But the lions are our watchers and s and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal. “Whilst we are saddened at any loss of life the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner. The remains of the bodies were found as darkness fell on Tuesday. Staff had to wait until Wednesday morning until the area could be declared safe to go in and recover what was left A police spokeswoman confirmed the grim discovery was made in the lion camp.  Captain Mali Govender said: “We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before. The game reserve is one of the most popular in the Eastern Cape with British tourists and is home to the Big Five of elephant, rhino, buffalo, lion and leopard and is set in 30 square miles. In 2016 the reserve lost three rhinos when poachers got into the park and shot them dead for their horns. Nine rhinos - all of which were shot with a high-calibre hunting rifle - have been killed by poachers on Eastern Cape reserves already this year. It is hoped the gang eaten by lions are responsible for the deaths. The most high profile animal killing in recent times came when American dentist Walter Palmer shot Cecil - a famous lion in Zimbabwe. Palmer killed the black-maned male after the lion was lured from the protected Hwange National Park paying a reported \u0026pound35,000 to hunt the wild beast. The father-of-two then disappeared when he became the target of furious protesters over the execution.

But almost a century ago, we were in the same city, on the same side – fighting a famine. Soviet Russia was convulsed by a civil war and this heartland west of the Ural mountains was gripped by floods and the worst drought in living memory. The average May rainfall for Samara was 38.8mm, but only 0.3 fell. In the paralysing summer heat and subsequent deep frosts of 1921, millions faced starvation and Britons took part in a massive operation to save the children. The crusade was led by Swedish-born Arctic explorer Dr Fridtjof Nansen, whose appeal for funds was published in the Daily Mirror in December that year. His cable from Moscow told of the horror: “Twenty to thirty million are in famine conditions, of whom at least ten million are threatened with death. Whole populations in Central Russia are threatened with extermination. Vast districts becoming empty deserts. Urgent need immediate help. Cannot be exaggerated.” Samara was among the hardest-hit, its plight worsened by the civil war and Lenin’s decree to requisition food from peasant farms to feed his Red Army Troops advancing “war communism”.  Trade union leader Tom Mann, who travelled down the Volga from Samara in July 1921, said: “The scene was such as I have never seen in any degree.” Food from the Swedish Red Cross was already reaching the zones of devastation, but on his return he appealed for help from British workers. Save The Children asked Daily Mirror photographer George Mewes to go to Russia to record scenes of the famine there to raise awareness here. English journalist Sir Philip Gibbs visited the area and reported: “In Samara and hundreds of other places children are left by parents who cannot feed them. In the Samara district there are 28,000 abandoned children, as starved as birds who fall from the nest to the frozen ground.”  Thousands responded to the Mirror’s full-page appeal for “a shilling a week” to Save the Children, which would feed, clothe and get help to the famine region. Three-halfpence could rescue a child from hunger. First World War leader David Lloyd George spoke of “the most terrible devastation that has afflicted the world for centuries” and begged: “This is so appalling that it ought to sweep away every prejudice out of one’s mind and only appeal to one emotion: pity and human sympathy.” The “prejudice” he had in mind was anti-Soviet sentiment. Samara was in the cockpit of the war between Lenin’s Bolshevik revolutionaries – “The Reds” – and “the Whites” led by Admiral Kolchak.  The city was seized by the Bolsheviks in the 1917 October Revolution, but taken back by a “democratic counter-revolution” before finally falling to the Red Army in 1918. There was bitter fighting,  exacerbated by Lenin’s policy of taking grain and animals to sustain the war effort.  Amid growing starvation, some peasants turned to cannibalism, with a trade in human flesh. An aid worker reported : “Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.” Under the headline “Mother turns cannibal”, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: “Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.”   Modern estimates put the human cost of the famine at more than five million lives – so the British reporters and  politicians were not exaggerating.  Sweden’s role in the international relief effort was finally recognised in 2016 with a memorial by the river Volga. Britain’s contribution is less well-documented and largely forgotten but there is no doubt that it helped to “save the children”. And the Save The Children charity, founded in the UK in 1919, received a huge boost to its popularity, confirming its importance over almost a century of work for those most in need. Samara, today a city of 1.2 million people and a conurbation almost three times that, sits on the river Volga more than 600 miles east of Moscow and almost 800 miles north of Volgograd – wartime Stalingrad – where England pummelled Panama 6-1 earlier in the World Cup tournament. Its history began officially in 1586, when a fortress was built to protect Russia’s eastern boundary.  Legend says that Alexius, patron saint of Samara, had visited the site two  centuries earlier, and predicted that a great town would be built there.  That prophecy came true hundreds of years later, when the Soviet government was forced to relocate there from besieged Moscow in the Second World War.

They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus haber sparks speculation his days at dundee are over as he jets off but not with dark blues squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Marcus Haber’s time at Dundee appears to be at an end with the player in talks over a move to South Africa.The player himself sparked speculation over his future after posting pictures of himself on social media.While the Dark Blues first-team squad were heading for a training camp in Portugal’s Algarve yesterday, the Canadian was posting pictures of himself embarking on aThe Tele can confirm that trip is to talk over a switch to the ABSA Premiership, though to which Johannesburg club it’s still unclear.Haber’s first posts showed him at Glasgow airport about to board a flight for London.Later in the day he posted again complaining a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg had been delayed.So far there has been no word of which South African club he may be heading out to join.Since new gaffer Neil McCann took over last year, the 29-year-old has been very much a fringe player.\u0026mdash Dundee Football Club (@dundeefconline) July 4, 2018He only made 13 appearances last term, the final one coming in the 4-1 home defeat at the hands of Ross County in February.He did have back problems that required surgery but even before then it was clear he was no longer first-choice striker.Haber has not been involved in either of the pre-season friendlies to date and is behind Sofien Moussa, new signing Jean Mendy and even kid Matty Henvey in the pecking order.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Friday 6 Jul 2018 4:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

cattle \u0026ndash as a way to explore contemporary issues of sustainability and local culture.\"The new low-impact buildings, which are similar to the highly popular Nordic summer huts, will provide

remains over funding formula","story":"\u0026nbspIMMINENT repairs to an Inverness road which has been dubbed the worst in the city have been welcomed \u0026ndash as a councillor renewed calls for changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem. I think it\u0027 one of the worst roads in the area at the moment.\"Neighbour Sarah Macpherson said: \"It\u0027 become one of the worst roads in Inverness, however I\u0026rsquom glad it\u0027 going to be fixed.\"Local councillor Ian Brown said the road was in \"a terrible state\" and welcomed news it was to be resurfaced.\"It really is awful,\" he said. \"I was there at the weekend and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe how bad it was.\"Roads funding was ring-fenced as part of this year\u0027 cost-cutting budget, but council chiefs have acknowledged that any repairs carried out are likely to be a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed, with a figure of \u0026pound20 million previously quoted as the amount needed simply to maintain routes as they are.Elsewhere, councillors have argued that a \u0026pound1 a night \"tourist tax\" on visitors could be used to specifically address infrastructure problems, including roads.Friday 6 Jul 2018 4:35

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about. It’s amazing.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p.

She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

The mania surrounding the band was so huge, they were put on par with The Beatles as their most successful period was labelled Rollermania, thanks to the hoards of screaming young girls who followed them around.  For years, the band claimed they were swindled out of millions in royalties with some of the members taking action against their old label Arista Records in the US courts.  They split in 1978, with bitter battles over money between band members and managers dragging on for decades, but set in motion a new wave of Rollermania with a return to the concert circuit.  Late in 2015, three of the classic five \u0026ndash Alan, singer Les McKeown and guitarist Stuart \u0026lsquoWoody\u0026rsquo Wood \u0026ndash reunited for a series of shows nearly three decades on from their initial break-up. Hours before taking to the stage at T in the Park at Strathallan Castle estate, Perthshire, in July 2016 \u0026ndash and amid rumours of a dispute between members \u0026ndash Woody announced on social media the gig was to be his last. \u0026ldquoDisappointed is an understatement but outwith my control, he wrote.

They\u0026rsquore also taking the to the global stage with appearances in Japan and Australia \u0026ndash but you\u0026rsquod better not get them mixed up with the Bay City Rollers.  Talking about their ScotFest appearance, plans to come back to Glasgow and about dedicating their ScotFest performance to Alan, Les\u0026rsquo attitude towards this interview \u0026ndash in hindsight \u0026ndash is no frills and refreshingly to-the-point.  Making reference to \u0026ldquothe Bay City Rollers being back, Les quickly corrects: \u0026ldquoThose Bay City Rollers are gone. This is the new Bay City Rollers, the Les McKeown Bay City Rollers.  So, how did the guys get involved with ScotFest? \u0026ldquoThe organisers put in an inquiry and we responded.

Looking to know more about the group coming to Glasgow\u0026rsquos King\u0026rsquos Theatre next April, Les opens up. Glasgow does have that effect on folk, after all.  \u0026ldquoI last played at the Hydro in 2016 and in the Barrowland Ballroom the year before that. I haven\u0026rsquot been to Glasgow in a while, but I\u0026rsquom looking forward to playing the King\u0026rsquos. It\u0026rsquos a classic venue, beautiful theatre. People can just sit back and enjoy the show.  The most poignant moment comes when discussing pal Alan.  There was a great outpouring of support from the across the world of music after the bass guitarist was rushed to hospital on June 7.  He had been described as \u0026ldquoextremely unwell after a virus attacked his organs.  The 69-year-old was on holiday in Mexico with wife Eileen when he fell ill. He was taken to Galenia Hospital in the coastal city of Cancun.  Back in Scotland, Alan lost his fight and passed away after a short stay in hospital on Monday.  Les had planned to travel to Scotland to see Alan the day before ScotFest to visit him in hospital and \u0026ldquocheck in on him and cheer him up because he was \u0026ldquoa really good mate.  However, he quelled fans\u0026rsquo concerns by assuring them the show will go on in Edinburgh. \u0026ldquoAlan always said nothing would stop him from going up on stage, so I\u0026rsquoll make sure I\u0026rsquom on stage dedicating it to him, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe plan on projecting pictures of Alan and the guys having fun and joking around at our shows to show people a good image of Alan.

Under-18s clubs looking to train and use changing rooms at one of Glasgow Life\u0026rsquos seven-a-side grass parks will have to pay an eyewatering \u0026pound12.30-per-hour more than last season.  But the council\u0026rsquos SNP deputy leader David McDonald pointed to reductions in five-a-side fees and synthetic 11-a-side pitch hire as proof that the local authority was making football costs fairer.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos simply not the case to say that pitch fees have increased because across the board there has been a host of changes that have taken place. Yes, it has meant that some prices have gone up, but some prices have come down.  \u0026ldquoElected members will be all too aware of how sensitive issues around football pricing in the city is, perhaps so sensitive that we have inherited a very confused and muddled system.  \u0026ldquoWe are doing all we can to ensure that we increase fairness and access to our football facilities with the ultimate goal of levelling the playing field for clubs across the city.  The previous cost of an 11-a-side grass pitch for two hours, including changing facilities, for adults, was \u0026pound62.60 but that has dropped to \u0026pound60. But for under 18s that has risen from \u0026pound47.30 to \u0026pound48 and for concessions that has dropped from \u0026pound44.10 to \u0026pound36.  For a two-hour hire of the pitch alone, the cost has risen from \u0026pound26.30 to \u0026pound36 for adults, from \u0026pound20 to \u0026pound27 for under-18s and from \u0026pound19 to \u0026pound21.50 for concessions.  The highest increase in costs has been handed out to adults\u0026rsquo teams who train and use changing facilities at seven-a-side grass pitches. They will now pay \u0026pound17.10 more for every hour.  But concessions, including pensioners, those in receipt of state benefits, and asylum seekers, will pay less for six pitch types. That includes paying \u0026pound18.30 less for an 11-a-side indoor pitch.  All age groups will be able to use five-a-side pitches for less, however.  Scotland have not reached a major football tournament in the men\u0026rsquos game since 1998 while the women\u0026rsquos team have never qualified for a World Cup.  A Scottish Football Association\u0026nbspsaid it has more than 300 full-size 3G pitches, with a record 145,000 people having been registered as players last year.  An SFA spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish FA is dedicated to ensuring that the game remains affordable and open to everyone in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile overall responsibility for the pricing of public sector sports facilities rests with local authorities, leisure trusts and the owners and operators of wider facilities, we work closely with these stakeholders to try and ensure that no one is priced out of the game.  It comes as a petition calling on the council to scrap the increased charges has gathered almost 2000 signatures.  George Innes, the head coach of Clyde School of Football started the online campaign. And he said: \u0026ldquoMany clubs are struggling to afford this increase and will see the number of organisations folding this season due to the fact that these prices are unsustainable.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow Life said: \u0026ldquoThe new pricing structure will also allow us to protect our network of 32 Glasgow Club facilities across the city and continue to provide world-class facilities with state-of-the-art equipment at a cost which is competitive and attractive and equal to or better than the private sector."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-whisky-sells-for-over-51000-at-online-auction","story":"  The Bowmore 1966 Samaroli Bouquet was bought for \u0026pound51,611 in an online auction held by Perth-based Whisky Auctioneer, and it attracted more than 50 bids from around the world.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

President Quim Torra, who backs independence for the region, was sworn in by Catalonia\u0027s parliament in May.  He is due to arrive in Scotland on Tuesday following a meeting with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, according to Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar.  He will meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, on Wednesday, Mr Anwar said.  Mr Torra\u0027s visit will follow the latest procedural hearing for Prof Ponsati\u0027s case at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday this week.  It comes ahead of a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Prof Ponsati\u0027s legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, say she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  Her team maintains that the condition of \"dual criminality\" - the issue of establishing equivalent charges in Scots law - is not fulfilled, and a European arrest warrant should not be executed.  However Mr Anwar said the Advocate Depute, acting on behalf of Spain, has advised she faces the equivalent charge of treason in Scots law.  He said: \"Clara Ponsati maintains her innocence of the charges and our instructions remain to robustly defend her from extradition to Spain.  \"Clara regards it as surreal that she is now accused of treason, when the Spanish state blames the Catalan government for executing a law that was voted on in the Catalan Parliament elected by the Catalan people.  \"From the very beginning we have submitted that the condition of dual criminality is not fulfilled in Scotland, and the European arrest warrants should not be executed.\"  READ MORE: \u0027Scotland\u0027s independence day is coming soon\u0027, says Ian Blackford  A Crown Office spokesman said: \"In extradition cases in Scotland, the Crown is required by statute to act on behalf of the requesting state or territory.  \"Once proceedings are active, any question as to the progress of the case is a matter for the court. As this case is active, it would not be appropriate for the Crown to comment further.  \"All proceedings are open to the public and press.\""},{"url":null,"title":"pavilion-theatre-to-open-doors-this-week","story":"  The popular theatre was forced to close after a blaze broke out in Victoria\u0027s nightclub on Sauchiehall Street in March.  The fire caused widespread damage, with the nightclub and area around since being demolished and the surrounding streets remaining closed.  Now operators said they will be gaining access to the theatre this week as plans get underway for its renovation.  Glasgow City Council also said it will reduce the exclusion zone around the areas, allowing full access to footways on Hope Street and Renfield Street.  However it said that the part of Sauchiehall Street between Hope Street and Renfield Street would remain closed, as well as Renfield Lane.  The theatre\u0027s manager Iain Gordon confirmed a grand reopening of the theatre on September 5 to bring it \"back to its former glory\".  The opening will feature a staging of Celtic: The Musical to herald the start of its autumn season.  Sauchiehall Street has been hit by two devastating fires in recent months, including the blaze that destroyed Victoria\u0027s nightclub.

Producers are warning that Scotland\u0026rsquos staple potato crop - already behind thanks to late and deep snow - will struggle in soil baked by weeks of sun and dried out by the wind.  But the same weather threatening our chips and crisps is great for our berries. Farmers are talking about a bumper crop of soft fruit - provided they can find the labour to pick it.  There are real worries, however, about supplies of fodder going in to next winter with Scotland potentially facing a shortage of straw. Some farmers, insiders warn, may have to sacrifice less productive cattle for mince if feedstock prices rise.  Andrew McCornick, president of the National Farmers Union in Scotland, explained the very mixed picture brought for the sector.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year\u0026rsquos difficult harvest.  \u0026ldquoMany farmers and crofters found themselves chasing their tails for the whole of the winter and most of the spring.  \u0026ldquoFrom an arable perspective, the delays in sowing and crop husbandry during the difficult winter and spring, on top of the delays caused by a poor harvest last year, mean that the true effects of the weather will not be truly known until after this year\u0026rsquos harvest.  \u0026ldquoThe recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members who, after suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather previously, have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.  The upside is that the winter fodder harvested so far is good but farmers will be watching the weather carefully to see how much hay they have. They may not be able to swap straw for hay if the grass does not grow well.    Scottish arable farmers used to have so much straw left after they gathered their barley that they burnt it. Now many mash the stalks back in to the ground - even as demand from power generators for the product rises.  But Mr McCornick and other experts have been warning there may not be a lot of straw left this year, for both food and bedding.  He said: \u0026ldquoStraw supplies look like they may become an issue later on in the year and we are encouraging those who will need straw to negotiate a reasonable price sooner rather than later. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoI am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity. That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain. A little bit of moisture would be a great help to grass growth and for those who are relying on a second cut of silage, as well as our arable members who will be looking for some wet weather to swell grain as we quickly approach harvest time.  There may not be much straw but there is plenty of strawberries, which boom in the sushine.  Mr McCornick said: \u0026ldquoEarly reports on the soft fruit harvest suggests exceptional quality, the hot weather fuelling excellent demand and packhouses at full throttle.  Farmers last month reported a glut of the fruit. Aldi, the discount supermarket, took 80 tonnes of extra deliveries and started selling them in bigger punnets.  The crash in the pound means Scottish farmers are struggling to attract pickers from eastern Europe to bring in their harvest. Producers have raised wages and offered signing-on bonuses as workers fail to materialise.  Some farmers in Scotland may benefit from smaller crops of other produce, including English lettuce wilting in high temperatures, meaning lower labour requirements. There are concerns over other products too, including courgettes. Some growers expect supermarket shortages of greens within the next two weeks.  Growers of potatoes and salad crops need water right now as the plants, delayed by the Beast from the East, move in the period when they should bulk up.  Ayrshire new potatoes arrived in the shops a fortnight later than usual as spring arrived late and the March deep cold frosted off young plants. Yields in Ayrshire were down about 10 per cent, according to figures from earlier this month. Crops further south, which appear earlier, were affected even more seriously. Prices are not expected to compensate farmers for smaller crops.  Ice-cream sales, meanwhile, continue to boom, with or without strawberries. Britain may spend as much as a \u0026pound1 billion this year.  Sales across the British Isles are understood to have doubled Waitrose said customers had bought a record number of children\u0026rsquos lollies, up 175 per cent. Adult lollies, it said, grew even faster, by 188 per cent.  The Aberdeenshire ice cream maker Mackie\u0026rsquos said its sales were up more than a quarter from May last year. It sold the equivalent of 1.1m scoops in the month, enough for every man, woman and child in Glasgow to have one each. The business also said sales of ice were roaring."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-independence-day-is-coming-soon-blackford","story":"  The SNP\u0027s Westminster leader warned the Conservative Party\u0027s treatment of Scotland would accelerate separation, as he told of \"real anger\" among Scots at seeing Holyrood and their rights being \"attacked\" by the UK Government.  Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.  At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to \"lower the temperature\" due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.  The SNP\u0027s motion urges the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government \"best suited to their needs\".  Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: \"Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day (debate) on July 4 - independence day (in the United States) - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?\"  After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: \"Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I\u0027ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it\u0027s coming soon.\"  Labour\u0027s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: \"You say Scotland\u0027s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.\"  Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland\u0027s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and \"drive us\" out of Europe.  He also railed against the \"biggest power grab\" conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.  Only about 19 minutes were left for debate on devolution changes linked to the legislation when MPs considered amendments made by the House of Lords last month.  The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.  This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.  The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  Mr Blackford said \"unknown territory\" had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers.  He added: \"If (Scottish Secretary David Mundell) recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.  \"A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.\"  Scottish Secretary David Mundell later said the SNP were guilty of \"power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts\".  He said: \"All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.\"  Earlier Mr Mundell told MPs the debate told the public \"everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence\".  He said: \"They\u0027re like a broken record, it\u0027s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.  \"Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.  \"That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it\u0027s a charade today.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sir-paul-mccartney-announces-first-uk-live-dates-in-three-years","story":"  The Beatles legend, 76, will perform in Liverpool, Glasgow and London in December as part of his Freshen Up tour.

However there were further reports of dissent yesterday after Mrs May, having ditched two previous customs options because of infighting, was said to have settled on a \u0026ldquothird way that was a decidedly soft Brexit.  Around 40 Tory MPs reportedly warned chief whip Julian Smith their party would be \u0026ldquotoast if the Prime Minister abandoned her Brexit red lines.  The third way is understood to involve the UK collecting EU import tariffs, a central plank of the supposedly abandoned \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model, which Boris Johnson dismissed as \u0026ldquocrazy.

At PMQs, Tory Sir Edward Leigh asked if the UK\u0026rsquos negotiating position would be \u0026ldquofull and unfettered control of migration, trade deals, and business law.  Mrs May said Brexit meant an \u0026ldquoindependent trade policy, Westminster sovereignty and an end to free movement but did not say anything was unfettered.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell and Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford are due to discuss the White Paper with Cabinet office minister David Lidington this morning.  However they said the process was becoming nonsensical because the UK government refused to share basic information about the content.  In a joint letter, they complained a recent low-level meeting of ministers had been was \u0026ldquounsatisfactory because they were \u0026ldquonot permitted to see a single word of the draft White Paper in advance, and could only contribute on the basis of brief, oral summaries.  \u0026ldquoWe therefore wish to make it absolutely clear that we will not regard any discussion of the White Paper at Thursday\u0026rsquos JMC (EN) as meaningful, unless we have been given prior access to the text of the draft White Paper as it currently stands, they wrote.  Threatening to denounce the JMC as a joke if nothing charged, they added: \u0026ldquoIf we do not have this opportunity, we will have to make it very clear that we have been given no real possibility to consider, let alone influence the content of a document which will purport to speak on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom, about matters, many of which are devolved... of the greatest possible importance to the people of Scotland and Wales.  Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos meeting is an important point for us to take stock with the Scottish and Welsh Governments. We are determined to get the best possible Brexit deal for all parts of the UK. This is a good opportunity for those of us in the UK Cabinet to hear what the devolved governments have to say."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-walk-glasgow-dozens-of-city-roads-set-to-close-for-annual-boyne-parade","story":"  Closures will start at 9.30am and will continue until around 12.30pm to allow the parade access.

Mr Salmond lost Gordon last year after the biggest swing to the Tories anywhere in the UK.  To the dismay of many former colleagues, he has since worked as a TV presenter on the Alex Salmond Show on the Kremlin-backed RT channel.  The 63-year-old was asked about his intentions at a recent meeting of the SNP\u0027s Aberdeenshire East branch,\u0026nbspthe Daily Record reported.  Asked if he was would stand again for Gordon in the event of a snap election this year, the paper reported that he said he had set his sights \u0026ldquofurther north, referring to neighbouring Banff \u0026amp Buchan.  An SNP source also told the Herald\u0026nbspMr Salmond made the \u0026ldquofurther north remark, but admitted Mr Salmond loves to tease an audience.  However Ms Salmond has now rejected both the words attributed to him and the thrust of the story.  He told the Herald: \"Story is wrong. I said no such thing.\"  Pressed on whether the thrust of the story was accurate, if not\u0026nbspthe quote, he said: \"Story is just wrong - not just words but sense as well.\"  Mr Salmond, who lives in Banff \u0026amp Buchan, hinted at a return to politics the night he lost Gordon to Tory Colin Clark, saying: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove not seen the last of my bonnets and me.  Mr Salmond lost after a massive tactical vote by LibDem supporters, who backed the Tories in protest over a second independence referendum.  However the result in Banff \u0026amp Buchan was far more polarised, with previous SNP supporters appearing to switch directly to the Tories, giving Mr Clark a majority of 3,693.  Mr Salmond\u0027s residual personal vote in the constituency could tempt some back to the SNP.  The SNP is officially on a campaign footing because of the extraordinary feuding in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet over Brexit, and her fragility as PM.  But the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means there would only be an election if Tory MPs voted for it, and there is no appetite among them for walking into a potential defeat.  SNP deputy leader Keith Brown has been tasked with starting to organise candidate selections over the summer to help get the party ready for any vote or referendum.  A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond was given his jotters by the people of Gordon in spectacular style last year.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquod get a similar response from voters in Banff \u0026amp Buchan.

Mrs Leadsom said it was \"entirely in order\" for the SNP to vote, but condemned them for \"staggering\" through the lobbies - preventing MPs, doorkeepers and other Commons staff from watching the game.  Votes on motions linked to public spending could only take place from 7pm - the kick-off time for England\u0027s second round tie.  Five votes occurred, including one regarding devolution, and took approximately 66 minutes.  The SNP\u0027s Commons leader Pete Wishart called for the implementation of electronic voting as he raised the issue after Mrs Leadsom delivered the Business Statement.  He said: \"I understand some of my Conservative friends got just a wee bit upset on Tuesday evening for having to vote on an estimates process, and apparently just by doing their job it got in the way of being able to cheer on the national English football team.  \"Well apparently it\u0027s all the fault of us nasty Scot Nats for daring to vote in a parliamentary democracy, how dare we.  \"But salvation is on its way and there is a solution available for my footy-fixated Tory friends: and that is just to stop wandering round and round aimlessly for 20 minutes in a head count in stuffed division lobbies, and try and introduce some modern voting facilities and come into the 21st century.\"Mrs Leadsom replied: \"I think what I would observe is that the Scottish Nationalist Members of Parliament should certainly not be playing in the World Cup due to their slowness of the 33 of them through the lobby.  \"They showed no ability to sprint, and whilst it is entirely in order for them to vote at all times as was pointed out on the day, nevertheless, for the Sergeant at Arms to have to go twice into the lobby to find out what was causing such a delay for 33 of them to stagger through didn\u0027t only prevent those wanting to watch the football from this chamber, but it also prevented the doorkeepers, the many staff who support us.  \"And it was just plain mean to do that.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8028173.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-new-scots-homes-bankrolled-by-record-european-loan","story":"  The Wheatley Group unveiled \u0026pound185 million of new funding from the European Investment Bank to help build and improve thousands of affordable homes across Scotland in a landmark deal hailed as by the First Minister as a benefit of Scotland\u0027s EU links.  It also marks a significant step in the wider push to tackle homelessness, high-rents and other housing hardships.  As part of the groundswell Wheatley Group earlier linked up with Edinburgh social enterprise Social Bite, which started as a sandwich bar and won the high-profile support of Prince Harry and George Clooney, to provide flats in Glasgow and across central Scotland for homeless people through the charity Housing First.  The EIB loan, described as being \"by far the largest of its type made in Scotland\", is linked to a commitment by Wheatley to invest \u0026pound400m over the next three years in affordable housing.    Above: Jonathan Taylor,\u0026nbsp Amy Rigby, Nicola Sturgeon, Kyle Wilson  This also includes refurbishing existing homes to meet new Scottish and EU energy-efficiency standards, helping tenants cut energy bills, and housing and integrating refugees into communities.  The deal was announced in Glasgow by EIB vice president Jonathan Taylor at a community event attended by Nicola Sturgeon and tenants, staff and apprentices from across Wheatley, along with local politicians, business, community and social housing leaders.  It takes the amount of funding raised by Wheatley in the past four years to \u0026pound800m and comes in the week the group was confirmed \u0026ndash for the second year running \u0026ndash as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes.  Wheatley is forging ahead with an ambitious building programme, from 2015 through to 2025, of 7,500 affordable new homes across the country in communities including Balloch, Dumbarton, Glasgow, West Lothian, Edinburgh and North Berwick.  Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government is committed to reaching its target of 50,000 new affordable homes in three years time \"ensuring people have access to quality housing is a fundamental part of building a fair and equal society\".  She said the deal is \"also another reminder of how Scotland benefits from the EU and its institutions\".  Martin Armstrong, Wheatley chief executive, said the loan enables expansion \"but it is about so much more than simply bricks and mortar\".  \"Wheatley\u0026rsquos mission is to make lives, not just homes, better.\"  The group comprises six registered social landlords: Glasgow Housing Association, Dunedin Canmore, Cube Housing Association, Loretto Housing, West Lothian Housing Partnership and Barony Housing Association.  Alastair MacNish, Wheatley chairman, said: \u0026ldquoIt will help us to consolidate our position as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes, which we hold close as a badge of honour at a time when the availability and supply of affordable housing is such an acute priority.  Mr Taylor, speaking at the funding announcement at the Reidvale Neighbourhood Centre in Gallowgate, Glasgow, where GHA, is building 143 homes, said: \"New investment in social housing is crucial to increase the number of affordable homes and cut heating bills in existing properties.  \"This week\u0026rsquos visit to Glasgow provides a valuable opportunity to see how upgrading existing properties and construction of new social housing will improve lives, create skilled jobs, benefit local suppliers and cut heating bills in homes for hundreds of families.  The new \u0026pound185m EIB loan, along with future investments, will enable Wheatley to maintain a building programme of around 650 homes a year from 2021 to early 2025."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-facing-cabinet-backlash-over-last-ditch-brexit-plan","story":"  The Prime Minister was criticised by leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg and former ministers who said she had abandoned her own red line on quitting the EU single market.  One MP called it a \u0026ldquobotch and a \u0026ldquocomplete mess that broke Tory manifesto promises.  The ferocious backlash piles pressure on pro-Brexit cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to reject Mrs May\u0026rsquos soft Brexit idea at a crunch meeting at Chequers today.  The pair tonight conferred with Brexit Secretary David Davis and other Eurosceptic ministers, including Esther Mcvey and Andrew Leadsom, in Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos office.  It followed reports that Mr Davis was also unhappy about the plan, telling Mrs May the EU would reject it because it would rely on the UK policing EU import tariffs.  Despite backing a single market in goods, the 100-page paper says the UK should diverge from EU rules on services, something Brussels has already dismissed as cherry picking.  After months of kicking the can down the road to avoid walk-outs from her divided cabinet, today\u0027s\u0026nbspmeeting is supposed to settle the UK\u0026rsquos preferred Brexit plan for customs and trade.  A White Paper next week should then form the basis of negotiations with the 27 other EU nations before the October deadline for a EU-UK deal.  Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs May said she had gathered her cabinet \u0026ldquoto decide on a substantive way forward.  Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were now entering a \u0026ldquocrucial phase.  The UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike trade deals is seen as a cornerstone of Brexit by its supporters.  However papers given to the Cabinet for the crunch meeting at Chequers about the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint propose a \u0026ldquoharmonisation of UK and EU rules that could scupper this.  They said the UK should make an \u0026ldquoupfront choice to align its rules with the rest of Europe on goods and agriculture, something which would antagonise the US in particular.  Donald Trump\u0026rsquos commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already said he wants a post-Brexit UK to open itself up to US goods such as GM crops and chlorinated chicken, which are banned under EU standards, as part of broader transatlantic trading arrangements.  But the Chequers paper says \u0026ldquothe UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food, acknowledging this \u0026ldquowould not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal as the UK could not recognise US standards.  Mr Rees-Mogg, chair of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said ending the UK\u0026rsquos regulatory alignment with Europe was a \u0026ldquored line and Mrs May should tear up the plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is not Brexit. This common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state. This would be directly contrary to the Prime Minister\u0027s own assurances.\"  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the plan was a botch, a complete mess and a \u0026ldquocomplete breach of Mrs May\u0026rsquos manifesto commitments to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe could not eliminate tariffs to reduce prices for consumers and businesses, or strike free trade deals. This would deny the economy the full benefits of Brexit... and be completely at odds with what 17.4m voted for. We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.  Former Brexit minister David Jones added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, this is not what people voted for in 2016. This is not Brexit.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said the Tories had become \u0026ldquothe lemming party.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell repeatedly refused to rule out resignations when Mrs May\u0026rsquos deeply divided cabinet assembles at her country retreat today.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think there will be robust discussions. Of course people have strong views in relation to leaving the EU. But at the end of the day it\u0027s about reaching an agreement.  \"I\u0027m confident that we can, and everybody should rally round that.  He said he would ensure any deal protected \u0026ldquothe integrity of the United Kingdom.  After a meeting with UK ministers in London on Thursday, Mr Russell published a list of demands - mostly the status quo - the SNP government wants to see in the UK blueprint.  Sebastian Kurtz, the Austrian Chancellor, said he would support delaying Brexit beyond March 2019 to allow more time for talks to ensure the Irish border issue was resolved.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur goal is to reach agreement [on the border]. If that\u0026rsquos not possible we need to avoid a hard Brexit. If not, it\u0026rsquos good to keep negotiating.  Asked if that meant extending the two-year Article 50 process, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll see?  Meanwhile Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies including BMW, Lufthansa and ThyssenKrupp said it needed \u0026ldquocertainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later over Brexit or German investment in the UK would suffer.  Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u0026rsquos biggest vehicle manufacturer employing 40,000 people, this week said a bad Brexit would force it to rethink an \u0026pound80bn investment in the UK.  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the government was playing \u0026ldquoRussian roulette with tens of thousands of jobs by a government that \u0026ldquoplaces its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country.  Jaguar boss Dr Ralf Speth said the firm and its suppliers faced an \u0026ldquounpredictable future if frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market ended with Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-asked-of-russia-after-novichok-couple-handled-contaminated-item","story":"  It comes after police say a couple who are critically ill may have been exposed to Novichok from handling a contaminated item.  Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are currently fighting for their lives in hospital after being poisoned by the toxic chemical substance in Amesbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend.  It follows the highly publicised attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid has demanded that the Kremlin provide an explanation for the two episodes, which investigators believe may be linked.  In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Javid said: \"The eyes of the world are currently on Russia, not least because of the World Cup.  \"It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.\"  Making clear that the UK will \"stand up to the actions that threaten our security\", he added: \"It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison.\"  Mr Javid told MPs that he \"cannot rule out\" the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack.  However the Russian Embassy has hit back, accusing the Government of trying to \"muddy the waters\" and \"frighten its own citizens\".  Officers were called to a home in Muggleton Road on Saturday morning when 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess collapsed.  They were called back later that day when Charlie Rowley, 45, also fell ill.  Because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple\u0027s hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or reciprocal -- such as a vial or syringe -- used to transport the nerve agent for the initial attack on the Skripals and discarded in a public place.  Novichok remains highly toxic for a considerable period of time, so even the tiniest trace remaining in a container picked up by the victims could account for their severe illness.  It was initially believed that the two patients had possibly been using drugs from a contaminated batch, police said.  But after further tests, authorities declared a major incident and on Wednesday night counter-terror police assumed responsibility for the investigation after the Government\u0027s Porton Down laboratory concluded that the pair had been exposed to Novichok.  In a press conference, Chief Constable Kier Pritchard of Wiltshire Police defended his force\u0027s initial response, saying that he \"fully supports\" the decisions taken by officers who thought the couple had initially fallen ill after taking illegal drugs.  Amid questions about the post-Salisbury clean-up operation, Home Secretary Javid said the risk to the public remained low.  He added: \"We have taken a very robust approach to decontamination and there is no evidence that either the man or the woman in hospital visited any of the places that were visited by the Skripals.  \"Our strong working assumption is that the couple came into contact with the nerve agent in a different location to the sites which have been part of the original clean-up operation.\"  Earlier yesterday, Security Minister Ben Wallace said the Amesbury couple were not directly targeted.  Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"The working assumption would be that these are victims of either the consequence of the previous attack, or something else, but not that they were directly targeted.\"  Linking the incident to the attack on the Skripals, Mr Wallace said: \"I think what we said at the time was that this was a brazen and reckless attack in the heart of a very peaceful part of the United Kingdom, and that is part of the anger I feel about the Russian state is that they chose to use clearly a very, very toxic, highly dangerous weapon.\"  Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Salisbury is \"very much open for business\" after residents raised fears that the new case will hamper the local economy.  The Met said that around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network are working alongside colleagues from Wiltshire police.  Six sites visited by Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess before they fell ill have been cordoned off. Police have extended this to include all of Muggleton Road and outside the supported living where Ms Sturgess lived.  Debbie Stark, deputy director for Public Health England in the South West, said that anyone who may have been in any of the cordoned-off areas after 10pm last Friday should take some precautionary measures about washing clothing and cleaning jewellery.  The episode in Salisbury - the first use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War - sparked international outrage.  Mr Skripal and his daughter have since left hospital.  A Russian Embassy spokesman said: \"All allegations of Russia\u0027s involvement in the incidents in Salisbury and Amesbury are merely speculative and are not based on objective data of the investigation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"broch players to strike a pose at bridal bash","story":"        The largest wedding and gift exhibition in the north east, the Big Buchan Bridal Bash, will return to Fraserburgh later this year.

Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy.

I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Friday 6 Jul 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat

children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as

Mr Salmond represented the Aberdeenshire constituency of Banff and Buchan from 1987-2010 in the House of Commons, but when he made his return to Westminster he won in the Gordon constituency in 2015, before being defeated last year by Conservative Colin Clark.             The Daily Record reported today that the former First Minister told a meeting of his local party that if Brexit led to a general election, he would be tempted to stand ‘further North’ than Gordon, taken to be a reference to Banff and Buchan.            However, when contacted by the Scotsman Mr Salmond denied the reporting, claiming he had ‘said no such thing’ at the meeting in question.The ex-SNP leader also said he had nothing to add to his recent speech in Morningside, where he claimed Scottish Independence was inevitable.READ MORE: Alex Salmond prepared to return to frontline for Indyref2The Conservatives also won the Banff and Buchan seat from the SNP at the snap general election of last year, and if Mr Salmond stood he would be attempting to overturn David Duguid’s 3693 majority, more than 1,000 votes higher than the majority in Gordon.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762978.1530605465!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey i m struggling to cope with success","story":"\t\tAbscesses, insomnia and migraines - Orwell Prize winner Darren McGarvey writes candidly about his mental and emotional struggle with success.\t\t\t\tIt’s 1.38 on Monday morning and, in an abandoned hotel foyer at the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, I am about to start writing my column. I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.

But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement.

Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

Two leading Brexiteer cabinet ministers, David Davis and Liam Fox, have told her that plans to combine a customs partnership and technological checks at the UK’s borders cannot be delivered, with Mr Fox said to be considering his position.            Meanwhile, the Scottish Government has repeated its call for the Prime Minister to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, with the SNP’s Brexit minister Michael Russell telling Mrs May to “grow up” and “wake up to reality”.            Mr Russell held talks with UK counterparts in London, and said afterwards that the Scottish Government had no confidence that a draft white paper set to be approved by Mrs May’s Cabinet on Friday could even be delivered.Instead, the government in Edinburgh has produced its own, rival white paper repeating its demands to stay in the single market and customs union, and maintain free movement between the UK and the EU.READ MORE: Michael Sturrock: No deal on data post-Brexit would be devastating“The paper will indicate to people that we have a practical and workable solution for the problems that the UK Government is facing,” Mr Russell said.“What we read of the solutions they are putting forward are neither practical or workable.”He added: “This is a comprehensive document…. it says how we should be dealing with issues and we are trying to say to the UK Government, please grow up, listen to what is real.            “I was in Strasbourg earlier this week. I spoke to members of the European Parliament and members of the [EU] Commission. Everybody uses the same word - reality. The UK Government has to wake up to reality.”Scottish Secretary David Mundell pledged to put forward the Scottish Government\u0027s proposals at Chequers, even though he said \"on a fundamental level, we don’t agree because the Scottish Government doesn’t want to leave the EU.\"\"Leaving the EU is about leaving the single market because it’s not possible to be in the single market and not be in the EU,\" he said. \"I’ll be arguing strongly that our businesses get the best possible access to those markets.\"Mr Mundell added that his \"fundamental requirement\" was the \"integrity of the united kingdom as we leave the EU\" and said he was \"not going to agree or let happen” any backstop plan for the Irish border that creates trade barriers in the Irish sea between Norther Ireland and Britain.            The Scottish Secretary appealed for unity among his cabinet colleagues, warning that \"we have to have a united position in this country as to what we want to achieve, because that’s the most likely way of getting what we want.\"However, on the eve of the day-long talks at the Prime Minister’s Buckinghamshire retreat, ministers voiced skepticism about the so-called \"third way\" to solve problem of post-Brexit customs and preventing a hard border with Northern Ireland.A proposed \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would see technology used to determine where goods arriving into the UK will ultimately end up.This would allow the correct tariff to be paid - either at the UK or EU rate.READ MORE: Theresa May warned UK ‘won’t be an equal’ after BrexitMr Davis is understood to have written to Mrs May, arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU.

Scotland\u0026#8217s independence day is \u0026#8220coming soon\u0026#8221, Ian Blackford has claimed during a bad-tempered Commons debate.                The SNP’s Westminster leader warned the Conservative Party’s treatment of Scotland would accelerate separation, as he told of “real anger” among Scots at seeing Holyrood and their rights being “attacked” by the UK Government.            Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.            For the UK Government, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the SNP were guilty of “power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts”.At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to “lower the temperature” due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.READ MORE: Ian Blackford reshuffles SNP Westminster teamThe SNP’s motion, approved unopposed, urged the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government “best suited to their needs”.Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: “Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day [debate] on July 4 - independence day [in the United States] - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?”            After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: “Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I’ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it’s coming soon.”Labour’s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: “You say Scotland’s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.”Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and “drive us” out of Europe.He also railed against the “biggest power grab” conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.            The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers “significant further powers” to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are “not normal circumstances applying” - describing Brexit as such an exception.READ MORE: Anger  over ‘Tory dark money’Mr Blackford said “unknown territory” had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament’s powers.            He added: “If [Mr Mundell] recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.“A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.”Mr Mundell later said: “All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.”He also told MPs the debate told the public “everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence”.Mr Mundell said: “They’re like a broken record, it’s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.“Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.“That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it’s a charade today.”Shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird warned the “flaming of the fires” of a second independence is being “fanned” by the UK Government.The Labour MP said: “The complete inability of the UK Government to negotiate Brexit layered on top of the inability of the UK Government to engage in a meaningful way with the Scottish Government on Brexit has led us down this path.”Ms Laird also accused the SNP of having shown “contempt” for issues of constituents by its choice of topic for debate.Stephen Kerr, Conservative MP for Stirling, said: “The SNP government in Edinburgh agitating for a second independence referendum is a betrayal of the principle of popular sovereignty.“When the people have spoken as they did, it is time for government to shut up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

During 2017/18, more than 3,700 Highland pupils benefited from a school clothing grant.\nThe additional funding will be allocated to top up the existing rate, taking the council\u0026rsquos grant amount to \u0026pound140 per pupil.\n\"This exceeds the \u0026pound100 minimum amount agreed with the Scottish Government by \u0026pound40 from academic year 2018/19,\" a council spokesperson said today (Monday June 18).\nCouncillor Alister MacKinnon, chair of the corporate resources committee, added: \"Passing on 100% the funding from the Scottish Government for school clothing grants is the right thing to do for our school pupils.\n\"The austerity cuts continue to place many families in financial hardship and low income families in Highland. A grant of \u0026pound140 per pupil will help our learners to participate in school life and ease the financial pressures for parents and carers. I urge all eligible families to apply for this grant.\"\nCouncillor Andrew Baxter, care, learning and housing chair, said \"Providing this level of financial assistance with the costs of school clothing for eligible families means that Highland pupils are better equipped to attend school and to focus on their education without the stigma of wearing clothes that simply don\u0026rsquot fit. Assisting parents and carers with the costs of school clothing can help to alleviate poverty in the Highlands. \"\nLeader of the Council Councillor Margaret Davidson commented: \"The average cost of clothing primary and secondary school pupils in Highland is now estimated to range from around \u0026pound106 to \u0026pound130 per pupil which is a significant outlay for parents. I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018. To streamline the application process, the council has a single application form for school clothing grants and free school meals. They are available from the operations team on 01463 703645.\nHelp with completing the form is also available from the welfare support team: Freephone 0800 090 1004.\nPictured: Councillors MacKinnon

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 6 Jul 2018 4:39
