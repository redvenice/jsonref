Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The Government has been forced to defend the level of spending on the cybersecurity agency leading the response to the ransomware attacks on the health service. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan said investment in the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had trebled this year as this year’s funding of €5.1 million was criticised in the Dáil. Figures compiled by The  show that such investment amounted to less than €14 million, not including payroll costs, over the past decade.Mr Martin insisted funding had been “significantly increased” for the NCSC.‘Criminal hacking’Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney discussed the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Monday.A spokesman for Mr Coveney said the hacking of the health service was briefly discussed on a scheduled call related to UN Security Council business. He added that the “criminal hacking of the health service was strongly criticised by both countries”.The group which created the Conti ransomware used in the attack is sometimes known as Wizard Spider and is based in Russia. It has been known to license out its ransomware products in return for a share of any profits.Separately, cybersecurity experts are examining data posted on the internet claiming to be from the Health Service Executive ransomware attack. However, as of now, there is no indication the data came from HSE servers. The data is heavily redacted and does not appear to contain sensitive information. Data dumpOfficials continue to monitor dozens of “data dump” sites for signs of hacked data being posted online. It is thought the cybercriminals may post a sample of the data to show they are in possession of it and are willing to leak it. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told the Dáil that five patient files which have been put up online were “heavily redacted” and it is not yet clear whether they are genuine. The HSE said restoration of its computer systems would take “many weeks” following last week’s cyberattack.The complete rebuilding of its computer network could take several months, according to sources. Hospitals and other services have been asked to plan for operating essential services “within contingency arrangements” for the next two weeks.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"d%C3%A1il unexpectedly passes sf motion seeking dublin affordable housing for 230 000","story":"The Dáil has unexpectedly passed a Sinn Fein motion on affordable housing after the Government apparently failed to vote on its own countermotion. The  motion, calls for affordable housing to be delivered with a maximum cost in Dublin of €230,000.Sinn Fein housing spokesman Eoin O Broin said that to make a serious dent in the affordable housing crisis the Government must spend €2.8 billion annually to build 20,000 social and affordable homes each year for the next five years. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe Dail has unexpectedly passed a Sinn Fein motion on affordable housing after the Government apparently failed to vote on its own countermotion.The Sinn Fein motion, which is non-binding, calls for affordable housing to be delivered with a maximum cost in Dublin of €230,000 and less outside the capital and with monthly rental costs of €700 to €900. It also called for capital investment to be doubled with €2.8 billion spending on public housing every year with 20,000 affordable homes constructed annually.The Government apparently failed to move its own countermotion, no vote was recorded and the Sinn Fein motion was passed.The single most important thing the Government can do to address the housing crisis is to “dramatically increase capital investment”, the Dail was told.Sinn Fein housing spokesman Eoin O Broin said that to make a serious dent in the affordable housing crisis the Government must spend €2.8 billion annually to build 20,000 social and affordable homes each year for the next five years.The structure of financing and delivery should be based on an average purchase price in Dublin of €230,000 and less elsewhere with average rent of between €700 and €900 a month.He was speaking as he introduced his private member’s motion on housing. Government policy, he said “has allowed big investors to swallow up increasing volumes of limited supply of family homes, denying thousands of people from owning their own homes and forcing them to rent at extortionate prices well into the future”.Minister of State Peter Burke told TDs €620 million has been made available for affordability measures and homes will range from €160,000-€310,000. Local authority-led direct build affordable housing “will be the central plank of the Government’s plans”, he stressed.He was speaking as the Government met to consider proposals to deal with the controversy over funds snapping up estates.Earlier Taoiseach Micheal Martin called for the support of the Opposition to pass legislative measures expected to be introduced in the Dail on Wednesday night to combat investment funds outbidding first time buyers.He was responding to Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald who warned that the Government must end “all sweetheart tax arrangements enjoyed by these institutional funds”.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe announced he will impose a 10 per cent stamp duty on purchases of 10 or more residential homes.Ms McDonald had warned that the stamp duty charged for multiple homes should be more than 15 per cent because Britain had it set at that rate and had to raise it again because it was insufficient to combat multiple purchases.She also warned against exempting apartments from the Government’s measures, otherwise half of all homes built in Co Dublin would be excluded as would six out of seven homes overall.During the Dail debate on affordable housing Mr O Broin said the cause of the housing crisis is “an over-reliance on the private sector - developer-led planning, developer-led taxation and developer-led delivery”.Sinn Fein Finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said that since 2012 house prices have doubled and since 2016 they had jumped by 30 per cent with rents rising by 44 per cent. He said that in his Donegal constituency rents rose by 7 per cent in the past year alone.Labour TD Duncan Smith said there was huge anger out in the community which would continue and the crisis meant that a lost generation for whom home ownership was out of reach, was in danger of becoming two lost generations.Social Democrats housing spokesman Cian O’Callaghan that what was lost in determining policy “is a realisation of the huge human cost that housing unaffordability has” and the heartrending stress and anxiety it causes."},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

What makes the book so dangerous to preserve, its association with Anne, actually becomes the main reason for preserving it when Elizabeth I comes to the throne (in 1558) and wants her mother to be remembered.“Mary Hill was a very close friend of Elizabeth I, so a poignant and likely possibility is that Mary was able to show Elizabeth her mother’s signed inscription in the book.”While the possession of the book would have been risky during Henry’s lifetime, Ms McCaffrey believes the erasure of signatures and messages written below prayers in the Book of Hours likely occurred much later.Anne’s inscription would have been considered more valuable to collectors than those of the obscure other women, Ms McCaffrey said, and their writing may have been scrubbed from the manuscript in preparation for sale.Ms McCaffrey intends to continue research into the 500-year-old book to discover who owned the volume during the centuries between the Hill family and Lord Astor.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits should envy first amendment not knock","story":"Of course one can see where Prince Harry is coming from. He and his spouse appear to find free speech – which is what the first amendment protects – to be a problem. It allows the press to write things about them that they have not permitted the press to write. But all rich people must suffer this irritation. It is one of the reasons why the first amendment is so important and why Britain could do with having a similar founding principle.To Prince Harry’s north, in Canada, citizens can be subjected to inquisition at so-called Human Rights Tribunals if they say something that offends current religious or gender dogmas. Here in Britain someone may have their name marked by the police so that future employers keep away from them as a prospective employee. All for no reason other than the expression of an unpopular (or on occasion distinctly popular) opinion. America’s first amendment, by contrast, protects people’s right to have their ideas out in the widest and noisiest contestation possible.I have seen for myself on a number of occasions how vital it is. For instance some years ago it was easy for wealthy Islamists to shut down any description of their activities in the UK. We relied on the American press to tell the truth of what was going on in Britain. The reform of our libel laws in the last decade went some way to amending this situation. But it still remains the case that on a range of issues – from issues of national security to those of personal identity – our country is hampered by the fact that too often an inidual’s right to free speech is trumped by other considerations and our public debate suffers as a consequence.Of course, free speech doesn’t always win out in America, either. But it has a better fighting chance. So I wouldn’t knock the First Amendment. Doing so shows a certain jejune mindset. Given time perhaps even Prince Harry may see that the amendment in question is one of America’s crown jewels. One that any sensible British person should marvel at.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dissing family blasting first amendment has prince harry lost","story":"How ‘bonkers’ that the US First Amendment allows media organisations to capitalise on Prince Harry’s pain and grief – as he himself said on Armchair Expert, a podcast by US actor Dax Shepard, last week. Harry’s pain and grief is, of course, a privately-owned asset from which only Harry himself should be able to profit – indeed, just like his royal title, which he and his wife tried to trademark as their personal brand. If you don’t want to have your pain and grief reported around the world, on the other hand, there is a way of preventing that happening: which is to avoid giving interviews on podcasts and on prime time TV. The reason that tabloids and glossy magazines are able to titillate their readers with Harry’s inner angst is, of course, because he keeps putting it into the public domain himself.What keeps Princess Alexandra (to pick another random royal) awake, awake at night? What angst did she go through when her father, the Duke of Kent, was killed in a plane crash in 1942, when she was aged six? What morass of feelings did she experience when her daughter, Marina, went off the rails in her teens, when mother and daughter were alleged to have engaged in furious rows? I honestly have no idea, which is perhaps related to the fact she hasn’t signed a deal with Netflix, and indeed doesn’t tend to give interviews at all.Can Harry really be so dim as to lack the awareness that the thing he complains most about – intrusion on his and his family’s privacy – is being fuelled by his own actions? I can’t imagine he can’t see that in promoting himself as a celebrity victim he is encouraging people to write about him, photograph him, tweet about him and all the rest. Surely he knows it is part of the pact he has signed with the devil – without the whole world talking about him, he would be of little economic value to Netflix or any other media organisation.But then I do wonder about Harry’s grip on reality. Listening to his Armchair Expert podcast, what strikes me is just how contradictory and bizarre he can be. One moment he is blasting the First Amendment for enabling a ‘feeding frenzy’ in his new home north of LA – which apparently includes helicopters and drones circling his home making it virtually impossible for him to go outdoors. The next moment he is saying how he can do things in California – like walking around “feeling a little more free” or taking Archie on the back of his bicycle -- which he could never have done in London. Indeed he said he felt so relaxed walking around Montecito, where he lives, that his “shoulders have dropped”. Unfortunately, the kind of soft interviewers to which he and Meghan are apt to bare their souls are too polite to point out when he has just contradicted himself: either Moncecito is a paparazzi-infested hellhole or it isn’t.But there is one comment of Prince Harry’s which made my jaw drop more than any other. Talking about the increasing tendency of celebrities to spew out their inner feelings, he said: “the worse the world gets, the harder it becomes, the more suffering that there is, the more people feel they have something relatable”.Does the sixth in line to the throne really believe that the world is becoming a place of ever-greater human suffering? True, we might be in the midst of a pandemic which has killed over 3 million people, but we have had somewhat worse to cope with in the past – like the Spanish flu of 191819 which killed 50 million, for starters. And that is not to mention world wars, famines and so on. On just about any measure of human development you care to take – hunger, famine, war – there has been a marked improvement in living standards over the course of Prince Harry’s lifetime. In 1984 – the year he was born – average life expectancy around the world was 62.6 years now it is 71.7. In 1980, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, 26.5 percent of people in developing countries were undernourished now it is 12.9 percent (of a far greater population). In 1984, 237,000 were killed in conflict around the world. In 2016 – the latest year for which a global figure has been calculated – it was 87,000.

Reader, I have to report that bets were even placed on the outcome.Descending below the clouds over Sussex, the South Downs were bathed in sunlight, and the captain informed us we were 15 minutes ahead of schedule. A favourable portent? Or did it just mean we would start to queue a bit sooner than expected?Then, as the wheels touched the ground, rain started splatting against the windows. A bad omen, surely. Journalists on the flight sharpened their metaphorical pencils to write about passport Armageddon.The doors opened, we rounded the corner to the UK Border, to be greeted by… nothing. Not a soul in sight, just a row of passport desks manned by yawning border guards. If Carlsberg did passport control, as the old ad campaign might have said, it would look like this.After a cursory glance by staff at Covid test certificates and passenger locator forms, it was on to the electronic passport gates where, after pulling down my mask for the camera, the glass barriers swished aside and I was free.From stepping off the plane (at a gate just yards from passport control) to getting “land side” had taken just four minutes. I felt like making a run for it in case there had been some sort of mistake.Had Heathrow and British Airways, knowing a number of journalists were returning from Lisbon to test the system, conspired to arrange for every other plane to be “accidentally” held back? Doubtful in the age of Twitter, where they surely would have been busted by angry passengers.Had the Home Office sorted every glitch and conjured up extra border guards? Also a bit far-fetched.The rather more prosaic explanation was almost certainly that arriving back on a Tuesday afternoon in May is a rather different prospect from landing on a Saturday in July or August.If you want to fly to Portugal you will need to have with you:Not that the return journey had been entirely hassle-free: having been Covid tested before flying out, I had to be Covid tested before flying back, which involved testing myself while being watched on video call by a qualified medic over a dodgy hotel Wi-Fi connection.The ever-patient Alex from testing firm Qured had to repeat himself more times than I could count, but observed the all-important moment when I chimney-swept my nose and verified I had indeed dropped exactly four drops of solution on the lateral flow cartridge. He even asked me quiz questions while I waited for the test to start working, at no extra charge.Then it was on to the passenger locator form to tell the Home Office where I will be until I (hopefully) test negative two days after my return. Don’t bother trying to do it on your mobile phone is my only advice for that one.If you’re going on a one-day business trip abroad, it may seem more like an exercise in form-filling than in getting any actual work done. But if you’re off for a two-week holiday, and you can stand the £150 per person cost of all the tests, it will be your holiday memories, not locator forms, that will stay with you. Just pray those eight-hour queues never return.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine roll children faces backlash","story":"The Government is facing a backlash over plans to extend the vaccine rollout to children, with some experts questioning the benefits of the proposed move.Dozens of medics, doctors and scientists have written to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to express their “grave concern” over the proposals.  In a joint letter, they warned it is irresponsible, unethical and unnecessary to jab children and urged the medicines watchdog not to repeat mistakes from history.Their intervention came as Matt Hancock announced that Britain had bought enough Pfizer vaccines to inoculate all children over the age of 12.The Health Secretary said the Government would be very, very careful and sensitive about whether to roll out the vaccination programme to children, but stressed that research showed the jabs were safe. He told MPs on Monday that a decision was likely to be taken within the next two months while the rollout continued through younger age groups.The letter, organised by Dr Ros Jones, a retired consultant paediatrician and member of Health Advisory and Recovery Team, warns the MHRA of the dangers of vaccines which are “rushed to market”.They said: “Extreme caution has been exercised over many aspects of the pandemic, but surely now is the most important time to exercise true caution.“We must not be the generation of adults that, through unnecessary haste and fear, risks the health of children.”The letter has been signed by over 40 medics, scientists and doctors including Prof Karol Sikora, dean of medicine at Buckingham University, and Lord Moonie, a former consultant in Public Health Medicine.It argues that while there are clear benefits of a vaccine for the elderly and vulnerable, the balance of benefit and risk for youngsters is “quite different” since healthy children are at “almost no risk” from Covid-19.The letter goes on to say that children do not need the vaccination to support herd immunity, adding that recent modelling suggests the UK has now achieved the herd immunity threshold.“All medical interventions carry a risk of harm, so we have a duty to act with caution and proportionality,” it says.“This is particularly the case when considering mass intervention in a healthy population, in which situation there must be firm evidence of benefits far greater than harms”.Ministers secured an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine last month, on top of the 40 million originally purchased, following a trial that showed 100 per cent efficacy among teenagers.The jabs may also be used for booster doses to tackle new variants, with all over-50s set to be offered a third dose later this year.Members of the JCVI have said there are a lot of ethical considerations to be made before a decision on vaccinating children is taken. An MHRA spokesperson said: “We will provide a response to the issues raised in the letter regarding Covid-19 vaccines in children following full consideration.We rigorously review clinical data in support of applications for any vaccine. A Covid-19 vaccine would only be authorised for younger age groups once the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis gaza peace palestinians israel has no long term strategy","story":"Many are still scrambling to understand how we got to this point in the Gaza conflict, to process the scope of violence and pinpoint the triggers that sparked it.But what is already painfully clear is that even when the current warfare subsides, the endgame will remain elusive and while civilians lose their lives, the fundamental problems will still remain and the conflict will only deepen.Israeli top political and military brass insist that the goal of the current offensive in Gaza is to achieve “long-term quiet,” as Benny Gantz, the defence minister, put it.For now, Israeli leaders appear to hope to reach that goal through the exclusive use of force. Israel has been staving off a cease fire because it says it needs time to carry out as many airstrikes as possible so as to set back Hamas’s capabilities and restore Israel’s deterrence.Four major confrontations in the past nine years suggest, however, the limits of such deterrence. Hamas, for its part, is a Palestinian Islamist group that has, since its establishment in 1987 used indiscriminate violence and force against civilians to try and make gains.Where does this leave us? No one in the Israeli leadership is articulating the goal of peace with the Palestinians, and hasn’t for quite some time.Instead, Israeli leaders appear to limit the goal to pushing back the next outbreak of violence for as long as possible, to have a period of long relative quiet until the next round of war.They implicitly take as a given that there will be a next war. The Israeli leadership calls what it is doing in Gaza now “mowing the grass,” knowing it will grow back before long.  Yet the events of recent days suggest that policymakers now seem unable to achieve even the lesser objective they espouse of long-term quiet not just in Gaza but also in occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and inside Israel proper.The past few days have seen rocket fire from Gaza at a massive scale, popular protests, as well as mob violence between Palestinian and Jewish citizens, all happening simultaneously.These undermine the notion that Israel can, at no cost to itself, continue to be an occupying power and, within its own borders, engage in systematic discrimination with the support of the international community. As it continues down this path, Israeli leaders appear to implicitly concede that while Israel may not achieve a decisive victory in Gaza, maintaining the status quo is preferable to any alternative, even if that entails a war every few years. What’s different this time around is that the war is no longer confined to fighting Hamas in Gaza.What has unfolded over the past week indicates that Israel’s strategy for achieving long-term quiet is not working -- not only with Hamas in Gaza, but on the “Palestinian question” overall.We are seeing the ultimate failure of Israeli might to control a people by fragmenting and repressing them. Since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the failure of the Oslo Accords, Israel’s chosen policy has been to manage the conflict rather than solve it.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has largely been able to bury the Palestinian issue, chiefly not through the explicit use of force, but through diplomatic and political channels and PR and media warfare (ie. the war on BDS, the movement to boycott goods made in Israeli settlements, and also on free speech) when possible.This approach reached its climax in the Trump presidency and the Abraham Accords, which sanctioned and normalised military occupation, the acquisition of land through force, and de facto annexation.Now, however, the Palestinians are rising up everywhere. Over recent weeks, the Israeli government has found itself exerting more explicit force on many fronts once again - not just the bombardment in Gaza, but by raiding the al-Aqsa mosque, repressing peaceful protests against forced expulsions in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, sending border police units into Palestinian communities inside Israel and threatening to deploy soldiers against its own citizens. The absence of an effective strategy is on full display.If Israel’s really wants a long term calm short of overall peace, it should seek to de-escalate tensions and address resolvable issues through political and diplomatic means.Israel could, for example, articulate a minimum demand that Hamas and other groups in Gaza end any and all indiscriminate rocket fire on Israel while agreeing on ways to phase out the blockade on Gaza and help get it out of its perpetual state of being on the brink of collapse, which is driving people further into despair.Israel can always fall back on military force if it must, but to the extent it can seek out alternative means to extract and grant concessions, maybe it could begin to carve a path out of the deadly cycle of violence.Mairav Zonszein is a senior analyst on IsraelPalestinian Territories with the International Crisis GroupMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"knee jerk lockdowns not answer","story":"Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that deaths from Covid currently make up less than two per cent of all weekly fatalities. Yet despite the retreat of the pandemic in the face of a remarkably successful vaccination programme, the fear of a Covid upsurge continues to dominate debate around public health almost to the exclusion of all other considerations.The Prime Minister, who had been confident until recently that the “road map” to normality was on track, is now hedging his bets. Arguably the pace of the unlocking was already too cautious given the rapid decline in hospitalisations and fatalities – supposedly the two key metrics for deciding on the next steps.Where is any cost-benefit analysis of keeping these restrictions in place? Governments may legitimately take draconian action in the midst of a rapidly accelerating epidemic but it is unacceptable to continue with these constraints when the impact of the virus is both low and localised. Those who say the measures are justified in order to limit the risk of future infections need to ask themselves when this would end.Contingency plans that had been drawn up for dealing with pandemics were largely abandoned when the coronavirus hit. Lockdowns spread around the world from China and then Italy as hospitals came under massive pressure in some areas. But no one had ever carried out an assessment of the effect lockdowns would have on society beyond the public health benefit occasioned by keeping people apart.Fear of being blamed is at the heart of this. Dominic Cummings, the former No 10 aide, is promising to make startling revelations about what was done in the early stages of the pandemic when he appears before a select committee next week. As Clement Attlee once said of Harold Laski, a period of silence on his part would be welcome.Even though the most vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Government’s concern appears to be the potential spread of a more virulent strain of Covid among the unvaccinated population, placing pressure once again on hospitals. But this should be addressed either by increasing capacity or developing triage procedures that allow people to be treated away from hospital.Moreover, why are the rules governing face coverings not being withdrawn? In America, where Covid rates are higher than here, Joe Biden has effectively bowed to the action already being taken by many US states and removed the requirement for vaccinated people to wear masks. Here, it is startling to see so few MPs in the Commons chamber, and for those who are there all to be masked, at a time when offices up and down the land are trying to get their employees to return to their desks. Vaccinated MPs who recently went into the chamber without a mask were upbraided by the Speaker who threatened to suspend the sitting. What example are our elected representatives setting? They are just projecting fear. If people want to carry on wearing masks, let them – but to insist that those who have been fully vaccinated must do so is perverse.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"netanyahu says hamas set back years gaza bombing","story":"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has claimed that the bombardment of Gaza has set Hamas back by many years amid reports that a ceasefire being brokered by Egypt could come into effect on Thursday morning.While visiting an airbase, Mr Netanyahu said Hamas has received blows it didn\u0027t expect as the Israeli military continued to launch airstrikes on Gaza and Hamas launched rockets towards  Israel overnight. Both Hamas and Israel deny that a deal on a ceasefire had been reached, though the left-wing newspaper Haaretz quoted an Israeli official as saying that an agreement would likely be reached by Thursday.The latest comments from Mr Netanyahu suggest that he is eager to present the fighting as a major victory to the Israeli public, in a potential sign that the conflict could be winding down.However, he has also repeatedly insisted that the fighting will go on for as long as necessary.   It came as Gaza medical officials said 217 Palestinians have been killed, including 63 children, and more than 1,400 have been wounded since the fighting began on May 10. Israeli authorities say 12 people have been killed in Israel, including two children.In a 25-minute attack overnight, 52 Israeli aircraft struck what Israel\u0027s military described as Hamas tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip. The IDF said 40 targets were hit in the operation.Nearly 450 buildings in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or badly damaged, including six hospitals and nine primary-care health centres, since this round of conflict began, the UN humanitarian agency said.Some 48,000 of the 52,000 displaced had gone to 58 UN-run schools.Israel said more than 3,450 rockets had been launched at it from Gaza, some falling short and others shot down by its Iron Dome air defences. It put the number of militants it has killed at about 160.Hamas began firing rockets nine days ago in retaliation for what it said were Israeli rights abuses against Palestinians in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.By taking the lead in confrontation with Israel over the sensitive issue of Jerusalem, Hamas also posed a challenge to its main rival, West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas, who last month cancelled a parliamentary election in which the group appeared likely to make gains.These hostilities are the most serious between the militant group and Israel in years, and in a departure from previous Gaza conflicts, have helped fuel street violence in Israeli cities between Jews and Arabs.France called on Tuesday for a UN Security Council resolution on the violence, but it was unclear whether the US would block it for the fourth time since violence began. Diplomats said the United States told the council a public pronouncement right now would not help calm the crisis.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"damning scale uk child poverty","story":"NewsDamning scale of UK child poverty exposed - search for figures in your area as North East worst hitMore than a third of children in the North East are living in poverty as the National Education Union urges MPs to back a pledge to eradicate child povertymirrorShareByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsVikki Waterman, , from Consett, Co Durham, with her two daughters Emmy, , and Eden, \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Some . million children across the UK were trapped in poverty before the Covid crisis in  , up , from the previous year – and up , since  . Research for the End Child Poverty coalition by Loughborough University shows more than a third of children in the North East have been pushed below the breadline , rising from % in just five years. Stagnating wages and freezes to in-work benefits have pushed the region from just below the UK average to the second highest after London, the report said.Campaigners are calling on ministers to hike child benefits and to scrap plans to cut the £ a week Universal Credit uplt in October.The National Education Union , which is part of the coalition, has joined forces with the Mirror to demand MPs back a pledge to eradicate child poverty and ensure no child is left behind.  Some  opposition MPs have signed the vow - but the grim figures will pile fresh pressure on Boris Johnson ’s Tories to act.Across the UK, % of children are growing up in poverty, with Wales worst hit , followed by Englandthen Scotland and Northern Ireland . A child is deemed to be living in povertytheir household falls below % of median income. For a family of two adults and two children, this amounts to £ a week - and for a single parent with one child it is £ a week. The stats calculate poverty levels after housing costs are taken into account to avoid skewing results for areas where rents are higher. Most of the top  constituencies with the sharpest rise in child poverty were in the North East. Middlesborough was worst hit, with child poverty soaring by .% over five years, with nearly halfof children living in hardship.  Newcastle upon Tyne Central saw deprivation rise by .% with .% of kids plunged in poverty. In Sedgefield, child poverty levels rose by .% to .%. Researchers said: “This pattern suggests that child poverty is growing at an alarming rate across the urban areas of the North East, whereas the greatest changes where are more localised. “This is likely to be influenced in particular by the presence in the region of a large proportion of low-paid workers who had only been just above the poverty line, and were pushed below by the freeze in their in-work benefits.” The highest rates of child poverty are in London and Birmingham - England’s two largest cities. London constituencies of Bethnal Green and Bow, and Hackney South and Shoreditch had the worst child poverty levels, with .% and .% of kids living in hardship. This was followed by Birmingham Ladywoodand Birmingham Hall Green .  Kevin Courtney and Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretaries of the National Education Union, said: “It’s just not right that child poverty is reaching these shocking levels throughout the UK – an average of  children in a class of  are trapped in poverty. “Heads, teachers and support staff believe the Government should be shocked enough to act.” Anna Feuchtwang, Chair of the End Child Poverty Coalition, said the situation for children “couldn’t be starker”. Shadow Child Poverty Secretary Wes Streeting, who grew up on a council estate, said: “Under the Conservatives, child poverty was rising before the pandemic. Now it’s set to rise even further. This is a total disgrace. “I’m proud to back the Mirror and the NEU’s campaign and urge Mirror readers to write to their MPs to help put pressure on the Government to act so that no child grows up experiencing hunger and homelessness.”  Jack Dromey, Birmingham Erdington MP, said: “It brings great shame on this country that in  not only should so many children still be living in poverty, but that there should continue to be increases in this number. It was with great pride that the last Labour Government worked so hard to reduce poverty figures, but since the Tories have been power child poverty levels have gone in the wrong direction.A Government spokesperson said: “Latest figures show that the number of children in absolute poverty has fallen by , since . “We are committed to supporting families most in need, spending billions more on welfare and planning a long-term route out of poverty by protecting jobs through furlough and helping people find new work through our Plan for Jobs. “We also introduced our £ million Covid Local Support Grant to help children and families stay warm and well-fed throughout the pandemic.” Struggles to make ends meet A single mum-of-two has described the battle to make ends meet despite working a full time job. Vikki Waterman, from Consett, Durham, said she often has to rely on £-a-week child benefit in the last two weeks of the month as housing and bills eat up her pay packet. Despite working  hours a week at a dental practice, she still struggles with providing for her two daughters Eden, , and Emmy, . And the pandemic has added further pressures, with her eldest daughter Eden forced to use her mum’s mobile phone to do her school work as they don’t have a laptop.  “It just astounds me that the Government doesn’t seem to understand the boundaries we face as working parents, particularly as single working parents,” she said. “It’s really frustrating to me that there’s this view that these people aren’t working. It’s not the case.” Vikki slammed the “benefits scrounger culture”, adding: “No one should be working full time and raising their children in poverty.” She said: “I feel like working families were at a disadvantage long before Covid in the North East. The rise of poverty levels is absolutely heartbreaking but they’re unsurprising to anyone who lives here. “We’ve had issues with Government cuts, particularly over the last decade and then when you put the pandemic on top of that, we’ve got nowhere to turn. “We’ve had no flexibility, no financial safety net. We’re living week to week, day to day.” Ministers need to look properly at the issues in the North East rather than dropping by for photos, she said. “Don’t just come and go to the brewery and the steelworks and things like that and look at industry. Come to the food bank, come to the baby bank.” Rising costs put families under pressure A hard-pressed mum spoke of the rising costs of family le which push parents into the poverty trap. Leanne Readman, , is looking for a job in the struggle to make ends meet. The pandemic - and home schooling - has added to the household bills due to the rising costs of heating, council tax, rent, food and clothing for children Olivia, , and Harley, four, with partner Peter Kennedy, .  He works hard in a food factory close to their home on the Thorntree estate in Middlesbrough, N. Yorks, one of the  most deprived neighbourhoods in England, according to Government child poverty data. Leanne knows that her chances of finding employment have been hit due to the impact of Covid-. So she looks to stretch her partner’s £-a-month wage as she faces rising monthly bills of £ for gas and electricity, £ council tax, £ rent, and £ for food. She said: “We recently moved house because Olivia needed her own space. “My mum lives opposite and Peter’s mum is next door so we have more support. “When we left our old address, we owed £ in gas and electricity. We pay that in instalments. “I can understand how people are struggling. I think that it is partly down to the pandemic.  “I now need to find a job because we cannot physically get what we need. The rent and council tax have gone up and all the bills added up when we were home schooling. “I will need to work around the kids because I cannot afford child care. That is the hardest part for us. As Peter is working we cannot get a voucher for child care, we have to pay for it.” Peer pressure means that there is the demand for top clothing brands for her children too. “We wait for trainers to go on sale, added Leanne, who worked in a school before becoming a full-time mum. “But there is still the pressure there to get designer goods like jackets. I wish that was all part of the school unorm. That needs to change. It can lead to bullying.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsMore OnConservative PartyBoris JohnsonWes StreetingpovertyPoliticsHomelessness"},{"url":null,"title":"local lockdowns would devastating solution","story":"NewsopinionLocal lockdowns would be devastating but the solution is staring us in the faceGreater ManchesterMayor Andy Burnham writes exclusively for the Mirror and warns Boris Johnsons government is in danger of not learning the lessons of mirrorShareCommentsByAndy Burnham:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionGreater ManchesterMayor Andy Burnham writes exclusively for the Mirror \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Aside from Leicester, we have had more experience of living with local lockdowns than anywhere  and we have real concerns that they simply do not work. We are in danger of not learning the lessons of . Local lockdowns can create a perverse incentive to travel for people in areas where cases are high. For instance, when hospitality was open throughout the Christmas period in some parts of the North West but not in others, people travelled to the areas where pubs and restaurants were open, potentially causing the virus to circulate. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  We also know that local lockdown restrictions are not strong enough to stop the spread of a highly-transmissible iant in its tracks. The Kent iant ripped through local lockdowns last Christmas leading to a national lockdown in the New Year. Last week we learnt that SAGE believes this Indian iant is more transmissible than even the Kent strain, maybe as much as % more transmissible. And behind the questionable health benefits, there is the certain economic harm of new local lockdowns in some of the places already hardest hit by this pandemic.  Accelerating vaccination in high-case areas will be much more effective than trying to halt the virus at the border of a city, a county or even an entire region. The trust of the public will be lostlocal lockdown restrictions are imposed on them just at the time when the Government is easing them everywhere . And it will be harder for mayors and local leaders to ask the public to observe local lockdowns when the Government hasn’t even tried other solutions that might have prevented them in the first place. For instance, why has the issue of self-isolation support for people in low-paid, insecure work never been properly addressed   Here in Greater Manchester, we have raised this issue repeatedly for over a year but it has never been fixed properly. Once again, public health leaders are telling us that is a major chink in our armour against the Indian iant. Alongside full income support to enable people to self-isolate, high case areas need to be given permission to vaccinate all people right down to the age of , together with vaccine supplies and wider support to do it.

It is very dficult to segregate amber list and red list passengers on a plane, train or ferry.Within an airport it is very dficult to segregate people, because of the physical proximity. That is why travelling is dangerous, why we tell people not to travel and why, when people do travel, we tell them to isolate. Travelling is dangerous, and that is not news to us or to the people who get on those planes in the first place. The ultimate sanction here is that, particularly as we go into the summer, we tell people: travelling is not for this year.

To tackle lockdown boredom, Laura encouraged the family to get creative on their kitchen project. Laura says: We moved in four years ago, but the previous occupants had been here since  and had never changed the kitchen - so it had been in for at least  years.  It was very dark, with just one small window and a black worktop and black floor. The units were brown and boring, which we felt didnapost reflect the personalities of Cameron and myself, as we like bright interiors and quirky design. After searching around for new fittings, Laura was disheartened to learn the kitchen of her dreams would cost an eye-watering £,. Adamant not to be defeated, Laura got creative and decided to embark on the project herself - calling on Cameron and the kids to get involved when she needed a helping hand.  However, she hit a bump in the road in May , when everyone  had the same idea to start their own DIY projects, and couldnapost get her hands on the paint she wanted. But savvy Laura had an idea. She said: We had some white garage floor paint left over. We didnapost like our black worktop and because the garage floor paint was heavy-duty and thick, I wonderedit would stick to it. It was a real budget job, as was the whole project really, using leftovers as much as possible. Luckily, Lauraaposs instincts were right.  Our worktop had a real shiny finish, it was like a marble effect, so I thought it might work and,it didnapost we decided to get a second-hand worktop. But it stuck really nicely. After giving the surfaces a new lease of le, Laura got to work on sorting out the kitchen floor, her biggest challenge.I painted the floor - it was like black slate tiles - and I painted them in white.Then I got a stencil with grey paint to give the pattern - having to do each tile one at a time, she said.But instead of complaining about the hard work, Laura claims it was therapeutic. She said: It felt like therapy and aposme timeapos and our kitchen looks so much bigger and brighter now.  Laura roped the kids in to do their bit too, asking them to sugar scrub down the kitchen cupboard doors. would say, aposCome on kids, get the sponge out,apos and they were always up for helping.Then we primed them with a really cheap undercoat from Wilko, and finally painted them blue.We replaced the door handles with some cheap ones off Amazon, but the new ones only needed one hole, so we had to do some filling and painting where the old ones had two.Once the cupboards, surfaces and the floor were taken care of, Laura repainted the walls which had got grubby over the years from kidsapos handprints. After just two weeks of gruelling DIY, Lauraaposs transformed kitchen was finished.  We had to get a move on, because it was very disruptive with the kitchen out of action. You donapost realise how much you go in and out of your kitchen until you canapost do it, she explained. Nearly a year on from the rebirth of her kitchen, Lauraaposs chuffed with how itaposs lasted. Itaposs all held up fine and everything still looks fab. You wouldnapost know what weaposd used, she gushed. We just werenapost in a position to spend huge amounts, so Iaposm really proud of the achievement. And when friends came over during that brief reopening in the middle of the lockdowns they were all really impressed, she added. Since revamping the kitchen, Laura is keen to spend as much time in there as possible. She said: Because Iaposm the main cook, I regard the kitchen as my room. It is now my happy place, and Iaposm happy to be in there.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAmazonArtDiyers"},{"url":null,"title":"ex primary school headteacher struck","story":"NewsEx-primary school headteacher struck off after drinking vodka and orange during breakJane Woolfenden, , has been banned from teaching in all schools in England after a  found she had \"failed to maintain high standards of behaviour\" when she drank vodka at workmirrorShareCommentsByStephen Topping:,  MAY NewsFormer headteacher Jane Woolfenden has been struck off after admitting she carried vodka with her to work \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jane Woolfenden, , admitted sneaking a bottle of vodka into her handbag from her car boot and bringing it inside Lyndhurst Community Primary School in Greater Manchester.She said she drank it with orange juice during a lunch break at the Dukinfield school after a colleague spotted the alcohol when she accidentally knocked over her bag, the Manchester Evening News reports. Mrs Woolfenden - who was said to be highly respected among her peers - has now been banned from teaching at all schools, sixth form colleges, youth accommodation and childrenaposs homes in England.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments section below. A Teaching Regulation Agency  which met on April  heard that Mrs Woolfenden was seen taking her handbag to her car at lunchtime on July , , and ed to school with the vodka in her bag. A whistleblower, who remained anonymous, said they accidentally knocked over Mrs Woolfendenaposs handbag and noticed what looked like a vodka bottle. Two witnesses told the  that the following day, Mrs Woolfenden admitted that she had brought vodka into school and had drank some. During a disciplinary interview alongside her trade union representative on July , Mrs Woolfenden said she had bought the vodka on the way home from work on July .  She said she kept the vodka in her handbag and moved it to her car boot on the morning of July  while attending a conference, before putting it back in her bag at lunchtime and drinking it with orange juice. The  ruled that by bringing vodka into the school and drinking it, Mrs Woolfenden had failed to maintain high standards of behaviour. A report published following the hearing said: The  was satisfied that the conduct of Mrs Woolfenden amounted to misconduct of a serious nature which fell signicantly short of the standards expected of the profession. The  considered that, as a teacher and headteacher of the school, Mrs Woolfenden had a responsibility to safeguard the pupils at the school and her actions and decisions could be impacted by her consumption of alcohol. The allegations as proven had the potential to tarnish both Mrs Woolfenden’s reputation and the school’s reputation. An anonymous whistleblower also claimed Mrs Woolfenden had tipped a glass of fizzy orange juice down the sink in the toilets on July , . No alcohol was found on the premises that day and Mrs Woolfenden denied the allegation, so the July  allegations were not proven. The  found that Mrs Woolfenden did have a previously good history and was handed a number of testimonials in support of her. They included accounts from two headteachers, with one describing her honesty, humanity, humility and strength of moral purpose for the school and the community she serves. Sarah Buxcey, who made the decision to ban Mrs Woolfenden from teaching on behalf of the Secretary of State, said a lack of insight or remorse which the  felt from the former headteacher meant there was some risk of the repetition of this behaviour. She added: In my view, it is necessary to impose a prohibition order in order to maintain public confidence in the profession. Mrs Woolfenden can apply for the ban to be reviewed from May , . Lyndhurst Community Primary School declined to comment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationSchoolsPublic servicesAlcohol"},{"url":null,"title":"inside algarve calm before storm","story":"NewsBrits book virtually every hotel room on Algarve to escape after year from hellEXCLUSIVE: Portugal is bracing itself for an invasion of British families this half-term - with virtually every hotel fully-booked.

Locals say it is “the calm before the storm”, with thousands of British families set to travel to Portugal after the overseas holiday ban was lted and the country was included on the travel “green list”. Tourism chiefs have been astonished by the “phenomenal” interest from Brits desperate to escape a soggy spring after a long lockdown. Some hotel chains said they have no availability for the first week of June when most schools are shut. Villa companies say demand has rocketed for half-term week. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Joao Fernandes, head of the Algarve tourist board, told the Mirror: “Many of the hotels are completely full, although not all. “So all I can say is people need to get booking as soon as possible. It’s been phenomenal. “The feedback I am getting from hotels is that it will be very busy with families from the UK. “We expect more bookings once people see images of tourists on the beaches and in the restaurants.”  Mr Fernandes said thousands of Brits travelled to the Algarve on Monday as foreign travel restrictions were lted. “The first day went very well indeed,” he said. “People were arriving with a smile on their face and swapping their winter clothes for shorts and bikinis.“They were welcomed by typical Algarve weather, in the s and the sun shining.“It was a refreshing day for everyone, including the locals who now feel there is a sense of ing to normal.”  Joao Paulo Sousa, vice president of Tourism Algarve, said hotel bookings had soared by % in recent days. “Since the English authorities announced the release of reservations, business in Portugal has been booming,” he said. “Bookings for hotels increased by % on Friday and outside of tour operators, the bookings were up %. “So many British companies are providing more flights to the Algarve. “There are , more seats now with EasyJet and , new available seats overall. “So everything is really booming with the British people coming back again.”  Geoff Bacon, owner of Almancil-based Golf and Leisure Villas, said demand had sky-rocketed in the past few days. The -year-old, originally from Chingford, Essex, told the Mirror: “The golf bookings have gone bosh, through the roof. “The villas are also pretty scarce now, especially for half-term and more so for the summer. “As you can imagine lots of villa owners are coming out after being stuck in the UK for so long. “But we are getting calls and emails from families eager to see some sunshine during half-term.  “The golf side of the business has been dead for the past  months but now it’s bonkers again. “It’s a great relief for us to be busy again and it’s nice to know so many Brits are coming back.” Brits continued to flock to the Algarve’s beaches and pools on Tuesday as they enjoyed their well-earned holidays. Jan Johnson, , from Swansea, flew with her extended family after spending lockdown caring for her elderly mum. She is also celebrating getting the all-clear from doctors after a gruelling battle with breast cancer.  “My mum had a stroke so I’m her full-time carer. I was doing -hour weeks just looking after her during lockdown,” she said. “I was also going through the whole cancer thing at the same time, so I’m not going to lie, it’s been tough. “I just needed a break so I paid for my mum to have full-time care for a week and booked the holiday. “I’ve had both jabs so I wasn’t nervous coming out here.

They were joined on the sand by Jamelah May, , who came on holiday after a “year from hell” that saw her beauty business collapse. Sitting on Vilamoura beach with daughter Mylee, , she said: “It feels like I’m putting all the worries of lockdown behind me. “I had a tanning salon in Feltham which went bust because of the lockdown. “We were accumulating debt because we couldn’t open and it turned into a vicious cycle.” Jamelah, from Esher, Surrey, added: “It’s been an awful year so when I saw the chance to come to Portugal I jumped at it.  “I’m training in aesthetics and the course starts in June, so this is the only chance to get away. “I think everyone in the UK is thinking the same thing - they just want to go on holiday.” Chris Watton brought his recruitment team out to Vilamoura as “thank you” for working flat out during the pandemic. His UK firm has been involved in a global search for highly trained specialists to develop the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. And he treated his team, Jake Mann, , Frankie Thompson , and her partner Adam Hopkins, , to a much-needed break.  “We have all been working non-stop for the last year and this is a reward for us” said Chris, . “We all feel the work we have done has definitely made a dference.” The Sussex-based group made the “hassle-free” trip from Heathrow on Tuesday. “We are all sitting here outside, having a beer in the sunshine. So would I recommend people to come  % yes,” he said. Harry Khan, , from Sale, Greater Manchester, flew out to Faro with seven pals for a five day golf break in Vilamoura on Monday.  It is his first trip abroad since he was struck down by Covid during the first wave of the pandemic in March last year. Harry was treated for a week in Wythenshawe Hospital and at one point it was feared he would have to go into intensive care. But the super-fit father of four, who has played football all his le, was able to battle back from the brink. “If I had not been so fit and healthy I don’t know what would have happened” he said. Harry is well on the road to recovery but he said: “It knocked me for six. “It has taken me a long time to get over it. It was my lungs that were the problem.”  So when he had the opportunity to travel to Portugal, he jumped at it. “You only live once” he smiled. “When the chance came I went for it. We took a bit of a chance in booking before it was officially open but I’m so glad we did.” Lying on his sun-bed next to the hotel pool, clutching an ice cold beer, he said: “Look at the dference. “Two and a half hours after leaving Manchester we were here enjoying the sun. It’s a dferent world. “I’ve told my we I’m on a sales course in Skegness!” Harry said other Brits playing a break need to be aware of the number of tests which tourists have to take before, during and after their holiday. A PCR test is required before leaving the UK, another test needs to be done in Portugal and a third within two days of ing to the UK. “It is expensive, particularlyyou are talking about a family,” said Harry. “People do need to be aware of what is expected.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEasyJetHalf TermHoliday cottages and villasBikinisHolidaysCoronavirus lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing.

I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.

There has been fears that mass events such as concerts and sporting matches could cause big Covid outbreaks.But as long as there are screenings and good ventilation alongside other factors that help to mitigate the risk, the spreading of coronavirus can massively decrease, as initial data from the events research programme suggests.The discovery has brought back hope that the June  lting of all restrictions will be able to go ahead as planned. Thereaposs been concerns this date will have to be pushed back due to the spread of the Indian Covid iant.  But the new findings may make more of a case for mass events to have Covid-status certication, proving people going have a low risk of being infectious and spreading the virus. Ministers will get the results of the study in the coming days ahead of a decision being made about next monthaposs re-opening of everything. This said, plans for a new Covid ‘tier’ system have reportedly been drawn up by the government as fears mount over the Indian iant. Ministers are looking at a comeback for isive local lockdowns in England as areas like Bolton and Bedford battle the B... strain. According to The Times and Politico, there are three options for what happens on June , when it had been hoped all legal restrictions would end. Either it will go ahead as planned, or there will be local restrictions in some areas, or some June  easings will be delayed for the whole country.  While this research into the safety of big events took place before the developing concerns about the Indian iant, it is still likely to play a big part in the governmentaposs decision-making.A government source told The Times : “We are still waiting for the final bits of data but the results so far have been very encouraging.“It will help make the case that these large events are not inherently more risky than other parts of the hospitality sector. It shows that there are things that you can do to make these settings as safe as other daily activities. The source added that while the mass events arenapost  per cent safe, you can decrease the risk to a reasonable level. These big events will take a lot more organisation than they would have done before the pandemic, with requirements for those attending and participating to prove theyaposve had a negative Covid test recently, reducing the capacity inside the venue and strict organisation with entering and moving around the venue to minimise any mixing.  But initial results from test events, including the Brit Awards, the World Snooker Championship, and a business conference and nightclub event in Liverpool, suggest that as long as these extra measures are employed, the risk of an outbreak is low. The pilot also included three matches at Wembley in London to test out crowd management. Both indoor and outdoor events were tested. No-one had to wear masks and there was no need for the one metre social distancing rule. While many of the events were seated, there was a club night where crowds were mixing on the dance floor. People in attendance at these test events wore a device that monitored how many other people they came into contact with and what they did in those scenarios , including how far apart they stayed. The government was warned by behaviour experts thatthese pilot events led to fresh coronavirus outbreaks then confidence in them would plummet. Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister, is leading the review into a need for Covid-status certication. Itaposs expected to come out before June .Current plans suggest a negative test, a vaccine or antibody status would be needed for anyone to go to parts of the economy like nightclubs, sports events or concerts.

India was placed on the red list following the emergence of the iant which is believed to be far more transmissible than the Kent strain. Flights are also permitted from neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh, which are also red listed - meaning people arriving from these countries must quarantine in a hotel for  days.  This is despite direct flights being banned from other countries where new iants emerged, including Brazil and South Africa. Fears have been voiced over travellers being packed together at airports, meaning those arriving from India are mixing with passengers travelling to and from other parts of the world.Last night the Mirror exclusively revealed that three planes potentially packed with passengers touched down at Heathrow Airport from Mumbai and Delhi early this morning –  days after India was slapped on the red list.Only British and Irish citizens, or those with residence rights in the UK – including long-term visa holders – are allowed into England having travelled from or transited through India.  That rule came into force at am on April .NHS Test and Trace figures show that in the two weeks from April  – one day before the ban came into effect – to May , some , people who arrived in England from India were tested for coronavirus.Given that everyone is meant to be tested, the figure should be the same as the number of passengers. Anxious travellers have said they were worried about catching Covid at airports after being mixed in with people from red list countries.  One said yesterday : I arrived back in the country from South Africa - one of the red listed countries. I was more terried catching Covid while going through border control than walking around South Africa.While queuing there was no social distancing we had a plane from India arrive straight after ours and we queued for over three hours and when their plane arrived it was out the door. A Department for Transport spokeswoman told the Mirror: “We have adapted and bolstered our world leading test and quarantine systems for incoming passengers since the start of the pandemic, and will continue to closely monitor direct flights from a small number of Red List countries to seea blanket ban would be necessary and proportionate. “Public safety always comes first, however we need to also consider other factors, such as critical freight and helping British nationalshome safely.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHeathrow AirportDepartment for TransportCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"mum 23 diagnosed tumour days","story":"NewsMum, , diagnosed with tumour days after giving birth dies weeks after dream weddingMegan Sweeney was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour only two days after she gave birth to her son, Roan, in August , and has now tragically passed away less than a month after marrying the love of her lemirrorShareCommentsBySarah VestyLucy SkouldingFreelance writer:,  MAY NewsMegan Sweeney got married in April but tragically died in May \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryRoyal FamilyPrince WilliamPrincess DianaMeghan Markle"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harrys contradictions thick fast","story":"NewsopinionPrince Harrys contradictions are coming thick and fast - does he know family can hear him The trailer for Prince Harrys latest post-royal project, a mental health programme with Oprah Winfrey, features the heartbreaking footage of him walking behind his mums coffin as a childmirrorShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-harry-stars-you-cant-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MWIueMF,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe seering image of Prince Harry, pain etched across his youthful face as he walked behind his mother’s coffin, is long ingrained in the memory. His tortured relationship with the role he was born into, from the bemused little boy who attended his first day at school in front of the press, to the lovable rogue who was happy to muck about for the cameras, has seen him face many struggles throughout the years. To many, it came as no surprise that he wanted out from The Firm. He’d long spoken to trusted friends about how he dreamed of walking away, perhaps not quite in the manner in which he eventually did so which continues to cause so much anguish for his family.  Over the last few months the wantaway Prince has taken to airing a series of grievances to favoured journalists and chat show hosts, while seemingly unaware his family can still hear him. Now the contradictions appear to be flowing thick and fast. Just days after comparing his le to The Truman Show film or akin to living in a zoo, he’s prepared to use his mother’s legacy to further his personal profile on the global stage. Quite how his family will feel, who he’s still not managed to secure a channel of communication with yet, only time will tell. Perhaps, some may argue, he is quite entitled to use his experiences to further his mental health crusade, as well as his new found profession as a film producer - Netflix have paid him a £million for the privilege after all. But purely examining his willingness to use his opening line to Oprah on the damage caused by derogatory mental health terms, while in the same breath this week labelling his adopted country’s First Amendment, the right to free speech, as “bonkers”, Harry may find the path to righteousness can be a bumpy one.

A YouGov poll carried out on Monday found  per cent of , adults questioned thought the couple should no longer be a duke and duchess. While  per cent believed they should keep their titles but not use them,  per cent said they should not lose their titles or stop using them and  per cent did not know.

Harry and Meghan married during a glittering ceremony on May   and are likely to mark their milestone privately at their Calornian home. But just  months after exchanging their vows the Sussexes travelled to North America with their son Archie and have never permanently ed to their UK home. The past few months have been a tumultuous period for the couple following their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. Meghan and Harry laid bare their brief le as a working royal couple, alleging a member of the family made a racist comment about their son, and explained the duchess had suicidal thoughts but her approaches to the monarchy for help were turned down.  The Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral in April briefly brought Harry back into the fold, and he was pictured moments after the ceremony looking at ease and chatting with his brother the Duke of Cambridge. A few days after their wedding anniversary Harry and Meghan, who is expecting a daughter in the summer, will appear in the first episode of the dukeaposs mental health documentary series with Oprah Winfrey. In the Apple TV+ series that begins on Friday, Harry says in conversation with Winfrey: To make that decision to receive help is not a sign of weakness. In todayaposs world, more than ever, it is a sign of strength. Footage of a young Harry during the funeral procession for his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, featured in a trailer for The Me You Canapost See.In a separate interview Harry appeared to suggest that his father and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had failed as parents.

Sunbathers who try to access areas when a red light is showing will also be fined. There is also a ban on kickabouts and other sporting activities involving two or more people on beaches when they are busy. The rules have been published on Tuesday in Portugal’s official gazette Diario da Republica and also apply to open air swimming pools.  The use of face coverings becomes mandatory when social distancing cannot be guaranteed in the bathing season, which begins officially on May  but has already started in parts of the Algarve such as Albufeira and Lagoa. The traffic light system will categorise beaches as green up to  per cent occupation and amber between  and  per cent.

Tourism chiefs on the Algarve, which welcomed . million British tourists a year before the coronavirus pandemic, are reporting “phenomenal” interest from UK families in the run-up to half-term in the first week of June.  Portugal is the only major European destination to make the UK’s green list and the Algarve Tourist Board says bookings have soared by  per cent in recent days. Most hotels on the Algrave are already booked up for the half-term holidays while tourism chiefs have been astonished by the “phenomenal” interest from Brits desperate to escape a soggy spring after a long lockdown. Joao Fernandes, head of the Algarve tourist board, told the Mirror: “Many of the hotels are completely full, although not all. “So all I can say is people need to get booking as soon as possible. It’s been phenomenal. “The feedback I am getting from hotels is that it will be very busy with families from the UK. “We expect more bookings once people see images of tourists on the beaches and in the restaurants.” British tourists are also flying to Gibraltar, which made the list after vaccinating virtually all its adult population and bringing its active Covid cases for residents and visitors down to zero for the first time since last July. Neighbouring Spain, on the UK amber list which means ing tourists have to self-isolate for  days, is still banning British holidaymakers from entering.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHalf TermSwimming poolsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"we can finally meet up","story":"NewsopinionWe can finally meet up indoors again - so the weather has made its displeasure knownOn Monday we could meet indoors again as Covid lockdown was eased, so the weather made its displeasure known and it lashed it down with rain, says Polly HudsonmirrorShareCommentsByPolly Hudson:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionBritish weather is predictably unpredictable with rain late into May \"Join the lockdown community for surveys on your viewsInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The weather’s gone mad with power. Always a force to reckon with – able to ruin celebrations, spoil fun, mess up plans – but lately anyone attempting to socialise outside has been completely at its mercy, and it’s been merciless. Its ego has spiralled out of control.On Monday, we were finally allowed to mix inside again, and it didn’t like that one bit. Its reign of terror was over, so it fought back, with a rain of terror.It threw an almighty tantrum, determined to prove that it was still the boss of us. Yes, we might be able to go to the pub now, but we’d be drenched when we got there, with frizzy hair. The only reliable thing about the British weather is that it’s unreliable. Every year, all year, the only thing we can count on is that we can’t count on it. And yet, despite its utter predictability, we are constantly astonished by it. I tried to outsmart it when I got married, smugly planning a cosy winter wedding rather than praying desperately for sunny blue skies and being crushed on the day. It snowed of course.So badly that many of our guests couldn’t travel, and the cake was held hostage by a vehicle whose doors had frozen shut. The weather always wins, see. But although the forecast is undeniably bleak, is this actually something to be glad about  Us Brits are never happier than when talking about the weather. We’ve had so much ­practice, we’re really good at it. On Monday, everywhere I went, everyone I came into any kind of contact with, only had one subject they eagerly wanted to discuss – the fact that it was raining. Again. The joy on their faces as they complained bitterly was ­unmistakable. The weather is something we all have in common. It’s impossible to get into an argument about whether it’s raining or not, and so far nobody has been cancelled for saying, “fingers crossed, it stops soon.” And even the most provocative keyboard warrior wouldn’t be silly enough to announce that they hope the sun comes out because, of course, that’s his choice to make, when andhe’s ready.The weather also brings out the optimist in all of us – like the part of the man I married in a room with loads of empty seats and no cake, who always believes next season might be dferent for Arsenal. Yes, it’s grey and rainy today but, who knows, maybe tomorrow the sun will shine. Probably not, admittedly, but there’s always a chance. Andit does, we’ll all have a spring in our step, a smile on our faces, and a complaint about being far too hot ready for the next person we meet.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusWeddingsCoronavirus lockdownWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"mystery sea beast angel wings","story":"NewsMystery sea beast with angel wings baffles locals as it washes up on beachKenny Harris, , encountered the gargoyle-like creature while visiting a US beach at North Carolinas Outer BanksmirrorShareCommentsByMichael HavisLucy SkouldingFreelance writer:,  MAY NewsThe strange creature was found on a beach in the US \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Kenny Harris, , encountered the gargoyle-like creature while visiting North Carolinaaposs Outer Banks with his family. He said: I went out for a morning walk alone and from a distance I saw something in the sand. As I got closer I saw this dead fish that looked like some scary creature. I thought it had wings - it looked like a gargoyle! Iaposm from West Virginia and I visit the Outer Banks twice a year, and I have never seen something like this before.  When he shared his photos online, many locals were just as stumped as him. Some said the creature was a mythical chupacabra, others suggested a bat-fish hybrid while several people noted the resemblance to Falkor - the dragon from the  film, The NeverEnding Story. I have fished down there for years and Iaposve never seen anything like it, one person commented.Itaposs the result of toxic waste constantly being dumped into our oceans,another said.One more wrote: It looks like a dementor from Harry Potter!  Eventually, however, a consensus emerged - Kenny had found an angelshark, a group of sharks classied as critically endangered. It was really freaky, said Kenny. Angelsharks were once common across the north Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. But a market for the fish developed in the s and the population dramatically declined. The specic type of angelshark Kenny encountered may be a Squatina dumeril, also known as the sand devil. However, due to insufficient data, itaposs unclear exactly how endangered the sand devil is. The species spends much of its time buried in the sediment on the ocean floor, lying in wait for its prey, including croakers, goatfishes and butterfishes. Though not normally aggressive, it can inflict serious woundsprovoked and has a reputation for snapping at fishermen when caught. How this particular shark died remains a mystery.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRare animalsAnimalsSharks"},{"url":null,"title":"couple chained together save relationship","story":"NewsCouple chained together to save relationship vow to remain chained until they get marriedViktoria Pustovitova and Alexander Kudlay have vowed to keep their steel love shackles on until their wedding day, despite the fact theyre not even engaged yetmirrorShareCommentsByEmma Rosemurgey:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video couple-chain-themselves-together--,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CrmntMWd,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

In the video exposing her teacher, Richelle can be seen lip-syncing to a woman saying: I think Iaposm uncomfortable. I think I might like to try to unalive myselfwe do this. The text over the video reads: Me after one of my high school teachers subscribed to my OnlyFans and told me they always knew I was something special. The video has since received a wave of online support, with over k plays on TikTok and over k likes, and countless comments of advice.  One alarmed TikTok user wrote: Iaposm sorry this is so disturbing. A second wrote: You should tell the school. And a third agreed, saying: I know he hasnapost broken any lawsbut seriously tell the school. They should be made aware that he could potentially be looking at high school girls like this. They should at least keep an eye on this guy.  Although Rara hasnapost shared any more details about her old teacher, orshe replied to him, but she has previously said on Youtube that she graduated back in  and was glad to leave her f****** abomination of a high school.

After being scouted, Rara said: I had been working out and training the hardest I have ever trained in my le. I was in tip-top, unbelievable shape. I was feeling really confident.But she was quick to regret signing a two-year contract with the company. She continued: I was told by the boutique agency that I was too muscular and that I really needed to lose the muscle and be really skinny. I had been working out like crazy and I looked so good. I had started really counting my calories to the point where it was so toxic and unhealthy because I was counting literally every single calorie on this app on my phone. After she hit breaking point with the modelling agency, and left one of her shoots early, the agency decided to drop her - and it seems to have worked out for the best.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A man and his fiancé decided to adopt a cat and went to visit a rescue centre together, and found one white cat that had been passed over many times. The man, who remains anonymous, said the reason why was obvious - because in its white fur was a black penis, going from the tip of its nose to up above its eyes. But the pair loved the cat all the same and decided take him home, and named him Richard, or Dick for short, but some of their friends think the choice of name was insensitive of the aposcataposs feelingsapos. Sharing the story on Reddit, the man wrote: Four months ago, my fiancé and I were looking to adopt a cat. We found a middle-aged cat that was sitting in a shelter for a long while for a very obvious reason.The black and white pattern of the coat created a painfully obvious penis shape right in the middle of the cats face - not gonna lie, I found this pretty funny and so did my fiancé. So we went out to meet the cat. He was super sweet so we took him home but the shelter said they didnapost know his name and that we can give him our own. Seeing how the thought of this cat having a penis face would be the first thing to anyoneaposs mind the moment they saw him, we thought it would be a funny little icebreaker to name him Richard. My own father, whose name is Richard, found this pretty funny and harmless, as did many other guests - until my sister in law visited.  She said it was completely inappropriate and aposa disservice to the cat and the cataposs feelings, since I made fun of him with this name, unbeknownst to the cat himselfapos and that It can be categorized as un-physical animal abuseapos. I told her the cat doesnapost even speak English so his feelings arenapost hurt at all, so I donapost see the problem here. She then got mad at my fiancé because heaposs aposenabling me to abuse an animal who canapost control what coat pattern it hasapos so now she has ghosted us.  What would you have named the cat  Let us know in the commentsAfter sharing the story online, the internet rallied around the man and said he wasnapost in the wrong for the name. One user said: Iaposm laughing so hard right now. This is great. Iaposm glad your sister in law ghosted you because she is out of her mindshe really believes any of the sewage leaking from her mouth. Another added: Unphysical animal abuse  What woke nonsense is your sister in law a victim of  And another added: The cat had been sitting in the shelter because of the penis shape on his face. Not only did you adopt him, you celebrated it with his new name. You’re not being mean to him, you’re turning what was an unfortunate circumstance into laughter and love. But also the cat doesn’t care. It’s a cat lol.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But once the initial irritation is over, you hopefully move on and it only pains you occasionally. One woman has had to teach herself to see the funny side of a larger mistake after she admitted she missed out on thousands of dollars. Itaposs fair to say it might be something that stays with her for a long time. Jules Schreiner posted an account of TikTok, where she explained exactly what happened.  The TikTok user said she advertised a couch for  on Facebook Marketplaceafter someone gave it to her for free. But it might have been an expensive mistake to not do any research beforehand.Jules said the sofa was bought within seconds and she later saw the new owner post it on Instagram, where they posted about the brand. After finally researching it, she claims the sofa was designed by Vladimir Kagan, an icon of mid-century modern American furniture design. In the video, she shared a photo of another sofa on sale for thousands of dollars - and explained that her sofa was by the same designer but in a dferent style. In the caption, Jules added: Thought I had got a great deal on FB market place but ya know things are always too good to be true. Her video racked up thousands of views, as people shared her pain. One commented: My mum used to work for a high-end brand, I didnapost know about when I searched it up I was like no way. Jules agreed, writing: Crazy a couch could be that expensive lol. Another commented: Ok so from now on, we are going to look for name brands on the things we buy ok  LOL then we are going to google them.A third advised:Google Lens is your best friendyouaposre flipping.Itaposs only worth that muchsomeone is willing to pay. I think you made out just fine getting  for a discoloured old couch, added one person. Another agreed, adding: In fairness, you won from this. The person got rid of their couch for free, you made  and the last guy got a bargain.

They stumbled across the piece of paper with hieroglyphic-looking markings while trying to find their cat. In a subsequent video, it was revealed that the piece of paper was covering a hole that lead under their bathtub. US TikToker Angelica explained that she and her boyfriend had recently got a new kitten and it had hidden somewhere in the couple’s home. While looking for their new pet, the couple discovered that there was a hole underneath one of their kitchen cabinets. It was there that they found the piece of paper with the drawings.  Since originally uploading the video, it has been viewed over . million times. When the couple explored behind the hole which the symbols covered, all they found an old fizzy drink cup and some cardboard. But just to be sure that the cryptic messaging wasnapost going to haunt their house, they burnt the piece of paper.  Several people on TikTok claimed to have deciphered the images on the note, which they say may mean that the area is cursed. Others, however, claimed that the images looked more innocent. One wrote: Probably a kid’s drawing covering up a hole they made.  Another user suggested a non-supernatural explanation for the hole in the wall, explaining: I don’t know what the paper means, that’s weird, but it looks like just a plumbing access to the tub. Some users, however, felt that the couple found evidence of something supernatural. One joked: The paper was meant to protect you! It was sealing away the bad omens!

In one of those seasons you get used to not winning many games.“Back then I felt the pressure on myself and I think the other boys did as well. We did see it through back then but it’s a tough job.#On Dundee#s hopes of promotion, he added: “We’ve given ourselves a chancebut we need to keep at it. We have got to the final but there’s no job done yet.“Anything can happen in a final.“Kilmarnock are not in that league for no reason, they are a good team with a good manager.#We know it will be tough but we also knowwe turn up and play the way we can then we have a right chance.”That - win over the Bairns was Ashcroft’s final match for Kilmarnock as he dropped down to the Championship anyway, signing for Dunfermline.There he spent four seasons before joining the Dark Blues last summer.And he has enjoyed a stellar first season at Dens Park, scoring six times – some of his goals vital in the second half of the season.Towering performances in both boxes were awarded with Player’s Player of the Year and Fan’s Player of the Year awards.However, he’s not finished yet and sees these next two matches as his route back to the Premiership, evenit is at the expense of his old team.“I have probably been in the Championship a bit longer than I wanted to be,” he added.“That’s down to myself as well so I’m delighted to have a real chance now.

performances against the Netherlands can be the springboard for both him and Scotland to shine on the world stage.The Saltires play their first fixture since December  today against the Dutch in Rotterdam.The One-Day Internationals today and on Friday mark the start of the Scotland’s build-up to the T World Cup in India in October.It’s been a long wait for the Scots toto international action and for Leask it’s been even longer, with his last appearance in coming in October .Having played in the  T World Cup and the  -over World Cup, the Aberdonian is determined to force his way into the side for this year’s tournament.The -year-old all-rounder said: “It’s not just having a taste of World Cups, it’s wanting to do well in them as well.“I’ve been to two World Cups and I haven’t done brilliantly.“So to go to them now and put my name out there by doing well would be great.“The last couple of qualiers haven’t gone the way I had wanted them to inidually, but from a team perspective we’ve done what we had to do and made the World Cup.“From a selfish perspective, it’s now about putting in performances when I get the chance.“That chance will hopefully be in Holland to start with and then go on from there.”Despite ious lockdowns and a lack of competitive cricket, Leask has still been working hard to improve.The former Stoneywood-Dyce player’s chief focus has been on his off-spin bowling as he looks to contribute with both bat and ball.He added: “You need all-rounders in teams, but it’s about both skills being up to scratch, which has been the problem.“I think in the past one skill has been outshining the other.“So, for me, it’s about putting both skills together, because I know I’m a good athlete in the field.“It’s just about combining the bat and the ball to give a more all-round performance, rather than only one of them being OK.“Putting the two together is the biggest thing for me.“The bowling side of things has been more dficult, but that’s what the hard work has gone into over the last  months.“HopefullyI get an opportunity in Holland that will come through.”After so long without a competitive outing because of the pandemic, Leask says everyone in Shane Burger’s squad is excited ahead of this week’s fixtures.He said: “It’s good to be back in among the guys and there’s a lot of hard work to be done to put in performances on the park and show the hard work that’s been done off the park.“That’s still to be seen, but there’s been lots of work done behind the scenes, so hopefully that proves to be fruitful.“It’s not been an easy  months for the squad, because we’ve not had any cricket, but everyone is raring to go.“The thing at the moment is that we’ve got  guys-plus fighting for  or  spots, which is exciting.“I think it’s good to have guys competing for spots, you want to have that and it makes for better training because the sessions are more competitive.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There is usually a palpable tension in the air.But there was none of that at this count. Carried out in a dferent way during daytime, physically spread out, limited attendees, socially distanced and cordoned off behind plastic.Everyone behind the planning of the election in Argyll and Bute deserves a huge pat on the back.

Two other events earmarked for funding, Inveraray Highland Games and Tiree Music Festival, have already been cancelled altogether.Applications for the latest phase of the fund closed in December , with a decision having been delayed by the policy and resources committee in February due to the continuing uncertainty over gatherings.In a report, executive director Kirsty Flanagan said: #Whilst there is still uncertainty and unpredictability it is hoped that events will be able to go ahead at some point later in the year.#It is therefore felt important to support our events industry as much as we can by awarding grants to those strategic events that hopefully still have a chance of going ahead either because of their nature or the fact that they are due to be held later in the year.#Members are therefore being asked to award in principle eight SEF grants currently totalling £,.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The content creator has a weighty , followers on Instagram, many of whom were gained over the last year alone. ldquoMy following grew massively during the pandemic, she explains, ldquowhereas it hadnrsquot grown that much in the last couple of years.One of the main reasons for this influx is Spiersrsquos dreamy, aesthetically pleasing interiors.ldquoI would think my niche, or my USP, is probably that I live quite a simple le ndash I view my content as being attainable but slightly aspirational.ldquoMy husband and I live in a three-bedroom tenement flat in the southside of Glasgow ndash itrsquos far from a mansion, but it has period detailing and wersquove done a lot of work to make it our own and inject our personality into it.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade. Bold colours never go out of style.www.katelavie"},{"url":null,"title":"10-best-museums-galleries-edinburgh-glasgow","story":"Kelvingrove Art Gallery And Museum, Kelvingrove, GlasgowOne of the gems in Glasgowrsquos art crown, Kelvingrove re-opens on Monday giving punters the chance to enjoy its world-beating collection.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The one on the shore has been there for more than a year, but the caravan on the high road has been left there as no-one overlooks that spot.#A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #We remove anything on council property andany of the areas identied are private land it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier to act.#We will make sure they are notied, work with them to have items removed and do what we can to identy the offender.#The fixed penalty notice for fly tipping is £.

The land to the west is within the settlement boundary but has no housing allocation.#It is therefore not deemed there will be neighbouring amenity issues regarding the proposal.#The northerly elevation will have gable height glazing to the living room and the mezzanine void space. The bedroom en-suite and office is served by rooflights.#There will be a porch to the west for utility reasons which will have a sloping roof to the eaves. The main roof is to be traditional slate with the walls re-using the stone. There is a single door on the easterly elevation and a chimney for the stove on that roof elevation.#A condition will be attached to any approval regarding the materials to be used. The design maintains the vernacular of the former byre and is deemed to be sympathetic to the main house and its setting as a listed building.#The officer added: #According to Scottish Water, there is no public waste water infrastructure within the vicinity of this proposed development and therefore advise the applicant to investigate private treatment options. The proposal can be fed from the Port Charlotte water works.#The council#s roads department highlights that the use of the existing private access to main road is acceptable.#The proposal is deemed to be an acceptable repurposing of an appropriate vacant building within an existing community and using existing infrastructure. It is also consistent with the council#s aim to reverse static or falling populations in a smaller rural community.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days. A Redfusion spokesman said that, apart from Scotland#s cities, Campbeltown was, as far as he knew, the first rural area to be offered colour television.A buffet lunch attended by Redfusion officials and Campbeltown town councillors will be held to launch the service.Angus has hit first best-sellerSalt In My Porridge, Angus MacVicar#s book about his family le in Southend and abroad, is now in its third edition and still selling well in local book shops and all over the country.Angus said: #This is my st book and the only one so far that can really be described as a best-seller. I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"new inspector looks learns and loves argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I#m taking everything and everyone at face value.#Though fresh to the job and area,  Inspector Collins won#t be charging in with his new broom.#I#m wary of coming in and trying to revolutionise everything,# he said.#There#s no way I know more than the folk who have worked here for #X# amount of years.#But that#s not to say that I won#t have ideas and plans going forward. Any plans I do have, though, will need to be linked to what I#m hearing from local people, both residents and police officers.#As he looks, listens and learns, he emphasised the importance of the bond between the police and local communities.#That working partnership is important,# he said. #They need us, but we need the community as well.#I come from a community policing background, and I do care about what I do # in a tight community people will soon knowI don#t care.#I want our officers to be out there and visible, and in order for me to fix things I need the community to tell me what the problems are.#Coming into the job during a pandemic, Inspector Collins sees the police role as supporting people as lockdown restrictions begin to ease.#As traffic begins to pick up and there are more people around I believe we should be there to look after people in the community and help them to adjust to lots of folk coming in.#For visitors, we need to adopt an education stance because those leaving litter behind, lighting fires and the rest of it are often doing it from a standpoint of ignorance.#I want people to come and visit Argyll and enjoy it, but more importantly the people who live here have to be foremost in everything we do.#The geography of Argyll is on a dferent scale to that seen in Lanarkshire, and the inspector admitted he was adjusting to this aspect of rural policing. With fewer police stations and big areas to cover, he says that partnership is key.#I#d love to be able to click my fingers and open more police offices, but that#s not the world we live in. It#s about working smarter and in partnership with others.#He continued: #I#ve spent some time getting out and about and I#m still getting used to the size of the area, but it#s gorgeous.#Though still travelling back to Hamilton at weekends to his we and two-year-old daughter, the plan is to move the whole family to Argyll in time.Inspector Collins concluded: #I#m looking forward to getting my we and daughter across here, because I think they#ll fall in love with Argyll just as I have.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know the new play equipment will make a real dference for local children and families in Campbeltown and we hope to see the fundraising campaign reach its target as soon as possible.#Councillor Kelly added: #I am delighted to have been able to secure this fantastic donation from ScottishPower Renewables and I would like to thank Gillian Arnot of the company for her sterling work in this regard.#Both Iona, and Catherine Dobbie of Campbeltown Community Council, are working tirelessly in an effort to secure the balance of the funding required.#Any donation large or small will be most welcome and will contribute to making Jock#s Adventure Playground inclusive and accessible to all children.#The swing-set – with an adapted seat with straps on one side and a wheelchair accessible swing on the other – will be installed in a vacant area at the council-owned playpark which currently has just one wheelchair accessible item.Iona was inspired to start the campaign after own experiences when taking her children, seven-year-old Esmie and four-year-old Lyle, who has autism, to playparks in Campbeltown and surrounding villages, and noticing the lack of equipment for children with less ability.So far, £, has been donated through an online fundraising page set-up with the aim of raising the additional £, required.In a bid to boost the total, Iona has organised the silent auction of a hamper of goodies donated by local businesses. Worth a combined total of about £, the hamper includes a one-night stay for four people at Ugadale Cottages a four-ball for Machrihanish Dunes Golf Club for four people one Serenity Spa hot stone back massage a selection of products from Serenity Spa and a bottle of -year-old Glen Scotia single malt whisky.The closing date for bids, which can be submitted privately via Iona#s Facebook page, is pm on Sunday .A further fundraising boost came thanks to two Campbeltown childminders, Sarah Mckeown and Carol Linfield, who organised two sponsored #teddy toddles# for the children who attend their settings.Sarah said: #Lyle has attended my setting for the past three years and we wanted to do something that the other children could join in with to help their friend raise the funds needed to purchase the inclusive play equipment.#There were two walks, last Thursday and on Monday, so all the children could take part. Ranging in age from one to five years old, the children and their teddies walked, ran and danced from the ferry terminal to the former paddling pool, where they received special medals and certicates and enjoyed a picnic. On Monday, they were joined by Lyle at the finish line.Visit gofundme f inclusive-swing-for-campbeltown-playpark to contribute to the fundraiser."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These campaigns testy not to an instinct for the #survival of the fittest# but to an inbuilt recognition that justice should be done.This should not be surprising. Our Creator is a God of justice made in his image, we reflect his character. He takes particular care to demand that minorities and vulnerable people receive, not just equality, but special respect and privilege and that justice should be upheld.Psalm : reads: #The Lord watches over the sojourners [racial minority], He upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked, he brings to ruin.# Justice is good.However, BLM and #Me Too aren#t sufficient to right society#s wrongs. Why  Because while pointing to the guilt of others, they fail to recognise we#re all guilty. We#ve all failed to love our neighbours as ourselves, we#ve all marginalised and discriminated against those not like us, even the protestor, even the victim perhaps not based on colour, but certainly on class, status or some other dference.This is where the Bible paints the full picture, justice is right, but reconciliation happens only through forgiveness. The Lord who leads in justice and who will judge all guilt, also leads in forgiveness. In the cross of Jesus, he absorbed the price of justice. He took the initiative. #While we were still sinners, Christ died for us#.The gt of God#s forgiveness is on offer. When we receive it and recognise all we#ve been forgiven, then forgiveness flows out to others and reconciliation begins."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema preparing to roll out the red carpet for reopening","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our successful recruitment is good news but wersquore now ndash with the exception of one GP, a nurse practitioner and the further call handlers ndash at the limit of the number of people we can employ at the practice yet we estimate that demand for appointments will still outweigh our capacity to provide them.He explained: ldquoWe must therefore continue to stress the urgent need for the full implementation of the  GMS Contract, which lays out the ious types of care due to be removed from the remit of general practice, in order to allow GPs to provide the expert medical care to the local community that we so desperately want to be able to do.He added: ldquoThis is widely recognised to be a challenging time to recruit GPs, with more GPs leaving the Scottish workforce each year than new GPs entering it.ldquoSo given this, wersquore especially delighted to welcome our two new GPs to the practice. Dr Maeve Chestnutt joined us from the Forth Valley Practice in March after relocating to East Lothian and Dr Michael Slowey has joined us last week from a practice in Sussex after locuming with us for a short time.He continued: ldquoWersquod also like to extend warm congratulations to Dr Kitto, who joins myself, Dr Cameron and Dr Stenke as a GP partner.Dr Fairclough said: ldquoTheirs arenrsquot the only new faces at the practice this year. Senior nurse practitioner Chris Gent has joined us as clinical manager from NHS , bringing his considerable clinical and operational experience to Riverside, along with nurse practitioner Sarah Miller.ldquoFinally, wersquore so pleased to welcome a further two new call handlers to our reception team, with more to follow shortly. Being a GP receptionist is such a challenging role, requiring a deep knowledge of how the surgery works, as well as calmness under pressure, and outstanding customer service skills.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement. It felt asthey had been in a dferent world.ldquoCan we camp tonight aunty  asked Finn. ldquoAnd have a campfire like the first night ldquoLetrsquos see how the weather holds and how we feel later, she replied, keeping options open.Food was now a priority and Izzy was keen to get away from the busyness of Tyndrum. Soon they were on their way, heading for Loch Tulla, where she planned to make their tea. She knew Ewen would already be at the Bridge of Orchy.

SunflowersLt spirits with this summer favourite loved by birds and bees. The flower heads come in a range of colours, from yellows to dark reds and oranges. You might want to pick a very tall iety such as American Giant, which can reach a towering height of around m.\"Sunflower seeds are large, making them easy for tiny hands to handle - they can be sown inidually in pots first and placed on a bright windowsill, or sown straight into the soil in a sunny spot. Sow them in May and keep them well watered,\" Cama advises. \"Watch out for slugs as the seedlings appear and support the stem with a cane as the plant gets taller. Sunflowers take about - weeks to grow from seed to flower.\"Add a sense of excitement and keep kids interested by having a sunflower growing competition, involving your household or street,\" suggests Cama. \"Or consider gting potted sunflower seedlings to friends and neighbours to brighten up their day.\". NasturtiumsNasturtiums not only look pretty, they have edible peppery-tasting flowers that are great for decorating summer salads. Carefully sprinkle the large seeds into cm-deep drills made in the soil and then cover up. Give trailing ieties a go by sowing them in a container or hanging basket.Children might enjoy keeping an eye out for caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly, which often munch their way through the leaves. These hungry caterpillars are interesting to watch and provide food for birds so its worth putting up with a bit of damage, Cama suggests.. Dwarf French beansPods of dwarf French beans can be eaten fresh from the plant or are delicious cooked up as a side helping of vegetables. French bean pods come in a range of dferent colours from green to cream and yellow to purple. Varieties include Cobra, Tendergreen, Purple Teepee and Purple Queen.This type of bean doesnt like the frost, so the end of May to early July is the ideal time to sow them outdoors, planted cm deep and cm apart.\"They grow to about cm tall so are best grown grouped together so the plants support each other. Another option is to collect twigs and push them upright into the ground to help keep the beans climb up and keep them off the soil. Remember to keep the beans well-watered, especially during dry weather,\" Cama advises.. Squash\"Squash are exciting to growyou have lots of space and they come in a huge assortment of dferent shapes, sizes and colours. One even has flesh that resembles vegetable spaghetti. Varieties include Sweet Dumpling, Crown Prince, Honey Bear, Sunburst and many more. You could even try growing a butternut squash,\" she suggests.Squash have very large seeds so are easy for little hands and fingers to plant. Sow in late May to early June and only plant them outside once all chances of frost have passed.Squash are very thirsty so keep them well watered, especially in the drier summer months.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

Sitting in the Macbobrsquos main auditorium with my sister-in-law I looked around to see two other people in the audience. Four seats filled in a venue that could hold, in pre-socially distanced times, . Such were the times.I didnrsquot really care much for the movie, an overengineered high-concept thing, to be honest. But it was good to be in a cinema again. Especially this cinema. This was where I did most of my student film-going back in the s. In more recent years Irsquove seen films in its smaller, custom-made cinema, but on this night we were in the larger theatre which was where my younger self had sat all those years ago.I spent a lot of time during Tenet thinking about the times Irsquod sat in this room before. The filmrsquos central idea ndash of two dferent time streams travelling in reverse directions and intersecting ndash only encouraged it.I found myself wondering thatI sat there long enough I might catch a glimpse of my younger self, sitting in this same cinema nearly  years before when I was a student, at a Saturday morning matinee of the s sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet, surrounded by kids, sitting beside a girl I was totally smitten with, who, in the timestream that was running forward from that moment, would later become my we.That thought ndash of being back in the same room in  with the person I loved most in the world but who had died in  ndash made the night worthwhile, evenI didnrsquot care much for the movie.In the absence of movie-going over the last year Irsquove been thinking a lot since last September about how cinema was at the heart of our relationship, and how our first days together were spent in the dark.The first time Irsquod ever had a proper talk with Jeanie was about the movies. A late-night conversation in the kitchen about an old screwball murder mystery wersquod both seen that summer called A Night to Remember, starring Loretta Young and Brian Aherne, a chat interrupted when a fellow student came in from a night out spent drinking Pernod and black and hiccupped up his evening all over the table. A few weeks later watching Paul Schraderrsquos Cat People at the Allanpark cinema in Stirling I watched Ed Begley Jr get his arm chewed off by a black leopard. In the film the blood washed across the floor and over Nastassja Kinskirsquos shoes just like the Pernod and Black across the table, I remember thinking.Those first few months with Jeaniewere spent at the movies. Afternoons and evenings all spent in the dark. Some days wersquod make a day of it, travelling through to Falkirk and the ABC cinema in the afternoon and then back to Stirling for an evening showing. We even watched the films now and then.Trashy horror was our favourite, though, thinking back, Irsquom not sure how appropriate The Entity ndash a lurid film in which Barbara Hershey is molested by an invisible demon, unmakeable nowndash really was as a date movie.Itrsquos a pretty normal pattern for a love story, isnrsquot it  Itrsquos what couples did, still do, . In Phantom Empire, his  book about cinema and its impact on us, the cultural commentator Geoffrey OrsquoBrien asks at one point, ldquoWhat did people do, anyway, before there were movies  Well, exactly.Cinema was our idea of fun. It was a pattern set in both our childhoods. Jeanie always told me that she had left the Brownies after she came home to find that her dad and her sister had gone to see Krakatoa, East of Java without her.Irsquod grown up in Northern Ireland watching Disney movies, James Bond films and Zulu at the local fleapit . I remember taking an Action Man pistol with me to see Jaws for reassurance.Irsquod go and see films and then rush back the next night to see them again. Good films, bad films, indferent films. Even the much-maligned  version of King Kong .Years later Irsquod tell its star Jeff Bridges that Irsquod seen it more than once. I think, I said, it might have been because of Jessica Lange. ldquoYeah, he agreed, laughing, ldquoit might have had something to do with her.Cinema was always a desire machine. The sex symbols of the th century were film stars . From Rudolph Valentino to Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean right up to Scarlett Johansson.Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It HotBut it was always about more than sex. The critic Molly Haskell writing in Film Commentrsquos new weekly newsletter the other week quoted Susan Sontag on the post-war embrace of the idea of the movies as art, ldquoborn of a conviction that cinema was an art unlike another: quintessentially modern, distinctively accessible poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral hellip That was still the case in the s and s when we started watching. In time, we fell in love with Chinarsquos Fth Generation filmmakersand the outrageousness of early Almodo.But cinema also offered what it has always offered a dream of escape, of lives unlived of glamour and aspiration at times. And also fear and anxiety and the thrill chill of the dark. A spectacle shared with other people sitting in the dark.Therersquos an electric thrill when a film is good to share it with an audience. The collective rush of it. Sometimes the audience are irritating, of course. Sometimes, they are the only fun. I remember watching some second-rate movie in New York. The rest of the audience were really into it, however, cheering and whooping at every action sequence. They made the movie more entertaining than it really was.And now here we are, after a year without movies, more or less . Therersquos a lot of hot air talked about how the pandemic might be the end of cinema. I donrsquot really buy it. It will take cinemas time to come to terms with the new situation as they are allowed to reopen, but audiences will .Cinema is changing, of course. In , Geoffrey OrsquoBrien could write with confidence, ldquoThe camera prowls around the room. This is how the eye works at the end of the twentieth century, after a hundred years of training.Does it still, nearly  years later  Do we have the patience to follow the camera around the room  Perhaps not. But then cinema has been changing throughout its history ndash from silent to sound, from movie palace to Cineworld box ndash and still it thrives. In , there were  million UK cinema admissions earning pound, million in box office takings. We may take some time to feel confident to , but we will. Because itrsquos a dferent experience to sitting in front of your laptop or TV screen.TenetThere are so many new films I want to see. Dune, Chloe Zhaorsquos take on Marvelrsquos Eternals, Baz Luhrmannrsquos Elvis movie , Edgar Wrightrsquos Last Night in Soho, Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Jordan Peelersquos take on Candyman, Wes Andersonrsquos The French Dispatch, Jane Campionrsquos Power of the Dog, Celine Sciamarsquos Petite Maman. All will turn up on streaming services, sooner or later. But to see them in the cinema is still the ultimate viewing experience. Size still matters.The last film I took Jeanie to see, a few weeks before her death, was Crawl, about a Florida hurricane and man-eating alligators. She loved a good scary movie. I am inordinately fond of this film now because it was the last time I got to sit in a cinema and hold her hand.I will never be able to do that again. But I can go and sit in the dark again. I can go and watch a movie and dream about the past and the future and lives lived and unlived.

She shouts over the clamour nonplussed - all that noise means action, le ing, businesses reopening.Not that her Borough Market restaurant, Mei Mei, has been dormant through the last year. Opening just a few months before the pandemic completely shuttered bars and restaurants, Haigh quickly pivoted to takeout, meal kits, and feeding the vulnerable and local key workers.Speaking a few days before outdoor dining resumed in England, shes buzzed. \"I cannot wait to share things on plates again Im sick to death of putting everything in takeaway packaging.\"Singapore-born Haigh, , trained as an architect before turning to food via a stint on MasterChef in . She went on to win a Michelin star while at Pidgin in Hackney. Now shes written her first cookbook, Makan, whose title means dinnertime, or lets eat. Haigh calls the book \"a love letter to my family\" and \"our Singaporean heritage\". Its packed with the Singaporean dishes she grew up eating , using seasonal ingredients found in Britain .In the book, she writes: When people move and mix together, food just gets better - and is adamant thats true, \"because food represents community. And without community, theres no food, theres no recipes, theres no knowledge of culture and dishes.\"She says peoples interpretation of Singaporean food is often confined to Singapore noodles, which is nonsense. \"One type of noodles in Singapore  It doesnt exist,\" Haigh scoffs. \"[That is] a fusion of someones idea of Singapore.\"While high streets tend to be brilliantly spiked with restaurants celebrating Indian, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese food, Singaporean restaurants often just arent in the mix. \"There are many great ones, but just not enough,\" says Haigh, and its that representation thats been missing.Partly its down to the exceptional culinary secret-keeping of Singaporean home cooks. \"Makan represents the culture of my mum,\" explains Haigh. \"She cooks a lot, like a lot of her generation, but they dont really pass on that knowledge because its just their way of showing love, that they do all the cooking.\"Haigh had to doggedly prise the knowledge out of her mum, but youll be glad she did. The recipes in the Nonya Secrets chapter, featuring her spiced chicken noodle soup, Gado Gado peanut salad, Malay hot and sour noodles, in particular are ones \"she would go probably to her grave withshe could I had to beg her to share them with me\".Telling her mum these very personal recipes were to be published in a book \"took some convincing\", but Haigh had a strategy. \"I promised a lot of cooking - and a dedication.\" It was also important to her to be able to make these dishes for her three-year-old son, Riley, so he could share them with his friends. \"Thats the way to get your mother, bribe her by using the grandson as leverage,\" she says wryly. \"I just wanted it to be normalised, so its a cuisine everyone recognises more, and that he can be proud of.\"In a climate where Asian hate is increasingly making headlines, exacerbated by Covid, and attacks on iniduals and businesses are escalating, representation is again crucial. \"Ive had that all my le, right \" says Haigh of anti-Asian racism. \"Im glad that everyones got more of a voice to stand up against it now, because its just not tolerable.\"If you normalise this style of cuisine and this food and people know more about Singaporean culture,\" she continues, \"it [becomes] normal. Its just representation it really does matter.\"Unravelling and then recreating her mothers recipes was a challenge in itself though Haigh had to translate her mums ingredient guestimation and dismantle some of the internal scaffolding of her own classical French training, \"building it back up again, as per how my mum wanted it to be\". She hadnt previously needed those recipes sequestered in her brain. \"Traditionally in my generation, not lots of Singaporeans cook,\" Haigh explains. \"In Singapore, were absolutely spoilt for choice by hawker food. Its more common to go eat somewhere because its so cheap.\"The homesickness involved in not being able to travel or access that delicious, clamorous street food world, was another motivation for Makan, \"to recreate those dishes and recreate those memories\".Ask her what shell do the second she can visit Singapore again, and Haigh is instantly imagining taking a taxi from the airport straight to her customary hawker. \"Ill probably be there with my dad, sitting at our usual table,\" she says. \"Well order all the satays, and a bucket of beer. And probably some barbecue chicken wings - everythings on the barbecue. And they have stingray as well, which is wrapped up in banana leaves and a layer of sambal tumis belacan [a spicy, limey sambal sauce with fermented shrimp paste]. And its just absolutely ine. For me, thats heaven. It hits you in the face, that chilli is so spicy. The chillies in Southeast Asia are just another level of heat.\"The moment dictates the meal: \"For Singaporeans, thats how we choose what we eat and when\". Soyou need something hearty, itd be her Hainanese chicken rice business on\" or a rendang. If under the weather, shed turn to noodle soups, and for celebrations, itd have to be Singapore chilli crab.Whatever the mood though, eating is paramount. Instead of saying Hello as a greeting, Singaporeans are likely to say, Are you hungry , or, Shall we get some food .\"Lets cut out the necessities,\" says Haigh with a laugh. \"Are we going to eat or not \" Andwhoever youre with isnt planning on eating, then \"its basically, Oh, are you gonna watch me eat \"Its that delight - in eating, cooking and trying food - that Haigh hopes to bestow. \"Im a feeder, just like my mum,\" she says. \"I wanted to write Makan so much because I wanted to share that joy.\" And you cant not feel it in every recipe.Makan: Recipes From The Heart Of Singapore by Elizabeth Haigh is published by Bloomsbury Absolute, priced pound.

The discussion is an especially hard one to have on these British isles of ours. To say Scotland has \"dferent\" values to England is either heavy with anglophobia, or weighted with inferiority.We donrsquot shy away from assigning dfering values to other nations, though. France and its muscular secularism America and its love of the gun Australia and its scorn for social class. Each example, however, is a stereotype. Not all French are secularist many Americans hate guns there are plenty of Australian snobs.Over the last week, two events on the streets of Glasgow almost demanded that we discuss whether Scotland really does have values which dfer signicantly to the rest of the UK: the protest against immigration deportations in Pollokshields, and the disgraceful scenes of Rangers fans rampaging through the city.Letrsquos deal with Rangers first. Itrsquos easier to address values we donrsquot like. What happened ndash the thuggery, violence, sectarianism, destruction ndash has been condemned across society. Itrsquos indefensible. It disgraced the country. But it happened, and itrsquos happened before. There may only be a few thousands of these people in Scotland, but whether we like it or not, theyrsquore what the world saw at the weekend. They project an image of Scotland. We cannot escape that in the eyes of others wersquore blighted by sectarianism, and the hooliganism and intimidation that always accompany it. To those watching from outside Scotland, what happened in George Square represents\"Scottish values\", just as much as the football hooliganism of the s blighted the reputation of England as a whole on the worldrsquos stage.Read more: Dark forces of sectarianism have come to exploit independence and the UnionThe horrible irony is that we here, inside our own country, know that the vast majority of us reject such behaviour ndash that only a handful of the population behave like this. Yet to an outsider, wersquore all tarnished with it. Just as all Americans are seen,wrongly, as \"gun nuts\", we here in Scotland are being labelled, wrongly, in the eyes of other countries, as a nation where bigotry prospers. Scotlandrsquos shame, indeed.We may define ourselves in opposition to events like these however,we mean that, then we must prove it. To validate that \"value\" ndash the idea that sectarianism has no home here ndash we have to stamp out the little fires of sectarian hatred still burning around this country. Jail is a good fire extinguisher for sectarian thugs. Crippling fines a good fire retardant for those in authority who fail in their duty to society.The events in Pollokshields also tell a dferent story of Scotland, in comparison to the rest of the UK. With sectarianism, we share baggage with Ulster in our broad attitudes to immigration, though, we seem quite alone. Nowhere  in Britain would have been the site of such resistance to the Home Officersquos \"hostile environment\" policy. When one thousand people on the south side of Glasgow compelled Border Force officers to back down and prompted police to release two of their neighbours set for deportation, a clear iding line was established between \"Scottish\" and \"British\" values.What happened last week in Pollokshields was not a one-off. This country has a proud pedigree of showing respect and care for refugees, as long opposition to dawn raids and Dungavel detention centre proves.And here we get to the heart of this apparently dfering value between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland is unique among most nations, itrsquos fair to say, on the issue of immigration. Brexit at its heart was an anti-immigration vote. Brexit didnrsquot appeal in Scotland. We didnrsquot vote to close our borders against outsiders. Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in Europe, was voting for peace and stability rather than expressing a pro-immigration position. A Pollokshields-style event is as unlikely in Ulster as it is in England. In UK terms, Scotland resembles those Democratic \"sanctuary cities\" during the Trump presidency.None of this is to say that there arenrsquot voters concerned about immigration in Scotland, or whorsquod like tighter restrictions. But immigration is ndash at least for the time being ndash a much less pressing political issue here than it is in England. Perhaps thatrsquos a legacy of decades-long dislike of the Tory Party, associated as it is with hardline anti-immigration policies. That antipathy may also account for Scotlandrsquos much more vocal opposition to austerity.Clearly, though, we also enjoy the luxury of opposition without responsibility. Itrsquos much easier to hate a policy when you donrsquot have to pass laws on it. Many Scots long opposed to British immigration policies, who also support the idea of an independent Scotland, have expressed worry at times thatwe ever do split with the UK, we might find our own liberal attitudes to immigration evaporating in some quarters.Immigration feels destined to become part of the constitutional debate. Only the foolish couldnrsquot envisage Project Fear II identying this social dference and exploiting the spectre of mass immigration.Read more: After the death of Mercy, Scots Government should break Westminster immigrationScotland is also at odds with Europe on immigration. France drts ever closer to the embrace of the far right and the lure of Marine Le Pen. The EUrsquos Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, positioning himself for a run at the French presidency, said he wanted to suspend immigration to France, including family reunions. Germany without Angela Merkel may become a cold place for refugees. Italy has set a hard face against those seeking sanctuary.For the time being ndash in limbo as Scotland is, a nation without the powers of a nation ndash we can see that wersquore \"dferent\", although that dference offers both blessings and curses. Sectarianism, whether we like it or not, shows a Scottish face to the world. Kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden, to refugees needing support and friendship, also shows a Scottish face to the world.Perhaps, therersquos some comfort in that strange mix.

There are plenty of them around already but the number looks set to increase markedly:  was a bumper year for orders and sales, and  looks set to top even that. According to Sam Tucker of nautical market intelligence firm VesselsValue, the market is ldquoabsolutely roaring ... Therersquos been a record number of transactions done, and that trend is being sustained even until now. Second-hand superyachts are selling quickly too.Who has a gigayacht Nobody you know, though a few people you may have heard of such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. According to news organisation Bloomberg, Bezos has commissioned a gigayacht from Rotterdam-based company Oceanco at a cost of pound million. The price tag wonrsquot trouble him though. His personal wealth is estimated to have doubled since  and now stands at around pound billion. And not only is he having a  foot gigayacht built, he has also commissioned a motorised superyacht support vessel for it. Because the main yacht is just that ndash it has three massive masts and is designed to travel under sail ndash this support vessel will house the helipad, a collection of luxury cars anda mini-submarine.So the gigayacht has some eco credentials Those which are wind-powered do. Another example is the Black Pearl, a slightly smaller gigayacht built by the same Dutch company for the Russian oligarch Oleg Burlakov. It has an aluminium superstructure and carbon fibre masts, generates its own electricity when itrsquos under sail, employs heat capture technology throughout and as a result is thought to be able to cross the Atlantic on a mere  litres of fuel. Then theres the sleek, Philippe Starck-designed Sailing Yacht A, owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, which was launched in . It has an underwater observation pod in the keel, soJeff Bezos trucks up alongside in his mini-sub the two moguls can wave at each other."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-gps-dedicated-making-difference-peoples-lives-workload-us-knees","story":"Pre-pandemic we offered a telephone triage service but patients could also make their own routine appointments.

A couple of hours later Irsquod be woken by a sozzled opera singer, wending his way home along Ingram Street and treating us to arias from Verdi and Puccini.Irsquod never lived anywhere like it, and even though I am now happily ensconced in the country, I miss the buzz and beauty of Glasgowrsquos majestic city centre. Yet there are some things I donrsquot pine for. Not long after I arrived, an independent grocer set up business, offering all the fruit, veg and granary loaves yoursquod ever need. Sadly, he didnrsquot last long, driven out by the proleration of micro-supermarkets. Soon it became harder to find a bag of red lentils than a magnum of champagne or a state of the art sound system.Children were as rare as ospreys. Yoursquod hear the purring of a Lexus as it idled at the lights, and at weekends the squealing of revellers tottering from club to club. But hardly ever did I see, let alone hear, a youngster. On our floor there were more French pugs than prams.The centre of Glasgow, with its high-end shops, restaurants, bars, and penthouse flats, prided itself on its glamour. Yet by the time we left, swathes of it had been turned into soulless student-land. This ever-shting community mirrored the wider picture: people living in self-contained pods, barely connecting with anyone .I never knew the names of our next door neighbours I couldnrsquot even have picked them out in an identity parade. As became increasingly apparent, you might have every extravagance money can buy within a five-minute walk, but painfully absent was a sense of community.The pandemic has highlighted a long-brewing problem. When shop and cafeacute shutters come down, students flee and the elderly retreat indoors, the centre becomes ghostly: a neighbourhood without a pulse.This unhealthy trend has not gone unnoticed. In recognition of the people-shaped hole at its heart, Glasgow City Council has devised a long-term plan to revivy the centre. Its Strategic Development Frameworksets out enlightened proposals aimed at regenerating six areas of the city, including what you might call the dead centre.For this zone, as with others, the aim is to transform it into a pedestrian-friendly and family oriented destination for day trips. At the same time the council wants to repopulate it, thereby making the area more appealing to residents who want to live there fully, rather than treat their flat as a bunkhouse. Along with initiatives to promote walking and cycling, and to reconnect the centre with surrounding districts, the hope is that by  its population will have doubled.No-one will miss the irony of trying to attract families back to an area that was once renowned for some of the highest-density housing in Europe. The demolition of overcrowded slums in the post-war era was seen as tackling disease and deprivation. Instead, the solution ndash tower blocks and housing schemes pushed to the outskirts ndash created arguably even worse problems. Meanwhile, the centre languished.It was this sort of short-sighted urban planning, which messed with peoplersquos lives, that the writer Jane Jacobs tore into. Her classic book, The Death and Le of Great American Cities ndash published in  but as fresh as todayrsquos newspaper ndash was a salvo against dehumanising architecture and development. When it came out, it was immediately understood, she said, by what she calls ldquofoot people: residents who either prefer to get around on foot, or wish they could ditch the car.Jacobs started out as a newspaper reporter, although she married an architect who, she wrote, taught her what she needed to become an architectural writer. That her views became so influential, despite her having no authority other than a clear mind and good taste, points to the obvious truth. Ordinary people instinctively know what makes a city tick: what works and what is doomed from the start.You donrsquot need a degree in urban planning to see that concrete wastelands, featureless parks or pigeon-hole flats in the sky are a recipe for misery. Or that well-designed green spaces allowing people to breathe completely change the mood and potential of a district. What Scotland needs right now is our own Jane Jacobs, to articulate the city dwellerrsquos view.The novelist John Cheever understood how hard it could be to pinpoint the problem. In The Wapshot Chronicle he describes a fictional scene: ldquoNorth of the park you come into a neighbourhood that seems blighted ndash not persecuted but only unpopular, asit suffered acne or bad breath, and it has a bad complexion ndash colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there.Most of us who know Glasgow ndash indeed almost any city in the world ndash could point to places this perfectly fits. Now, it seems Glasgowrsquos leaders are intent on fixing the problems previous generations of developers helped create. I wish them well. But, unfortunately, there are factors to be considered which are beyond the control of any planner.Quite how to address this is for others to consider, butGlasgow city centrersquos transformation is to succeed then solutions to such wildcat problems must be factored into its vision. It sounds daunting, but it is not necessarily an impossible task.Jane Jacobs believed that, ldquoLively, erse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.Irsquom no expert, but that sounds like Glasgow to me.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

DAVID PRATT: Europe facing far right threatThen, suddenly, enter stage left another upsurge in the long brewing dispute over who controls the al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem with clashes between Israeli police and Muslim protesters, followed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas lobbing rockets deep into Israel and Mr Netanyahu lives to fight another day.ldquoNetanyahu had no cards left to play, and suddenly, he was saved by the bell, was how Aviv Bushinsky, a former aide to Netanyahu, described this latest th hour reprieve for the Israeli leader. ldquoHersquos so lucky, every time, observed Mr Bushinsky, marvelling at his former bossrsquos good fortune.In fact, such was the timely intervention of this latest escalation of hostilities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that some among the ranks of Israelrsquos more conspiratorial political observers were even inclined to suggest that the prime minister might have had a hand in stirring up the crisis to undermine opposition to him.As political rival Yair Lapid noted last Sunday as the violence escalated, ldquothe fire always breaks out precisely when itrsquos most convenient for the embattled prime minister.Clashes in East JerusalemTherersquos little doubt that regarding Jewish-Arab relations, Mr Netanyahu over the years has done pretty much everything he could to exacerbate generations-old hatreds between communities.As back up to their claims that Mr Netanyahu was manipulating the recent crisis in the interests of political self-preservation, some analysts pointed to his allowing, even nurturing, domestic provocations in Palestinian east Jerusalem, with the pushing of Jewish settlements in neighbourhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and the fencing off of the Damascus Gate during Ramadan along with the heavy-handed police action at the Al-Aqsa mosque.Sceptics, however, say master political tactician as he is, even Mr Netanyahu could not have foreseen Hamasrsquos rocket attack on Jerusalem or the intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel.ldquoWas Netanyahu controlling things from A to Z  No. It was more likely half conspiracy and half contingency, was how Amos Harel, veteran military affairs reporter of the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz summed it up.In fact, therersquos a certain irony in that a flare up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should come to Mr Netanyahursquos aid. As Jonah Shepp in the New York Magazine recently highlighted, the current violence in fact ldquographically illustrates his failures.For not only has Mr Netanyahu ldquoburied the peace process, but ldquoforeclosed the possibility of a Palestinian state, brought virulently anti-Arab Kahanists into his government, and opted to lsquomanagersquo the conflict rather than resolve it. DAVID PRATT: Palestinians cast adrtStrange as it might seem,therersquos been one thing these past years that Mr Netanyahu has managed to do during his y time in office, itrsquos the way hersquos been able to detach the Palestinian issue from the lives of most Israelis. For the past few elections now, what was once a key issue for voters has not really played a signicant part in any campaigning.Writing in Haaretz last week Louis Fishman, an associate professor at Brooklyn College, described this as Mr Netanyahursquos ldquogreatest magic trick, effectively blinding Israeli Jews to their statersquos oppression of the Palestinians.Now, however, as the country experiences an unprecedented level of communal violence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel, the faccedilade that Mr Netanyahu has created is being starkly stripped away.ldquoEven the most carefully constructed house of cards eventually starts tumbling down, and that is exactly what is happening now hellip Impregnable Netanyahuism, the work of a master illusionist, is shattering, observed Professor Fishman.So, where does the -year-old Mr Netanyahu, who has seen off numerous rivals during histhree-decade career, go from here Clearly, the most obvious thing for now is that by scuttling his political rivalsrsquo chances of forming a coalition, the ongoing crisis with the Palestinians has bought Mr Netanyahu some time to change his fortunes.The most likely forthcoming scenario is that once Israel inevitably ldquowins this latest round of fighting in Gaza and has finished ldquomowing the grass, as some Israeli security officials offensively describe such military campaigns in the coastal strip, then Israel will probably go to the polls for a fth time.Whether the current violence gives Mr Netanyahu better odds this time around than in the previous ballots is altogether another question.ldquoFrom a political vantage point, this has put him back on the horse...thinspand hersquos riding it, said Yohanan Plesner, the director of the think-tank Israel Democracy Institute, speaking to the Financial Times as Mr Netanyahu vowed to step up the military response in Gaza.As the age-old adage goes, ldquoa week is a long time in politics and never has that been truer over the past seven days than for the Israeli prime minister. For so long now Benjamin Netanyahu has come to seem like a permanent fixture in his countryrsquos politics.

They say the impact of COVID- on womenrsquos employment in particular is now pushing many women and their children into greater poverty.Speaking on behalf of members of End Child Poverty John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: ldquoSolid foundations have been laid in Scotland for future progress on child poverty, not least the introduction of the Scottish child payment and an increasing focus on action at local level.\"But this new data is a stark reminder that child poverty was still rising in every part of Scotland, even before the pandemic struck. The challenge now is for government at all levels to use every power they have to boost family incomes and reduce the costs that struggling parents face.ldquoThe new Scottish parliament must act on election promises and make tackling child poverty its top priority. The cross party commitment to at least doubling the Scottish child payment needs to be implemented as a matter of utmost urgency in order to help meet the   targets. But child poverty also needs to be a priority at local level. Local powers, including over economic development, housing and welfare, must be used to maximum effect to ensure all families have a disposable income fit for giving children a decent start in le.The End Child Poverty coalition is also calling on the UK government to recognise the scale of the problem and its impact on childrenrsquos lives.They say a credible UK government plan is needed to end child poverty across the UK, including a commitment to increase UK child benefits. Given the extent to which families are already struggling, the pound per week cut to Universal Credit planned in October should also be revoked they say, with the support also extended to those still receiving financial assistance from the old benefit system, referred to as lsquolegacy benefitsrsquo, before they are switched to Universal Credit.Mr Dickie added: ldquoThe figures speak for themselves ndash the situation for children couldnrsquot be starker. We all want to live in a society where children are supported to be the best they can be, but the reality is very dferent for too many. The UK Government can be in no doubt about the challenge it facesit is serious about lsquolevelling uprsquo parts of the country hardest hit by poverty. After the year wersquove all had, they owe it to our children to come up with a plan to tackle child poverty that includes a boost to childrenrsquos benefits. And they need to scrap plans to cut Universal Credit given parents and children are having a tough enough time as it is.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWhile child poverty levels remain lower than in England and Wales, we are not complacent and are doing all we can to tackle and reduce child poverty in Scotland.ldquoWe are providing support worth about pound, by the time a child turns six through the Best Start Grant, Best Start Foods and Scottish Child Payment.

The online content, she adds, will allow valuable follow-up and let people from throughout Scotland see the skills and expertise concerned.In order to meet the  net carbon target, clients and statutory authorities have had to signicantly redefine their briefs, shting the focus of construction further toward low carbon imperatives, says Morrisonrsquos Low Carbon Manager Allan Smith who adds that it is the first tier one construction company to use Passivhaus, recognised as the gold standard in energy efficiency.Literally meaning ldquopassive house, the German term refers to buildings created design standards so that they maintain an almost constant temperature, with buildings that are so well constructed, ventilated and insulated that they retain heat from the sun and the activities of the buildingrsquos occupants, requiring very little additional cooling or heating.ldquoWe completed our first Passivhaus building in January, an early-years centre in West Lothian, and local authorities all over Scotland are now looking at the certication or similar methods in the construction of low-carbon buildings, says Smith.Advanced technology which uses D modelling and -degree photography to capture buildings means that people can virtually visit them and conduct the appropriate certication checks during construction. ldquoThe Covid pandemic has really elevated the use of such digital technology, says Graduate Design Manager Samantha Sweeney.ldquoWe use it on a daily basis, for instance in client engagement and change control and to coordinate with subcontractors. Having a model that we can employ on a day-to-day or even hour-to-hour basis is so much easier than dealing with hundreds of drawings.Caitlin Quinn adds that Morrisonrsquos involvement with Curious About Innovation is also an opportunity to spotlight the iety of careers available in construction.ldquoThese extend off-site ndash to writing proposals, creating animations, marketing and so on.ldquoMany people donrsquot realise the range of traineeships and graduate pathways that are open to them and wersquore passionate about getting that news out there, such as our graduate apprenticeship programme. Working with GSC will help us to do that.The company is also, she adds, passionate about creating a more erse workplace in what has traditionally been a male dominated industry. ldquoWhat wersquore trying to do with this presentation is show the need for collective effort and inspire young people with the digital tools wersquore using and the goal of low-carbon energy, adds Allan Smith."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12621530.jpg?type=article-full","title":"peel-road-celtic-chief-peter-lawwell-left-shaken-family-home-petrol-bombed-early-hours","story":"The Parkhead chief executive and his children were forced to flee their property when thugs targeted cars parked in the driveway, causing the fire to spread to the house.No one was hurt in the explosion but emergency services have locked down the area as they launch a probe into the fire.######### ######### ##A spokesperson for Celtic said:\"We can confirm that signicant damage has been caused to Peter Lawwellrsquos house and vehicles there, following an explosion and fire early this morning, forcing the family to leave the property.\" pic bZHeOA:Celtic chief Peter Lawwells home petrol bombed in early morning attackA spokesman for Celtic said: ldquoWe can confirm that signicant damage has been caused to Peter Lawwellrsquos house and vehicles there, following an explosion and fire early this morning, forcing the family to leave the property.ldquoClearly, Peterrsquos family are extremely shaken and shocked by these terrible events, but thankfully all are safe.ldquoWe understand that Police Scotland are currently undertaking a criminal investigation.ldquoPeter and his family will of course receive the full support and care of everyone at the club.Around  firefighters were scrambled to Thortonhall, to the south of Glasgow,at am today and remain on the scene.Police have closed off a road in Thorntonhall.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one. The comhairle and the health board can do exactly what they like with our island in the face of our expressed concerns. Lewis, by the way, is to have a new care home.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UIG-TIDY-UP-3-scaled.jpg","title":"uig beach clean volunteers remove two years worth of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCommunity members came out in force across the course of the day with their efforts culminating in a skip-load of rubbish being cleared from Uig beach.Young and old beach buddies worked hard to remove two years’ worth of waste which had accumulated since the last event in .shortly after the beach clean, Ross Watson, the north Scotland site manager for Woodland Trust Scotland said: “It was gloriously warm and we must have had around  people take part in the clean over the course of today.“It was also a great occasion for people to catch up, so there was probably as much chatting as there was litter picking.“We filled the whole skip and had to work really hard to fit everything in. There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight.

I want to create more opportunities for people to walk, wheel, cycle and use public transport as we know this not only leads to improved physical and mental wellbeing, it also helps tackle the climate crisis. “The proposed plans which will provide an additional + parking spaces at Ballymena Bus and Rail Centre are designed to meet present and anticipated future demand from passengers on this vital corridor. The site enjoys an excellent location on Galgorm Road, close to the town centre with pedestrian access to bus and rail facilities. “The development of the Ballymena Park  Ride is one of a number of schemes I am committed to progressing across Northern Ireland. Moreover, as I work to deliver the change our society needs, I want citizens to work in partnership with us to transform our local communities and deliver that lasting change. Therefore I would encourage the local community to respond to the public consultation process so we can deliver more together.”John Glass, Translinks Director of Infrastructure and Projects, said: ‘‘This will be a signicant project, providing much-needed additional capacity at one of Translink’s best used passenger facilities and facilitating growing passenger numbers on the vital Northern Rail Corridor. ‘‘Park and Ride is a key component of Translink’s plans for a ‘green recovery’ as we build back from COVID-, helping to reduce congestion in towns and cities and developing safer, healthier communities, as well as encouraging active and sustainable travel. ‘‘As our society moves forward in the years ahead, more sustainable transport modes, including public transport, will be essential and park and ride enables at least part of a journey to be made by public transport. ‘‘We intend to submit the formal planning application in the coming weeks, with the hope that planning approval will be granted shortly thereafter, which would allow works to get underway a few months later, with work completing in . ‘‘We want to encourage everyone to have their say in the public consultation programme which runs until Monday  June.

Over the last five years, a total of £m has gone towards temporary workers.The Belfast Trust had the highest agency staff bill in   at £m, followed by the Northern Trust at £.m and the Southern Trust at £.m. The Western Trust spent £m, the South Eastern Trust £.m, and the ambulance service £.m.Alliance health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw said legislative change is needed to bring these costs down.“Unfortunately this figure will only continue to increase as we continue to suffer from the inability over the years to manage workforce planning efficiently – from three years wasted without a legislative body, and as Brexit makes recruitment harder and less competitive, she said.Fundamentally what is required is for legislation to be brought in similarly to Great Britain to cap the gap in pay between agency and HSC workers. At the moment, too much money is going directly to agencies and too little directly to workers themselves.Rita Devlin, acting director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland, said the situation regarding nursing and midwery agency staff has been created by years of inadequate workforce planning and short term cost-saving measures, such as reducing the number of nurses trained here.“Reducing agency spend will only be possible when health and social care services and the independent sector are able to recruit and retain enough nursing staff to meet our needs, she said.“Related to this is ensuring that we retain the nurses we currently have so that we can deliver a safe level of care to patients. A fair pay increase is an essential part of any retention strategy. This needs to be sufficient to offset the pay dferential that exists between agencies and private health care providers and the health service.Ms Devlin said nearly , nursing vacancies exist in the health and social care system, with similar numbers in the independent sector, which cause the cost of agency staff to reach unsustainable levels.While the current levels of expenditure are completely unacceptable, the reality is that they are plugging gaps which should never have been allowed to develop, she said.The Department of Health said it recognises the increasing agency costs are not sustainable.The Bengoa expert  report warned of “stark increases in costs associated with locum and agency staff to provide a safe service where it is not possible to recruit to permanent positions, it said. The report made clear that rising locum and agency costs are due to the current configuration of services and that ‘changing the model of care’ is the only solution.”The department said a strategy was published in , setting out goals “for a workforce that will match the requirements of a transformed system addressing the need to tackle serious challenges with supply, recruitment and retention of staff.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBelfast restaurant expands to three times its size as Republic shutdown forces diners northUnauthorised mystery cameras installed around Tyrone vanish after police alertedBelfast fourth most expensive place in UK for pintsPrince Charles told it #never rains in south Armagh# during whistle stop tour of Slieve Gullion Forest Park‘I was regularly cycling  miles each weekend... the diagnosis of cancer left me flabbergasted’Top Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-d-ef-b-fcfb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-d-ef-b-fcfb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles follows in late father’s footsteps with visit to Belfast shipyardPlayWatch: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlayFirefighters battle blaze on Belfast#s Lisburn RoadLatest HealthCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two further deaths and  cases reported as region passes m first vaccine dosesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageHancock criticised over travel restrictionsBelfast restaurant expands to three times its size as Republic shutdown forces diners northCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death and  new cases reportedLatestFootball fans angry as Uefa cancels European Championship ticketsCeltic chief Peter Lawwell and family flee home after explosion and firePremier Foods pays first idend since  after ‘outstanding year’Demi Lovato updates fans on new pronounsAmbassadors back plan to allow vaccinated UK tourists to visit EU this summer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

anniversary of the company, which fell into administration in  before being bought by Infrastrata.He told the workers: “I’m so pleased to hear that there is all sorts of potential new activity here and new fabrication opportunities... and I hope you could encourage a lot more of the young to become apprentices and understand the importance of manufacturing, and to also understand how this country has led the way in so many of these areas.”Both Charles and Camilla later visited Belfast City Hall where they were welcomed by Lord Mayor Frank McCoubrey.The heir to the throne then met and

It is in everybody’s interests that the media report these things.”Read MoreDerry Sinn Fein in turmoil: ‘The party’s status has plummeted... there was no choice but to investigate’O’Neill commends Anderson, but says SF removal necessaryHe questioned whether the media had been “infiltrated” or were “afraid” to investigate such issues.Mr Blaney, Fianna Fail’s spokesperson on Northern Ireland, also made reference to the brother of former Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, Liam Adams, who was a convicted pedophile.“Gerry Adams’s brother was placed in a Donegal house for three years and had charges of paedophilia made against him. No media would ever touch that story,” he said. “Everyone knew about it in Donegal but nobody would touch it. Our democracy is under attack. It is time our media spoke up and woke up and we got independence for all parties in this State.”He also called for a “much wider” investigation into the Sinn Fein’s online ‘Abu’ voter database. “Sinn Fein is spending tens of thousands of euro week in, week out on newspapers, media and independent journalists across the country and they can attack anybody on social media with the drop of an email,” he said.“Our democracy is under attack at the moment. We are talking about cyberattacks.

I’m actually mainstream, it’s the media who aren’t mainstream.”He continued: “The media mightn’t like the fact that someone who has a faith is in the public square but that’s up to the public to decide, not the media.”Following cancer surgery earlier this year, Mr Poots described his current state of health as “absolutely super”.“In the first four-and-a-half months of this year, I have had two grandchildren, serious surgery and now an election to lead the largest party in Northern Ireland so it hasn’t been a bad year thus far in terms of being eventful, we’ll see how eventful it is in the rest of it,” he said.On his previous objection to issues like civil partnerships, he said it was an issue the BBC were obsessed with.“I tend to think people actually obsess about their education, their health, whether they have a job to go to,” he said. “I’m focused on that for people who are in same-sex relationships and who are in erse relationships.”Ahead of his confirmation as DUP leader, Mr Poots told the PA news agency he would treat members of the LGBT community like he would anyone , as he expressed a desire to create a Northern Ireland where everyone is free to be what they wish to be. Mr Poots recalled a republican paramilitary murder bid on his late father Charlie as he expressed determination that Northern Ireland would not slip back to the dark days of the Troubles.I am a child of the Troubles — I recognise the impact the Troubles had on my le growing up. We had the hand of death wanted to be inflicted on our own home. Thankfully, it wasn#t successful.But I don#t want future generations to be going through that.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBelfast restaurant expands to three times its size as Republic shutdown forces diners northUnauthorised mystery cameras installed around Tyrone vanish after police alertedBelfast fourth most expensive place in UK for pintsPrince Charles told it #never rains in south Armagh# during whistle stop tour of Slieve Gullion Forest Park‘I was regularly cycling  miles each weekend... the diagnosis of cancer left me flabbergasted’Top Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-d-ef-b-fcfb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-d-ef-b-fcfb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles follows in late father’s footsteps with visit to Belfast shipyardPlayWatch: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlayFirefighters battle blaze on Belfast#s Lisburn RoadLatest NewsSpain’s African enclave struggles to handle migrant influxFootball fans angry as Uefa cancels European Championship ticketsCeltic chief Peter Lawwell and family flee home after explosion and fireAmbassadors back plan to allow vaccinated UK tourists to visit EU this summerPregnant Beatrice to welcome first child, Palace announcesLatestSpain’s African enclave struggles to handle migrant influxFootball fans angry as Uefa cancels European Championship ticketsCeltic chief Peter Lawwell and family flee home after explosion and firePremier Foods pays first idend since  after ‘outstanding year’Demi Lovato updates fans on new pronouns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Applications were recently made for new bilingual street signs at Ballynagard Close and Elmvale. Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application. Previously, from those who reply to the councils correspondence, a minimum of % of respondents had to support the new street sign proposal for it to be granted. However, in January of this year, the council agreed to reduce this threshold to %. The applications for new street signs at Ballynagard Close and Elmvale, however, were all based on the previous threshold. googletag.cmd.push In relation to Ballynagard Close, a total of  households were contacted in relation to the application. Of these households, four responded to the council. Three of the occupants who responded were in favour of the bilingual street sign, while one was against it. Therefore, this represents % of residents who responded being in support on the proposed new street sign. At Elmvale,  households were contacted by the council. Of these, responses were received back from  households. A total of % of the Elmvale households who responded were in support of the new street sign, with % opposed to it. googletag.cmd.push As a result, new bilingual street signs will now be erected by the council at both Ballynagard Close and Elmvale. Januarys decision by the council to reduce the bilingual street sign threshold from % to % was criticised by unionist councillors. They described it as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area. However, those who backed the decision said it would promote equality within local communities.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To mark the milestone, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Brian Tierney, has revealed that the local council will be covering the cost of the playing pitches for the season. Mayor Tierney attended the launch of the event at Clooney Park Weston Monday night where the gesture was announced that he would pay for approximately  games between the teams who have registered for the league’s centenary year. Speaking at the event, which took place before the game between Foyle Harps and Lisahally,he praised the network of volunteers who have helped bring the league to this signicant milestone and wished the teams well in their bid to have the distinction of winning the centenary league title. googletag.cmd.push “The Derry and District League has played a central role in community of le for a century now offering recreation and a  for footballers to express themselves,” he said. “Some of the best players to come out of the city cut their teeth in the league including Liam Coyle, Paddy McCourt and more recently Shane Duffy and Aaron McEneff who benefited from the chance to play against men in their formative years. “The league is completely amateur and the games are only made possible by the dedication of the network of volunteers who look after the signicant administration required to run it from booking pitches and referees to organising fixtures and tables. googletag.cmd.push “I would have loved the opportunity to recognise that dedication in the form of a civic reception at the Guildhall however I hope my covering of the cost of the pitches will go some way towards making up for that disappointment.” League Spokesperson,Christy McGeehan, thanked the Mayor for his gesture. This is a great gesture from Mayor Tierney and shows that Council value the central role the league has played in the Derry community over the years, he said. We are delighted with the high number of clubs who have registered for this years league and hopefully the centenary year will mark a resurgence for the league as numbers have been lower in recent years.     We have a thriving underage league and I am delighted that more of the clubs are now fielding a senior mens team as it keeps more young players involved in the game and the opportunities and pathways it offers them to develop.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mayor Tierney attended the launch of the event at Clooney Park Weston Monday night where the gesture was announced that he would pay for approximately  games between the teams who have registered for the league’s centenary year. Speaking at the event, which took place before the game between Foyle Harps and Lisahally,he praised the network of volunteers who have helped bring the league to this signicant milestone and wished the teams well in their bid to have the distinction of winning the centenary league title. googletag.cmd.push “The Derry and District League has played a central role in community of le for a century now offering recreation and a  for footballers to express themselves,” he said. “Some of the best players to come out of the city cut their teeth in the league including Liam Coyle, Paddy McCourt and more recently Shane Duffy and Aaron McEneff who benefited from the chance to play against men in their formative years. “The league is completely amateur and the games are only made possible by the dedication of the network of volunteers who look after the signicant administration required to run it from booking pitches and referees to organising fixtures and tables. googletag.cmd.push “I would have loved the opportunity to recognise that dedication in the form of a civic reception at the Guildhall however I hope my covering of the cost of the pitches will go some way towards making up for that disappointment.” League Spokesperson,Christy McGeehan, thanked the Mayor for his gesture. This is a great gesture from Mayor Tierney and shows that Council value the central role the league has played in the Derry community over the years, he said. We are delighted with the high number of clubs who have registered for this years league and hopefully the centenary year will mark a resurgence for the league as numbers have been lower in recent years.     We have a thriving underage league and I am delighted that more of the clubs are now fielding a senior mens team as it keeps more young players involved in the game and the opportunities and pathways it offers them to develop.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After stepping down, he succeeded Damian McErlain as Derry boss.After being brought into his management team by Gallagher in Fermanagh, Ryan McMenamin succeeded him as manager.“Ive worked with Riceyand a number of them. My own brother Ronan is involved,” Gallagher said.“There are nice friendships there, but they will be set to one side. I have very fond memories and a lot of great days with the players and there is a lot of new players as well. “That goes out the window, theyll be trying to cut my throat and I will be trying to cut theirs.” Derry only picked up one point from their opening two games last season and Gallagher felt the Gods were against his side with their  league draw.“We were very disappointed with the start we got to the league last year. We have to man up to it now and we have to face Fermanagh,” Gallagher added, after Saturdays win over Longford.Gareth McKinless was replaced during the game with cramp and will be grand for this weekend. Karl McKaigue will be in contention and the Derry boss hopes to have the Slaughtneil man on the bench, while Conor McCluskeywont be far away.Gallagher was delighted with the performance of Conor Glass who kicked two points, the first of his senior inter-county career on Saturday night“I am just delighted to get him in, he is a brilliant fella, he is a massive addition and he is a physical presence that we didnt always have,” the Derry manager stated.Summarising their -point victory, Gallagher said his side wouldve have learned the potential they had to do very enjoyable things in football and classed Derry as a very good team.“We have to prove it every day and commit to each other,” he stressed. “There are very few teams like Dublin, who just win, win, win. You have got to learn how to graft and earn victories. I hope the boys see the potential that we can have.”Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more.I was bitterly disappointed we only had eight points at half-time, we shouldve been sitting with - or - at our ease and that was relying Niallkicking a couple of fties in tough conditions.I felt we left scores too easily behind and to be honest,Longford had been more clinical or when you move up the gears against opposition higher up the isions wed have suffered for it.Derry dipped into their bench on Saturday night, with Ben McCarron notching a point and Conleth McShane coming on to make his debut, a th across Gallaghers  games in charge to date.“We brought himin last year before the championship, he is a really committed lad. It is a great reward for him, as it is for the others. We want to get as much game time into players, to develop a squadwe can.” Derry senior hurlers will be back in league action on Sunday against Kildare in Hawkfield .After a narrow defeat in Round , Derry had a bye last weekend. Kildares only game so far was their - to - mauling of Donegal in Newbridge.Brian Byrne hit  points for the current Christy Ring Champions, with goals from James Burke , Johnny Byrne and Conor Dowling.Derry beat Kildare two years ago and last seasons clash ended level thanks to a late Conor Kelly point.Mayo sit top of the table on four points after back to back wins.

After stepping down, he succeeded Damian McErlain as Derry boss.After being brought into his management team by Gallagher in Fermanagh, Ryan McMenamin succeeded him as manager.“Ive worked with Riceyand a number of them. My own brother Ronan is involved,” Gallagher said.“There are nice friendships there, but they will be set to one side. I have very fond memories and a lot of great days with the players and there is a lot of new players as well. “That goes out the window, theyll be trying to cut my throat and I will be trying to cut theirs.” Derry only picked up one point from their opening two games last season and Gallagher felt the Gods were against his side with their  league draw.“We were very disappointed with the start we got to the league last year. We have to man up to it now and we have to face Fermanagh,” Gallagher added, after Saturdays win over Longford.Gareth McKinless was replaced during the game with cramp and will be grand for this weekend. Karl McKaigue will be in contention and the Derry boss hopes to have the Slaughtneil man on the bench, while Conor McCluskeywont be far away.Gallagher was delighted with the performance of Conor Glass who kicked two points, the first of his senior inter-county career on Saturday night“I am just delighted to get him in, he is a brilliant fella, he is a massive addition and he is a physical presence that we didnt always have,” the Derry manager stated.Summarising their -point victory, Gallagher said his side wouldve have learned the potential they had to do very enjoyable things in football and classed Derry as a very good team.“We have to prove it every day and commit to each other,” he stressed. “There are very few teams like Dublin, who just win, win, win. You have got to learn how to graft and earn victories. I hope the boys see the potential that we can have.”Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more.I was bitterly disappointed we only had eight points at half-time, we shouldve been sitting with - or - at our ease and that was relying Niallkicking a couple of fties in tough conditions.I felt we left scores too easily behind and to be honest,Longford had been more clinical or when you move up the gears against opposition higher up the isions wed have suffered for it.Derry dipped into their bench on Saturday night, with Ben McCarron notching a point and Conleth McShane coming on to make his debut, a th across Gallaghers  games in charge to date.“We brought himin last year before the championship, he is a really committed lad. It is a great reward for him, as it is for the others. We want to get as much game time into players, to develop a squadwe can.” Derry senior hurlers will be back in league action on Sunday against Kildare in Hawkfield .After a narrow defeat in Round , Derry had a bye last weekend. Kildares only game so far was their - to - mauling of Donegal in Newbridge.Brian Byrne hit  points for the current Christy Ring Champions, with goals from James Burke , Johnny Byrne and Conor Dowling.Derry beat Kildare two years ago and last seasons clash ended level thanks to a late Conor Kelly point.Mayo sit top of the table on four points after back to back wins. In the absence of a league final, only the top team will gain promotion to Division A. googletag.cmd.push ALSO READ - Derry ease to opening win in Longford.

Where have the Austerity Brothers George Osborne and David Cameron gone  Cameron has his own problems but Osborne is still bleating the balance the books mantra from the sidelines. I cant see that anytime soon. So, post Covid- what can we expect      Well for one thing Covid- has hit society in a way not seen since WW. I am old enough to remember the recession of the s and this is much worse than that. In the USA, President Biden has come out of the stalls clearly indicating that he wants to pump prime the economy with a major overhaul of decaying infrastructure. Its been hailed by many as a version of the post Great Depression New Deal delivered by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It really got the US back on its feet. Many across the island of Ireland are looking for a new normal. Of course, we all want to get rid of masks and go for a pint etc. but to slide back into a society driven by economic greed isnt as appealing any more. A lot has changed. The last  months has put many sectors in the spotlight. We have all clapped for health workers and carers but prior to all this, their pay and conditions didnt really interest us so much. This was the same for many of the jobs which during the Covid crisis became frontline. Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, cleaners and the people stocking the shelves of our supermarkets. Now, most of us appreciate the role they do and their pay and conditions matter more to us than ever. Without these people risking their lives and long term health society would have collapsed. Most of them didnt have the option to work remotely. They showed up and took care of the sick. They scrubbed down rooms or beds where Covid patients had been.  The point is they showed up and we now have a chance to reset our society and replace the clapping with a better salary. For me,it means a bit extra in tax, Im happy to pay it. Now when I see - Deliveroo drivers waiting outside a Take-away for a job I cant help but feel sorry for their plight. Before I was oblivious to it but now, I see just how unfair society has got. Some person designs an algorithm and sits in Calornia and earns billions while a delivery drivergets minimum wage. Many are now calling for a social revolution across society. Ive heard build back better and build back stronger bandied about like snuff at a wake but it makes perfect sense. In Derry, we have saw throughout this crisis a number of community organisations across the city step up and work in partnership with DCSDC and central government. Their roots are in the community and without their involvement during Covid- many more people would have died or slipped deeper into poverty. We really need to build on that. For me, there needs to be a major rethink at central and local government level on how we deliver the recovery. A cornerstone for this needs to be a recognition of the important role the community and voluntary sector play. We must mobilize these communities and connect with them and most importantly invest in them. If local or central government want to do community planning then invest real money in it and forget these detailed desk based action plans which often have no resources behind them but look great on a PowerPoint. And when you think about it who is best placed to help young people within some of our most disadvantaged get jobs. We have had an economic policy for the last  years which mixes encouraging and supporting indigenous businesses whilst attracting Foreign Direct Investment . Its had some success but it hasnt taken Derry off the top of the unemployment league for the North. There are quite a few other communities it has failed. Its now time to recognise that empowering organisations within these communities and backing them financially is the way to see jobs and a better society. And how do we do it  Within the North I would empower the Department of Communities and give it the budget to deliver it. They could jointly deliver this with Invest NI through the Department for Economy. That would be the best model for delivery. I would also put social enterprise and its promotion on a par across the island. There is no reason why more of our young people keen to start a business wouldnt decide on this structure. All the social enterprises I know make profits. Its what they do with these profits which is dferent. They reinvest in the staff and community instead of paying idends. Many others use profits to provide vital services in their communities. Many young people are already starting social enterprises and others are seeing a career working in a social enterprise in a dferent light. The biggest problem is that most people think social enterprises are confined to a sector. Theyre not. It’s more a way of doing a business rather than a specic sector. We have one chance to get this right as hopefully Covid is a once in a letime event. Already initiatives like Buy Social from the Department of Finance are recognising social capital in all their tenders. We need to do more, however. Lets not go back to the old normal because lets face it, things were not so great. President Harry Truman attempted a New Deal in the USA after WW. His  point plan which included developing a US version of the NHS and many other things failed. He also wanted to increase minimum wage and tackle some of the civil rights issues still visible in the US.It failed and most of the  objectives where never met. Lets hope we can learn from Covid and unlike President Harry Truman deliver a fair deal to everyone in society. Trickledown economics is a myth folks and its time we value people and work with our communities here to build a fairer society.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The biggest problem is that most people think social enterprises are confined to a sector. Theyre not. It’s more a way of doing a business rather than a specic sector. We have one chance to get this right as hopefully Covid is a once in a letime event. Already initiatives like Buy Social from the Department of Finance are recognising social capital in all their tenders. We need to do more, however. Lets not go back to the old normal because lets face it, things were not so great. President Harry Truman attempted a New Deal in the USA after WW. His  point plan which included developing a US version of the NHS and many other things failed. He also wanted to increase minimum wage and tackle some of the civil rights issues still visible in the US.It failed and most of the  objectives where never met. Lets hope we can learn from Covid and unlike President Harry Truman deliver a fair deal to everyone in society. Trickledown economics is a myth folks and its time we value people and work with our communities here to build a fairer society.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing. As a teacher myself I think its great to have such books for children showing ersity.Cara inspired a new fashion range earlier this year for girls and teens born with the same condition as her.She hopes to be a spokesperson and campaigner for people with dwarfism in the future.The Irish Roots Festival, created by Tipperary native Lorraine Maher, finishes today.Speaking about the festival, she said: ldquoMixed-race people are one of the fastest growing demographics in the western world, it is crucial to highlight the lives, achievements and struggles of mixed-race Irish people.ldquoThis is a great opportunity to give a shout out globally to those of Irish ancestry regardless of colour or location, she said. ldquoRepresentation is so important for a sense of well-being and belonging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Developers.jpg","title":"Developers invited to enter bids for redevelopment site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will be asked within the next few weeks to submit their respective bids for the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police base in Downpatrick.The news was confirmed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee on Monday evening.Stretching back as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, the proposed development site includes the Irish Street car park and a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base.It is understood that five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand the local authorityThe development brief paves the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site and developers will be given up to  weeks to submit their respective proposals with a final assessment then made to select the preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, the company will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Councillors were due to discuss a motion at Monday nightrsquos meeting which urged the council to acquire land to create a road access through the development site on to St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of the redevelopment proposal and also upgrade and integrate three adjoining privately owned car parks into the proposal.Debate on the motion was adjourned, but in papers submitted prior to the committee meeting senior council staff made it clear that any change would result in the suspension of the development brief and changes to the projectrsquos business case.The local authority has been working on the Irish Street project in partnership with the DfC for some time and when the police base became available for sale, the local authority commissioned a feasibility study exploring options around how the site could be developed in tandem with the Irish Street car park.The study concluded that a so-called mixed use development of the sprawling site would be the most suitable option with the government department subsequently acquiring the land, with the local authority purchasing a strip of land between the Irish Street car park and the former police base.A project board was then set up comprising Downpatrick area councillors and a number of local stakeholders including business community representatives which sought the views of developers and the local community around the sitersquos potential uses and constraints.It was confirmed on Monday night that based on the feedback the development brief was worked up and will go to market in the coming weeks. Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run. This fired up Eoin Moag to produce another fine over and clean bowl A Lawther.Ards were now well on the back foot at  for . Captain Reilly took another wicket in the following over before handing the reins to Keba Butler, who promptly took a wicket with his fourth ball.Newcomer Matthew Douglas was introduced into the attack to replace Moag and was soon also among the wickets with only his fourth delivery for the club.This was followed up by Kristofer McNeill coming from behind the stumps to bowl mdash his two overs going for  runs, but also gaining wicket.With Dundrum now firmly in the driving seat, the bowling was passed around with youngsters Andrew Campbell and James Wright bowling well.Experienced clubmen Andrew Hammond and James Orr came on with James taking his first wicket of the season and Ardsrsquo last batsman to give Dundrum victory by  runs.A massive result for the club made possible by a dedicated ground staff, driven committee and some excellent work with young people in the surrounding area which has enabled the thirds to field five U- players, all of whom will be vying for a spot next week and maybe even the seconds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 16%2C 2001  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash The project to transfer one of Ballynahinchrsquos most prestigious buildings was officially launched last week.The historic Market House in Ballynahinch is to get a new lease of le and over the coming months will be transformed into a new civic building during a near poundm redevelopment project.The scheme will complete the Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committeersquos plans to transform the heart of the town and complement the redeveloped square.Local planning chiefs are expected to give the scheme the green light within the next few weeks and preliminary work to strip plaster from the building has revealed ornate stone work and archways which are to be incorporated in the design of the new civic facility.The chairman of the Regeneration Committee, Mr Vincent Fullam, said the public launch of the Market House project marks the end of a long crusade which involved numerous meetings.KILLYLEAGH ndash The future of a multi-million pound marina and housing project for Killyleagh is expected to be known next month.Local planning officials are expected to announcethey are prepared to allow the controversial scheme planned for the Gocean area in the town when they meet local politicians.Speculation is mounting the poundm plan will be refused, but planners have confirmed they have still not reached a final decision on the issue, explaining they are still heavily involved in discussions with a number of organisations.They say it would be wrong to draw any conclusion at this stage as the consultation process is far from complete.It had been widely predicted a public inquiry would be ordered into the project but after its detail was scrutinised by senior planners in Belfast, they passed it back to planners based at Rathkeltair House in Downpatrick and told them there would be no public scrutiny of the scheme.DUNDRUM mdash A call has been made for a review of planning in Dundrum before the beauty of the village is ldquolost forever.The request has been made by SDLP candidate, Mr Charlie McGrath, who says the pace of new housing developments in the area raises a number of issues which need to be addressed.Mr McGrath, a candidate in the Newcastle area, has said it will be too late for locals to complain about the shape of the area after the developers and planners had finished with the village. He has called for a debate into the problem ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Mr McGrath, who is also concerned about the lack of facilities for local residents, said he has written to the local banks about providing cash points and is ldquovery encouraged by the response. He is also pleased that replacement pubic toilets are again to be provided in the village.He said that with the influx of young families in the area there is a ldquoglaring need for youths facilities such as playgrounds and has commended the work of the Dundrum Forum for Play in raising the profile of what he called an ldquounderestimated need.DOWNPATRICK mdash The Great Hall at the Downshire

billed as a prestigious community facility following the extensive renovation programme.It is hoped that once the hall, which boasts state-of-the-art sound and lighting equipment, opens for business, it will be widely used for a number of events for patients, staff and local people.SAINTFIELD mdash A Rowallane area councillor has said the development of a town park in Saintfield is still at the top of his agenda.The DUPrsquos William Dick, who is seeking re-election when voters go to the polls next month, said the creation of a town park is already included in Down Councilrsquos capital

But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region.

Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale.

We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area.

Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our bike share schemes are there to benefit the whole community, which is why we want to hear from as many people as possible.Nextbike docking stations have to be close to popular destinations such as existing transport links, job centres, supermarkets and other shops be in an area of high footfall be highly visible and easy to find have enough space to allow safe movement of pedestrians and people with limited mobility and be accessible by van or bike trailer to allow the nextbike service team to maintain the bikes and stations.     Final decisions will be made based on the above criteria, in addition to the ability to get power to the locations, which is determined by power providers.Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe nextbike e-bike hire scheme in Penarth has proved extremely successful.\"Since its launch, the hire of the bikes has been steadily increasing.ldquoWith the onset of summer, we have implemented a new docking station at Cosmeston, and very soon there will be a new docking station in Sully.\"I am convinced the scheme will only go from strength to strength.ldquoTwo additional docking stations in Dinas Powys will complement the existing nextbike network within the Vale of Glamorgan and provide an additional sustainable transport link between these three areas.\"I would encourage Dinas Powys residents to respond to the consultation as itrsquos important they are located where they are accessible to as many people as possible.Penarthrsquos existing stations are located at the Esplanade, Llandough Hospital, Windsor Road, Penarth Train Station, the Barrage and the recently-installed Cosmeston.While the Penarth bikes can currently only be rented and ed to Penarth stations, the ambition is to eventually link the scheme to nextbikersquos Cardf fleet, meaning commuters will be able to use the e-bikes to make the journey between the town and the city with ease.E-bikes are a combination of a conventional bike with a motor that take some of the effort out of pedalling for the rider. With top speeds of km per hour, the e-bikes can cover greater distances in less time and with less effort than conventional cycles.E-bike rental costs pound per  minutes for customers with a monthly or annual membership, or pound per  minutes on a pay as you ride basis.The consultation runs until May .
