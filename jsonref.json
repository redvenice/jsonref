After decades in the trade, during which he broke major stories and occupied some of the most senior editorial chairs, he retired on Thursday with a short speech to colleagues and friends. Thanking the entire staff, he reflected briefly on the “buzz” he had received from journalism – a description that secured him one of his earliest jobs – and how it had remained with him throughout his life.

In his earlier years he was editor of the Trinity News college newspaper and though his professional life both began and ended at The , the intervening years brought him to the newsrooms of London’s Fleet Street and into various senior positions. His early success delivered him to The Sunday Times in London where he became editor of famed Insight investigative unit. Following this he spent eight years at , as both deputy foreign editor and news editor, before returning to Ireland in 1994 to edit the now defunct Sunday Tribune. During his second term in The , he would fill the roles of Saturday news features editor, foreign editor, duty editor and managing editor, before once more rolling up his sleeves for a last burst of news reporting.

Photograph: Kenzo TribouillardAs European Union leaders debated the length of the Brexit extension to offer Theresa May in Brussels late on Wednesday night, they heard persuasive arguments on both sides. Advocates of a long extension of up to a year, led by Angela Merkel, argued that Britain’s political system needed time to find a way through the Brexit deadlock, perhaps with a general election or a second referendum.But Emmanuel Macron warned that anything more than a short extension would encourage Britain to believe that the EU was unwilling to countenance a no-deal Brexit and would do almost anything to avoid it. By splitting the difference and offering a six-month extension, the leaders have produced the worst of both worlds, as Thursday’s debate in the House of Commons showed.Brexiteers railed against the prime minister for accepting the extension but they also scented weakness on the EU side, which the DUP’s Nigel Dodds said had blinked in the face of a threat of a no-deal Brexit.‘Backed down’“Until yesterday, the EU was saying very clearly that unless there was a credible plan for an election or a referendum, or a prospect of getting the withdrawal agreement through soon, it would not grant an extension, and that if it did, there would be stringent conditions. In fact, it held to neither of those statements. When it was faced with the unpalatable choice of a no-deal, it backed down,” he said.Advocates of a second referendum celebrated the six-month delay, which they claimed was long enough to allow the government put the question to the people again. And although the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn met on Thursday afternoon, few at Westminster hold out much hope that the current talks between the government and Labour will produce a common approach to Brexit.Authority lackingThe prime minister said she would seek to ratify the Brexit deal and pass the necessary implementation legislation in time for Britain to avoid contesting European Parliament elections on May 23rd.But neither May nor Corbyn command enough authority over their MPs to guarantee that a deal they both endorsed would win a majority in the House of Commons. For now, neither the hard Brexiteers on the Conservative benches nor the ardent advocates of a second referendum on the benches opposite see any incentive to soften their positions. And the six-month extension agreed in Brussels will do nothing to change that."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3857576.1555009125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may rejects resignation call from tory brexiteers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTory Brexiteer Bill Cash speaking on Thusday in the House of Commons, where he suggested prime minister Theresa May should resign. Photograph: UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May has dismissed calls from Conservative Brexiteers for her resignation after she agreed a six-month delay to Brexit with European Union leaders early on Thursday morning. Mrs May told MPs that she would continue to seek a compromise with Labour that could command a majority in the House of Commons.She and Jeremy Corbyn met briefly on Thursday and agreed to continue talks “in an effort to\u0026nbspmake substantive progress” towards finding a compromise plan for Brexit.“This is not the normal way of British politics – and it is uncomfortable for many in both the government and opposition parties.\u0026nbspReaching an agreement will not be easy, because to be successful it will require both sides to make compromises,” said Mrs May.“But however challenging it may be politically, I profoundly believe that in this unique situation where the House is deadlocked, it is incumbent on both front benches to seek to work together to deliver what the British people voted for.”No-deal departure Veteran Eurosceptics Bill Cash and Peter Bone suggested that Mrs May should resign because the extension until October 31st contradicted a promise she made in the House last month not to agree any extension beyond June 30th. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the prime minister should learn the lessons from this week’s summit, which he claimed marked the EU backing down before the threat of a no-deal Brexit.“Will she please examine where she is going with all this, learn the lessons, and come back with something that can actually secure a majority in the House?” he said.Mrs May had a sharp exchange with DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson, becoming visibly angry when he asked if she could give any example of an EU demand she had resisted. She said one of the demands she had resisted was for a Northern Ireland-only backstop.MPs left Westminster on Thursday night until after Easter, when the government is expected to make a final effort to win approval for the Brexit deal in time to avoid contesting European Parliament elections on May 23rd.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

However last month The  reported that British Overseas Territories  (BOT’s) could be forced to recognise gay marriages following multiple legal battles by one couple which resulted in a landmark ruling.Chantelle Day, 32, and her fiancee Vickie Bodden Bush, 44, have been in a relationship since 2012. The couple, who are parents to a young daughter, were denied the right to marry because they lived in the Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory but last month they finally won their case which was hailed as a “victory for equality”.However it has since emerged that same-sex couples will now ahve to wait a few months longer to discover if they still have the right to marry after the case was sent to the Court of Appeal.The Court of Appeal agreed on Wednesday afternoon to delay implementation of last month’s historic judgment legalising same-sex marriage.The Cayman Islands Government is currently appealing Chief Justice Anthony Smellie’s decision to legalise same-sex marriage and has applied for a stay to block gay and lesbian couples from getting married until the conclusion of that appeal.Cayman Compass, a local newspaper, reported that a mixed crowd of friends and family of the two women and opponents of same-sex marriage had packed the public gallery as the decision was announced.“Praise the lord, thank you, Jesus,” one woman shouted at the conclusion of the case. “Bigots,” another member of the gallery shouted in response. A small group also sang religious songs outside the court in apparent celebration of the decision.Ms Day, a solicitor who is the daughter of a Caymanian mother and British father and Ms Bodden Bush, who is a British nurse and who resides in the Cayman Islands on a work permit, were refused a marriage licence in April last year. The couple had planned to celebrate their marriage with a beach wedding this spring.She told The : “The reaction and lack of leadership from the Cayman Islands Government on this matter of basic human rights has been nothing short of appalling. The types of homophobic abuse that Vickie, I and the rest of the LGBTQ+ community have been subjected to by the elected officials has been shocking and would never happen in any other advanced democratic society.  It’s even more disappointing that the UK stands by and allows this iniquity to continue when they have the power to remedy this instantly. Jonathan Cooper OBE, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers who originally advised the couple, called on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to bear the responsibility for the case.“Cayman is a British Overseas Territory, Caymanians are UK citizens,” he said. “The Foreign Secretary is responsible for good government in the Cayman. When Boris Johnson was Foreign Secretary he chose not to insist on the extension of marriage, or at least civil partnerships, to the Cayman Islands. Instead he forced Chantelle and Vickie to litigate to establish their right to marry.“We look now to Jeremy Hunt as Foreign Secretary to offer the leadership on LGBT equality, as well as compassion, that Boris Johnson lacked. Jeremy Hunt needs to stand firm and ensure that Chantelle and Vickie’s ordeal is over.“The FCO needs to fight for their right to marry. FCO lawyers should have been in court arguing alongside Chantelle and Vickie’s lawyer that the right to marry for same sex couples must not be suspended.”An FCO spokesman said: “The court judgment permitting same–sex marriage in the Cayman Islands puts the territory among the most progressive societies in the region in terms of LGBT equality.“The UK Government is committed to equal rights, including LGBT rights, and welcomes the judgment. We are therefore disappointed by the decision of the Cayman Islands Government to appeal.”Court of AppealTaxpayers\u0026#39 face £109m bill for \u0026#39non-event European electionsTheresa May accused

stone steps associated christs crucifixion uncovered","story":"Catholic devotees climbed the newly restored staircase on their knees in a traditional act of penitence and devotionVatican City and Holy SeeA sacred staircase which Christ is said to have climbed to be sentenced to crucifixion by Pontius Pilate has been restored to its original state after nearly 300 years.The 28 steps of the Scala Santa, or Holy Staircase, are believed to have been brought from Jerusalem to Rome in the fourth century AD by Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, who adopted Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.The marble staircase had been encased in wood since 1723, when the pope of the time, Innocent XIII, decided that it could no longer stand the wear and tear of millions of pilgrims, who by tradition must crawl up it on their hands and knees to earn indulgences.During a long restoration, the wooden planks were removed and the intricate 16th century frescoes on the walls and ceiling above the staircase cleaned and returned to their original lustre.Restorers found inscriptions and graffiti scratched into the frescoes, including a message of thanks by one Italian man who had escaped being held as a slave by the Turks.Catholic faithful clamber up the Holy Staircase on their knees after its restorationThe staircase was blessed by a cardinal, Angelo De Donatis, Vicar General of the diocese of Rome, after which crowds of Catholic faithful got down on their knees and inched their way up the deeply-worn marble stairway.In some places, the steps are worn down to a depth of 15 centimetres, testament to the generations of Catholics who have laboured their way up to the top.The restoration of the monument, located close to one of Rome’s great basilicas, St John in Lateran, was carried out by experts from the Vatican Museums.They found hundreds of crumpled notes stuffed down cracks in the timber boards, carrying prayers or appeals for ine intervention in illnesses and family tragedies.“We found them step by step as we removed the floorboards – many, many little notes and coins, left as offerings,” said Paolo Violini, the coordinator of the restoration.“The steps are made of many different kinds of marble and cleaning them revealed their beauty.”The Holy Staircase is located close to one of Rome\u0026#39s great basilicas, St John in LateranThe most significant discoveries were three ancient crosses, one made of bronze and the others of red porphyry stone, which mark the place where, according to legend, drops of Christ’s blood fell as he was led up the staircase.Pilgrims kissed the crosses as they made their way up the steps, their feet encased in blue plastic covers to protect the marble.The steps lead to a chapel called the Sancta Sanctorum, or Holy of Holies, so named for the many precious relics kept there. It was once the private chapel of popes.“This is the first time in nearly 300 years that the steps have been exposed,” said Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums.A Catholic cardinal blesses the restored Holy Stairs (Scala Santa), which according to Catholic Church tradition is the staircase which Christ climbed on his way to being condemned to death  “If you close your eyes for a moment, you can imagine yourself back in the medieval era, the last time that people scaled these steps on their knees,” said Guido Cornini, a curator from the museums.The exposed steps will remain open to the public for 60 days, covering the whole Easter period.The “extraordinary opening” will end on June 9, after which they will be covered up again.The restoration of the steps was funded by a charitable organisation called the Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums, with donors including a British-Australian businessman and philanthropist, Sir Michael Hintze, and his wife, Lady Dorothy Hintze.Vatican City and Holy SeePlease review our commenting policyTaxpayers\u0026#39 face £109m bill for \u0026#39non-event European electionsTheresa May accused of \u0026#39frittering away\u0026#39 £109 million bill on \u0026#39charade\u0026#39 of  EU electionsUK has sought assurances that Julian Assange will not face death penalty as Labour defends Wikileaks founder and criticises extraditionLess than 12 hours after Brussels showdown, Theresa May laughs off demands to resign by exasperated MPsWhy the new Royal baby will be an Earl or Lady rather than a Prince or PrincessGovernment says it is \u0026#34disappointed\u0026#34 as Cayman Islands rejects gay marriageNicola Sturgeon says she will set out her views on indyref2 shortly, while demanding a new vote on BrexitPrimary school will give pupils Friday afternoons off as children \u0026#39lack focus\u0026#39 by end of weekUS states push ahead with near-bans on abortion for Supreme court challengeComment: Feeble Tory MPs look powerless to remove Theresa MayComment: The pampered life of a British MEP is about to get even cushierSpain\u0026#39s election campaign to launch amid accusations of \u0026#39Watergate\u0026#39-style  espionageGeoffrey Cox says ministers will \u0026#39listen\u0026#39 to demands for second Brexit referendumAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison calls general election eight months into termComment: Nothing stirs the spirit like the nostalgic glamour of travelling by steamBritish woman found dead in Swiss hotel room as German boyfriend arrestedNetanyahu operatives boast of driving down Arab turnout with hidden camerasJack Shepherd to spend extra six months in prison as judge tells him bid to evade justice was \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39Flock of unruly geese causing havoc in Salisbury as residents say their village is \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/17/16/asos.jpg","title":"asos profits plummet 87 after difficult year","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We are confident of an improved performance in the second half and are not changing our guidance for the year.“We are nearing the end of a major capex (capital expenditure) programme.“Whilst this has inevitably involved significant disruption and transition costs, the global capability it now provides us gives us increased confidence in our ability to continue to capture market share whilst restoring profitability and accelerating free cash flow generation.”In December, the company warned that profits were likely to be lower than expected due to a significant deterioration in trading during the lead-up to Christmas.The announcement indicated that the company was not immune from the cyclical slowdown, caused in part by the disruptive effect of Black Friday on the usual retail calendar.Shares were up nearly 15\u0026nbspper cent\u0026nbspin morning trading at 3,600p.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The actors who portray these characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany – are all expected to appear.Before that, though, there’s the small matter of Avengers: Endgame, which will be released in UK cinemas on 25 April.\u0026nbspYou can find a countdown of every single film in the MCU – from worst to best – below.Created with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

It remained there until 1925, when it moved to Dessau.The school\u0027s final location was Berlin, where it moved in 1932 and remained opened only until 1933.\u0026nbsp2. Its goal was to bridge the gap between art and technical craftThe Bauhaus began as the merger of two existing institutions: the\u0026nbspWeimar Academy of Arts and the Weimar School of Arts and Crafts, according to the\u0026nbspEncyclopaedia Britannica.One of the main goals was to erase the distinction between applied arts and fine arts, by teaching students to combine practicality and artful meaning.3.\u0026nbspSome of its lesser known trailblazers are female artistsPainters Paul Klee\u0026nbspand Wassily Kandkinsky, sculptor and designer\u0026nbspOskar Schlemmer, and painter and photographer\u0026nbspLászló Moholy-Nagy\u0026nbspare among the best known members of the Bauhaus school.But female artists also made valuable, groundbreaking contributions, although their names are not cited as often.Industrial designer Marianne Brandt, weavers\u0026nbspGunta Stölzl\u0026nbspand Benita Koch-Otte​, textile artist Otti\u0026nbspBerger, and designer\u0026nbspAlma Siedhoff-Buscher​ are among the many women who wrote part of the Bauhaus\u0027s history.4. The Nazi regime forced the Bauhaus to shut downThe Bauhaus school, then based in Berlin, officially dissolved in April 1933 under pressure from the Nazis.It had previously been forced out of Dessau after the Nazis had become the dominant political force in the city.5. The Bauhaus\u0027s influence can still be felt across the world todayWhile the school closed down in the 1930s, its curriculum kept being taught in arts school around the world.Moholy-Nagy\u0026nbspnotably created the New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1937. The school, which remains open, has since been renamed the\u0026nbspIIT Institute of Design.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, her expertise is in computer algorithms, and the work she did was to help turn the data received by astronomers into a useful picture, rather than collecting that data in the first place.Everything you need to know about the black hole photoThe now famous picture of the black hole was generated by scientists who turned a series of dishes around the world to point together deep into space, creating one huge virtual telescope. All of the vast amount of data that process produced then had to be sorted through to understand what exactly it showed – and it was an algorithm written by Dr Bouman that helped turn that messy data into something visible.Her work began three years ago, when she was a graduate student at\u0026nbspthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She led the project alongside a team from\u0026nbspMIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics and the MIT Haystack Observatory.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

She noted that such a feat could be possible within a couple of years\u0026nbsp– which, it turned out, it was.The breakthrough led to her being hailed on social media, and her name was quickly trending. She received callouts from celebrities including Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who tweeted about her achievement.“Take your rightful seat in history, Dr. Bouman!” she wrote. “Congratulations and thank you for your enormous contribution to the advancements of science and mankind. Here’s to #WomenInSTEM!”Dr Bouman has stressed that the work that allowed the image to be created was the result of co-operation between a whole host of researchers.“No one of us could’ve done it alone,” Bouman told CNN. “It came together because of lots of different people from many backgrounds.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But until now, we have not been able to see them because they drag in light.“We have seen what we thought was unseeable,” said\u0026nbspSheperd\u0026nbspDoeleman\u0026nbspof Harvard. “We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole.”Jessica Dempsey, a co-discoverer from\u0026nbspthe East Asian Observatory in Hawaii, said that when she first saw the image, taken two years ago, it reminded her of the powerful flaming Eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings.\u0026nbspEHT Collaboration)Unlike smaller black holes that come from collapsed stars, supermassive black holes are mysterious in origin.

The new\u0026nbspimage, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, adds light to that sound.How black hole photo could change our understanding of the universeOutside scientists suggested the achievement could be worthy of a Nobel Prize, just as the gravitational wave discovery was.\u0026nbspWhile much\u0026nbspof what surrounds\u0026nbspa black hole falls into a death spiral and is never to be seen again, the new image captures “lucky gas and dust” circling at just far enough to be safe and seen millions of years later on Earth, Dempsey said.\u0026nbspTaken over four days when astronomers had “to have the perfect weather all across the world and literally all the stars had to align”, the image helps confirm Einstein’s general relativity theory, Dempsey said. Einstein a century ago even predicted the symmetrical shape that scientists just found, she said.\u0026nbsp“It’s circular, but on one side the light is brighter,” Dempsey said. That’s because that light is approaching Earth.\u0026nbspThe measurements are taken at a wavelength the human eye cannot see, so the astronomers added colour to the image. They chose “exquisite gold because this light is so hot”, Dempsey said. “Making it these warm gold and oranges makes sense.”\u0026nbspWhat the image shows is gas heated to millions of degrees by the friction of ever-stronger gravity, scientists said. And that gravity creates an\u0026nbspeffect where you see light from both behind the black hole and behind you as the light curves and circles around the black hole itself, said astronomer Avi Loeb, director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard.The project cost around £40m, with half\u0026nbspof that coming from the US\u0026nbspNational Science Foundation.Astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac,\u0026nbspof Johns Hopkins University in Maryland in the US, pronounced the image “an amazing technical achievement” that “gives us a glimpse of gravity in its most extreme manifestation.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Pictures from computer simulations can be very pretty, but there’s literally nothing like a picture of the real universe, however fuzzy and monochromatic.”\u0026nbsp“It’s just seriously cool,” said John Kormendy, a University of Texas astronomer. “To see the stuff going down the tubes so to speak, to see it firsthand. The mystique of black holes in the community is very substantial. That mystique is going to be made more real.”\u0026nbspThere is a myth that says a black hole would rip you apart, but Loeb and Kormendy said the one pictured is so big, someone could fall into it and not be ripped apart.Black holes are “like the walls of a prison” said Loeb. “Once you cross it, you will never be able to get out and you will never be able to communicate.”The first image is of a black hole in a galaxy called M87 that is about 53 million light years from Earth. One light year is 5.9 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometres. This black hole is about 6 billion times the mass of our sun.\u0026nbspThe telescope data was gathered by the Event Horizon Telescope two years ago. Completing the image\u0026nbspinvolved\u0026nbspabout 200 scientists, supercomputers and hundreds of terabytes of data delivered worldwide by plane.\u0026nbspThe team looked at two supermassive black holes, the M87 and the one at the centre of the Milky Way. The one in our galaxy is closer but much smaller, so they both look the same size in the sky. But the more distant one was easier to take pictures of because it rotates more slowly, Dempsey said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been hunting this for a long time,” Dempsey said. “We’ve been getting closer and closer with better technology.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No wonder people are reluctant to switch, even if that means paying more\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentEnergy regulator OfGem has introduced new rules in a bid to reduce the number of failing energy firms The importance of OfGem introducing financial health tests for would be energy suppliers can be seen by clicking on another headline on its website concerning its appointment of SSE, a member of the big six energy firms, to take on customers of the collapsed Brilliant Energy.\u0026nbspFar too many new entrants have ended up in a similarly unhappy place, making victims of their customers who have sometimes been left facing an administrative nightmare, or worse.\u0026nbspMillions of Britons are paying more than they need to for their energy, even after the introduction of OfGem\u0027s price cap. That will only be addressed if they are willing to switch.\u0026nbspEnergy bills to rise for millions across UK as Ofgem hikes price capNew energy rules could save households £45 a year, Ofgem saysExtra Energy becomes sixth UK supplier to go bust this yearThe collapse of firms like Brilliant Energy - and there have been 11 such failures over the past six moths - has acted\u0026nbspas a powerful disincentive towards their\u0026nbspdoing that.\u0026nbspThe new rules, which come into force in June, are designed to address the problem. They will require firms to prove that they can fund their operations adequately for the first year. They will have to pass a fit and proper test, focussing on their mangers and owners. And they will have to prove that they can meet commitments to customer service.\u0026nbspThe regulations may serve to discourage some perfectly capable firms from taking the plunge\u0026nbspbecause regulations often do that, even when they are perfectly sensible (as these are).\u0026nbspBut the cost will ultimately be outweighed by the benefits if the requirements\u0026nbspserve to reduce the disturbing number of failures we have witnessed. That has to be the regulator’s chief concern. \u0026nbspThe irony of OfGem selecting SSE to pick up the pieces after the collapse of Brilliant Energy is rich. It is a member of the big six. It was hoped that new entrants like Brilliant would serve to reduce the dominance they have had over the market and lead to lower prices for consumers. The sheer number of failures\u0026nbsphave ended up pushing them their way, and not just through their picking up the pieces.\u0026nbspPeople with SSE and its peers (British Gas, EDF Energy, E.on, Scottish Power, Npower) may very well\u0026nbspfeel that it’s a case of better the devil you know even if it means paying more. Recent events will have strengthened that feeling.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The Pensions Regulator thinks that up to £6bn may be needed to plug it.\u0026nbspThe government wants the rail companies to pony up, and there’s a certain logic to its position. If you’re running a privatised industry you should take on the risks inherent in doing so. \u0026nbspThe rail companies, whose model has long been based on having their cake and eating it, disagree. There is a certain logic to their position too. They point out that they can’t possibly hope to manage long term financial risks over which they have no control while running (relatively) short term franchises.\u0026nbspThe debate is both complex and technical, as they often are when it comes to pensions, and none of those involved in it are entirely in the right, including the regulator.\u0026nbspIt’s much less important than the fact that it once again brutally exposes the flaws inherent in the rail franchising system, a dead horse that successive governments have been flogging for far too long.\u0026nbspThere are two ways you can attack that issue, which is currently the subject of an independent review being led by Keith Williams. You can institute\u0026nbspreforms that\u0026nbspkeep\u0026nbspprivatisation more or less intact and hope the system works better under them. This what people like Stagecoach boss Martin Griffiths would like to see happen.\u0026nbspAlternatively, you could simply accept that privatising the real industry was a mistake that has\u0026nbspfailed passengers, workers and taxpayers, and scrap it.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The format could do with a tweak“Job done,” said Tesco boss Dave Lewis as he unveiled a bravura set results.\u0026nbspActually he said this: “After four years we have met or are about to meet the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I\u0027m very confident that we will complete the journey in 201920.”\u0026nbspYou get my drift, though.\u0026nbspTesco begins plastic-free trial for selection of fruit and vegetablesTesco to axe 9,000 jobs and cut hours in cost-saving planHooray, said he City of London, and no wonder. The key numbers are nearly all heading in the right direction. Pre tax profits were up 28 per cent, the idend almost doubled. Expectations were high in the run up, but Lewis beat them all the same.\u0026nbspIt is\u0026nbspworth noting that UK sales growth slipped in the second half of the year, and the overseas businesses continue to struggle. Quibbles? Yes but\u0026nbspimportant ones.\u0026nbspNonetheless,\u0026nbspthe state of the business when Lewis took over shouldn\u0027t be forgotten. The grocer\u0026nbspwas reeling from the scandal of a £250m black hole in its accounts and looked clueless,\u0026nbspnot just in the face of the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl but even that of Sainsbury’s for goodness sake. About the only innovation of note under Clarke’s regime was the Hudl, a now discontinued Tesco tablet.\u0026nbspWith Lewis having cut his teeth at Unilever, a supplier rather than a retailer, questions were\u0026nbspraised about whether he was the right man to turn the ship around. The doubters have\u0026nbspfallen silent.This is a retailer that knows what it’s about again. So do its customers. It’s delivering what they want, mostly, and looks better placed to cope with the Conservative government’s attempts to rip the country apart than some of its rivals even if Lewis\u0027 cost cutting plans, and the closure of fresh food counters, aren\u0027t\u0026nbspto everyone\u0027s taste.\u0026nbspHe\u0027s even having a go at discounting, moving his tanks on to the lawn of the German pair with the\u0026nbsp‘Jack’s’ format. Lewis\u0026nbspsays the response to it has been good. But I doubt Aldi and Liddl\u0027s bosses are\u0026nbspoverly worried. The nationalistic branding and 1950s chic suggest the format could handle a tweak.\u0026nbspStill, no one’s going to crucify diamond Dave for playing with ideas now he’s got the core business firing on all cylinders.\u0026nbspHe’s earned that right and he’s earned the right to pat himself on the back and to receive one from the City.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They just needed pointing in the right direction, which Lewis has done. Nor is he standing still as Tesco moves into its next phase under his stewardship. \u0026nbspBut the City and the financial media should be wary of lionising their crown prince.\u0026nbspThat was what happened with another former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, the man who built the “supermarket that ate Britain”. The tail end of his tenure doesn\u0027t look so good in retrospect. He wasn\u0027t responsible from the misrule of Philip Clarke that Lewis has put right.

We are confident of an improved performance in the second half and are not changing our guidance for the year.“We are nearing the end of a major capex (capital expenditure) programme.“Whilst this has inevitably involved significant disruption and transition costs, the global capability it now provides us gives us increased confidence in our ability to continue to capture market share whilst restoring profitability and accelerating free cash flow generation.”In December, the company warned that profits were likely to be lower than expected due to a significant deterioration in trading during the lead-up to Christmas.The announcement indicated that the company was not immune from the cyclical slowdown, caused in part by the disruptive effect of Black Friday on the usual retail calendar.Shares were up nearly 15\u0026nbspper cent\u0026nbspin morning trading at 3,600p.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This will help minimise the risk of supplier failure and help drive up standards for consumers.“We will adopt a proportionate, risk-based approach to licensing suppliers and will continue to encourage competition and innovation, including innovative business models, which benefits consumers.”gas and electricityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will be the first time that a moon lander has come from a country that wasn\u0027t China, Russia or the US, and it will also mark the first time that such a mission has been completed by a private company rather than a public space agency.When it does, and lands on its four legs, it will get to work with the on-board\u0026nbspmagnetometer it is carrying to examine the moon\u0027s magnetic field. It is also carrying a reflector that will be able to bounce lasers back to the Earth, allowing for more detailed calcuations of how far away the Moon is.It will only do its work for two days. After that, with no thermal control, the lander will heat up in the sun and die.Created with Sketch.Israel launches SpaceX rocket: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Video grab from the live transmission of the launchA long exposure photograph of the launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchVideo grab from the live transmission of the launchA long exposure photograph of the launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with Israel\u0027s Lunar Lander and an Indonesian communications satellite at space launch complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, FloridaA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is prepped for launchIt will leave behind the vast time capsule it took with it, stored digitally.

One hundred years on, families say the wounds still have not healed. Adam Withnall reports from AmritsarClick to followThe IndependentA painting of the Amritsar massacre, an event that became a landmark on India’s road to independenceThe walled garden at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar is unrecognisable today from the spring of 1919, when it became the scene of the single bloodiest act of violent oppression in Britain’s colonial occupation.\u0026nbspOn 13 April\u0026nbspIndia will mark the 100th anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of unarmed men, women and children by British soldiers who had been sent to quash what was believed to be a mounting rebellion.Many myths and misconceptions now surround the events that unfolded in April 1919, but the sheer scale of the brutality involved has seen the Jallianwala Bagh massacre become infamous in India as an essential landmark on the country’s path to independence.Pressure has mounted in recent months on the current British government to take the centenary as an opportunity to issue an historic apology. For the families of those killed, who say they have been suffering the consequences of the massacre for 100 years, it could finally offer some closure.\u0026nbspIt is impossible to say precisely how many people were killed in the garden on 13 April 1919. The official British toll from the time was 379, but a new, definitive count by Amritsar’s Partition Museum has come up with 501 named victims, plus an indeterminate number whose names may never be known.Britain is also to blame for the century-long controversy of AmritsarBetween 10,000 and 20,000 people had gathered in the park to attend a political meeting staged by local leaders, angry at a recent crackdown on dissent by British officials, for whom Amritsar was a key administrative centre.\u0026nbspThree days earlier, on 10 April, riots had broken out across the city during which five Europeans were killed and an influential British schoolteacher was assaulted in the street. Control of the city was handed over to the army and General Reginald Dyer was tasked with enforcing a ban on public assembly.When the meeting in Jallianwala Bagh was called the night before, organisers knew they might face trouble, and some told their wives to stay at home.Sunil Kapoor holds a portrait of his great-grandfather Lala Wasoo Mal, who was killed at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Nonetheless, at 4pm on 13 April the crowd included “a lot of people who didn’t know exactly what the meeting was, so weren’t necessarily politically involved”, says Dr Kim Wagner, a senior lecturer in British Imperial History at Queen Mary University London and author of Amritsar 1919:\u0026nbspAn Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre. “There were also children playing in the picnic area and there were pilgrims who happened to be in that space, which is right next to the Golden Temple,” he adds, referring to Amritsar’s most famous landmark for Sikh devotees.It was then that the general and his soldiers walked into the garden armed with rifles. At a later inquiry, Dyer said he would have brought in a machine gun too if it had fit in through the narrow gatesIf Britain apologised and extended its welcome to the families, which have been suffering for 100 years, that would start to make for better relationsJust 30 seconds elapsed from the army’s arrival to the first rounds being fired. The guns did not fall silent for more than 10 minutes, after which 1,650\u0026nbsprounds had been shot and, in addition to those killed, more than 1,500 people were wounded.Sunil Kapoor, 42, describes this as the moment that changed his family forever. Sitting in his home in the cramped streets of downtown Amritsar, he proudly displays a portrait of his great-grandfather Lala Wasoo Mal, one of the organisers of the Jallianwala Bagh meeting and one of the first victims whose identity was confirmed by the British at the time.Kapoor’s ancestor was then aged 45 and a successful merchant, making him an influential figure in the community. He was at a smaller gathering on 12 April that preceded the Jallianwala Bagh event and helped raise 1,200 rupees – a large figure at the time – for the political cause.At around 7pm, when Mal did not return home from the park, his six-months-pregnant wife Puram went to try and find him, Kapoor says.\u0026nbsp“She was only 21 at the time. She arrived at the scene to see blood and bodies everywhere, everyone was screaming. It took her more than one hour just to find her husband.”Jaswinder ‘Jassy‘ Singh has been a tour guide at the memorial garden for nine years. He says he receives many British clients, some of whom cry when they see the site (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Mal was gravely hurt, after receiving two gunshot wounds to the chest. Puram stayed by his side through the night until Rotary Club volunteers took him to hospital in the morning but, with no doctors or nurses available and no hope of emergency surgery, he died six days later.\u0026nbspPuram was too young to take on her husband’s businesses so they had to close, and she was forced to live off the family’s savings while raising Kapoor’s grandfather.“The massacre changed her,” he says. “She had to become an iron lady, to be strong for her son. And she became inspired afterwards\u0026nbspto work for the end of British rule. It was her tribute to my great-grandfather.”Puram gave evidence at the Hunter Commission, a British inquiry into the shooting that criticised some aspects of the massacre but which was overall considered a whitewash. Kapoor says she appeared at the inquiry in Lahore and told Dyer to his face that he “must pay for the sins of what he has done”. Dyer, who had not learned the local language, did not understand, Kapoor says.Kapoor met David Cameron when the then-prime minister visited Amritsar in 2013 and expressed “deep regret” for the massacre. He speaks positively of how though Cameron “could not openly apologise, his body language showed how he felt it in his soul”.Kapoor, who also heads a small foundation for the families of those killed at Jallianwala Bagh, says the centenary is a “good time” for Britain to finally deliver a full apology. And in lieu of compensation for the families, he would like to see them invited to address the British parliament in order to tell their stories and receive some form of honour on behalf of their ancestors.Amritsar after the riots\u0026nbsp(Alamy)“If Britain apologised and extended its welcome to the families, which have been suffering for 100 years, that would start to make for better relations,” he says.\u0026nbspJaswinder Singh, a tour guide who has been working at what is now the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial for nine years, stands at the spot from which the soldiers had surveyed the crowd and then started shooting.People were here for a protest. General Dyer came here with soldiers, waited for people to gather and then ordered the soldiers to fire. Many people died. The sacrifice they made here gave a spark to the minds of Indians who wanted independenceHe says many of those he shows round are amazed there hasn’t already been an apology. “I have many European clients, a lot of them British. When I bring citizens of the UK here they feel so sorry, sometimes they start crying,” he saysBritain’s official stance, reiterated in a House of Lords debate in February and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office this week, is that the government at the time condemned the massacre and that the matter has been dealt with.\u0026nbsp“Visitors expect that it must already have happened,” Singh says. “They feel that if just saying sorry can help heal the wounds here then why not just do it.” He says that if an apology were to be issued, “it would mean a lot\u0026nbspfor the whole nation”.The park was some five feet lower in 1919, and the soldiers stood on an embankment as they started firing. Now, the whole site has been raised to a uniform level, with a 1960s-installed obelisk dominating the view.\u0026nbspTourists walk the hedge-lined paths among ornate flower beds and crude topiary figures of riflemen, shading under large red stone structures none of which existed at the time of the shooting.Jallianwala Bagh memorial park is now full of tourists, as the city gears up for events to mark the centenary (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Families with selfie sticks pose for photographs next to the gaudy, pink-roofed “Martyrs’ Well”, from which legend has it 120 bodies were pulled after the massacre ended. There is no historical evidence to support this claim, but it is still repeated on a placard in four languages.The most historically significant points in the park are three walls where the brickwork is still pocked by bullet marks from the British rifles. Though highlighted by white boxes, these too have deteriorated to become almost indistinguishable, worn down by curious fingers tracing the path of the bullets. A glass barrier keeping tourists at a distance was installed a couple of years ago.“People don’t always value this place,” bemoans Singh. “For some it is a serious place but for many it is just another tourist spot. They just come here to take selfies.”British Government refuses to apologise over 1919 Amritsar massacreSadiq Khan calls on Government to apologise for colonial massacreBritish government ‘covered up’ its role in Amritsar massacre in IndiaEfforts are being made to spruce up the site which, on the day of the centenary itself, will host a special event featuring the vice-president of India. Visitor numbers are also up, with tourists from across the country thronging through the small front gate. Vishwas Sini, 22, is visiting with his cousin from Haryana. Even before touring the site, he is aware of the basic history after studying the massacre at school – he, like many here, repeats the story of the “many bodies pulled from the well”.Naresh Parikh, 72, is visiting with his family from Gujarat. “This was a terrible act that happened here,” he says. “The British\u0026nbspgeneral stood here and killed thousands of people.”WithnallThe Independent)Gurjeet Singh, 18, is a relatively local tourist from within Punjab state. Nonetheless, he admits he knows “very little” about the incident. “Gen Dyer killed around 100 people and some people died in the well. That’s all I know,” he says.\u0026nbspTheir comments, and those of others like them, display what Wagner describes as the most persistent myth surrounding the massacre, that it was all the act of one man – the “bad apple narrative”, as he calls it, exonerating the wider system of which Gen Dyer was a part.Created with Sketch.Holi 2019 in pictures: Hindus celebrate Indian Festival of Colours Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hindu devotees raise their hands in prayer as they are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA girl smears her friend in colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India College girls pose during Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A college girl takes part in the Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A young girl smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India Colour fills the air during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India An Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaA vendor sells coloured powder known as gulal prior to Holi celebrations in Siliguru, IndiaAn Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaA hindu priest is smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India A student is covered in colour on a campus in Chandigarh, IndiaColour is sprayed from a temple during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaStudents smeared in colour dance during Holi celebrations in Chandigarh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA young man is smeared in colour by his friend during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaWomen play with powdered colours Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees raise their hands in prayer as they are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA girl smears her friend in colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India College girls pose during Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A college girl takes part in the Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A young girl smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India Colour fills the air during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India An Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaA vendor sells coloured powder known as gulal prior to Holi celebrations in Siliguru, IndiaAn Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaA hindu priest is smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India A student is covered in colour on a campus in Chandigarh, IndiaColour is sprayed from a temple during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaStudents smeared in colour dance during Holi celebrations in Chandigarh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA young man is smeared in colour by his friend during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaWomen play with powdered colours Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India“If you do not accept that General Dyer was a one-off – and the same pernicious logic was displayed by countless other officers over the course of the empire’s history – then it rocks the entire system upon which the British rule operated.”If the park today has its shortcomings from the perspective of historical accuracy, efforts have been made to rectify the situation in the lead-up to the centenary.WithnallThe Independent)A special exhibition has been curated at the nearby Partition Museum in the city, which provides a timeline showing how the riots in the days leading up to 13 April 1919 set the stage for the massacre and, perhaps most crucially, how the bloodshed was followed by an even more restrictive period of martial law.These martial law orders, given by Gen Dyer himself, banned activities including riding a bicycle and walking down the street in groups of four or more. Those who breached the orders were stripped naked and publicly flogged.The exhibition highlights newspaper clippings from the time, including the first bulletin about the massacre that ran in Britain’s Civil and Military Gazette on the 16 April as follows: “As the crowd refused to go the order to fire was given. There were heavy casualties amongst the mob, several hundreds being killed and injured, and there was no further trouble.Instead of shying away from it, the British government should make clear that this is not the same Britain as it was 100 years ago. There is a deep, festering wound here. It is worth putting some closure on itMore importantly, the exhibition defines the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as “not an isolated event but part of a larger system of colonial oppression”.Kishwar Desai, the museum’s chair, said that the work to produce the exhibition had inspired her to write a book on the massacre last year. She said the digital materials were being shared for exhibits in Manchester, Birmingham and London as part of events around the centenary.“This was a turning point in our history,” she says. “Even Gandhi himself, who was a fan of the British up to that point –\u0026nbsponce the truth began to come out about what happened that day and in the aftermath, it became very difficult for him to continue to believe in the fairness of the British.”She says it could be considered the single worst atrocity of the Raj. “The more I researched the accounts of it, the more heartbroken I became,” she says.\u0026nbsp“These were people who had fought the war for the British, who had died for the British. And even after the massacre they are not given medical help, they are called rabid. How could they be so cruel?”Jallianwala Bagh memorial garden, the first British prime minister to do so (PA)Desai says that, other than the centenary itself, there “can be no other moment” for an apology after so many years.\u0026nbsp“I feel an apology is important – it is not for us. It is for those who died,” she says. “For me their spirit is still alive, and it is their spirit that has carried us through to where we are today.“Instead of shying away from it, they should make clear that this is not the same Britain as it was 100 years ago. There is a deep, festering wound here. It is worth putting some closure on it.”British government officials were due to address the centenary this week during\u0026nbspdebates at Westminster Hall\u0026nbspand at prime minister’s questions, but British representatives are not expected to attend any of the key anniversary events planned for Saturday.\u0026nbspSpeaking during the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday, Foreign Office minister Mark Field said he had been to India three times in the past 18 months and that he had listened to the\u0026nbsp”very, very compelling” speeches in favour of an apology.Nonetheless, he said that it was\u0026nbsp”not appropriate for me today to make the apology that I know many would wish to come”, going on to say that the government had concerns about the “financial implications” of apologising.\u0026nbspWhile the government had previously raised hopes by suggesting it was “reflecting” on the matter of an apology, it is now\u0026nbspthought unlikely that any statements will\u0026nbspdeviate far from the UK’s previous official stances.Field said Britain’s envoy to India would at some point travel to lay a wreath at the Jallianwala Bagh\u0026nbspmemorial. “It is right that we mark the centenary of this tragic event in Amritsar in the most appropriate way and that we never forget what happened,” he said. “It was a shameful episode in our history and one that we deeply regret to this day.”​Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year’s annual college draft was televised on three US networks and drew record ratings for them, averaging an impressive 5.5 million viewers over the three days of the event. The all important first round that ran in prime time on a Thursday night drew 11.2 million.\u0026nbspNow compare that to game six of the Boston Celtics – Milwaukee Bucks NBA playoff series, featuring actual competition involving actual players with something at stake. Going head to head with the draft, it drew just 2.4 million.\u0026nbspThe NBA finals in June managed 18.5 million, a mite disappointing but unsurprising given the one-sided nature of the series (the Golden State Warriors swept LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers). But still.\u0026nbspThe draft’s ratings were also comfortably ahead of the NHL’s Stanley Cup Finals, although ice hockey ranks a distant fourth in terms of the popularity of America’s major sports.\u0026nbspNow consider what the 11.2 million\u0026nbspdraft fans were actually watching when they tuned in. \u0026nbspEach of teams involved in the first round gets fully 15 minutes to make their\u0026nbspselections, which means the event can, and does, take hours to complete. It’s 10\u0026nbspminutes for rounds two and three on Friday, and five minutes for the four later rounds on Saturday.\u0026nbspThe announcement of each pick – the “action”\u0026nbsp– is over in a matter of seconds.\u0026nbspMajor League Baseball is in a funk over the pace of the game, with the ball actually in play for maybe 15 minutes over the course of more than three hours. It’s imposing rule changes in an attempt to speed things up, fearing millennials will switch off the game if it doesn’t.\u0026nbspBut compared to the NFL Draft even its most drawn-out contents look like the Olympic 100m\u0026nbspfinal.\u0026nbspHow has this happened? Why do so many American\u0026nbspsports fans, and not a few Britons, and other international NFL obsessives such as myself, spend so much time watching an event made up chiefly of lots and lots of dead space?“It’s driven by hope,” says Peter O’Reilly, the senior vice president of events at the NFL, who has been with the league for 13 years, playing a key role in making the event what it is today.“We have such parity in the NFL. OK the Patriots have been very successful, but you have so many examples of teams being rebuilt through the draft. No one wins or loses on draft day itself so everyone feels a connection and all 32 teams are involved.”That’s a point picked up by Lindy’s Sports UK\u0026nbspeditor Simon Milham. “The biggest non-event in sports is the Premier League Transfer deadline day,” he says. “A yellow tie and boundless enthusiasm, attempting to play up the merits of average players and loan deals does not cut it, I’m afraid.“The NFL Draft, on the other hand, is unique. The draft and the scouting combine before it are things of beauty. The possibility that one or two players will be able to help your team rise from a losing record to the playoffs the following season is a real one, because it happens. Parity exists in the NFL. There are fine margins and a limited 16-game regular season where every game matters.”It’s a great way to level the playing field. Every team has the prospect of coming out of the NFL Draft with a star player added to their rosterParity is, of course, a key aim of a draft that allocates the first pick of the college players who declare (they have to be three years out of high school)\u0026nbspto the worst team, and proceeds through the league in reverse order with the Super Bowl winner picking last in each of the seven rounds.\u0026nbspThis doesn’t prevent teams like the aforementioned Patriots from winning consistently, or the likes of the Cleveland Browns and the Oakland Raiders from losing most of the time. You still have to pick the right players.\u0026nbspBut it’s thanks to the draft that Browns fans can finally see some light at the end of the tunnel now that they have quarterback Baker Mayfield, last year’s number-one overall pick, running their offence.\u0026nbsp“It’s a great way to level the playing field. Every team has the prospect of coming out of the NFL Draft with a star player added to their roster. And you never know where you are going to find that player,” says Sky Sports NFL expert Neil Reynolds. “Patrick Mahomes was a first-rounder who has gone on to enjoy great success with the Kansas City Chiefs but talent can also be found in later rounds, most notably with (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady (sixth round in 2000) or wide receiver Antonio Brown (sixth round in 2010).”\u0026nbspThe latter was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers but forced a trade to the Oakland Raiders in what has been an unusually entertaining start to the new NFL year.\u0026nbspO’Reilly believes that draft’s springtime setting – this year’s will kick off on 26 April\u0026nbsp– further fuels its popularity.\u0026nbspAs the days lengthen, and the sun appears more regularly, people are in the mood for a party. The draft has turned into one, particularly with its having gone mobile.\u0026nbspTaking it out of its traditional New York home and moving it around the US has proven to be a masterstroke.It was always closely watched, even when the league was building its power, following the merger with the AFL at the end of the 1960s. But it used to consist of a group of executives sitting around in a New York hotel room making phone calls\u0026nbspmade up with their teams’ logos\u0026nbsphardly the sort of thing to excite a TV executive.\u0026nbspThe decision to mobilise it, and have cities bid for it, as they do the Super Bowl, has given the NFL’s planners the facility to let their creativity run wild, as well as providing the league with a nice windfall. \u0026nbsp“Since we made the decision to leave New York and bring the draft to different fans and turn it into a big free celebration of the game, it really has taken off, drawing hundreds of thousands of fans,” says O’Reilly.\u0026nbsp“It’s a very different vibe. You see fans of all 32 teams. It is free and accessible and there’s a camaraderie. Spring is in the air and everyone is feeling good. It is this oasis that everybody gathers around.”O’Reilly points to efforts to ensure that each event “takes on the style of the market we are in”. So this year, in Nashville the music city, there will be music on stage. In 2020 when Las Vegas will be the venue, there will be events along the famous strip as the league heads into the season when the Raiders are scheduled to make the city their home.\u0026nbsp“This year you will see a different energy and more access,” O’Reilly says. “We have started to treat it like a political convention and so there will be a delegation of 50 fans from each team invited to what we call\u0026nbspthe inner circle. When a prospect is picked they will greet the fans and take a selfie with them. The draft really lets us push the envelope.”Attaching this sort of razzamatazz to what was once a relatively low key event is something few sports would be able to pull off. Most wouldn’t have even dared to try.\u0026nbspBut razzamatazz that will only get you so far with the TV people. What the league has also sought to exploit and develop is the storytelling aspect to give its broadcast partners something to draw in viewers.\u0026nbspIn many ways you can see echoes of reality TV in the way these are presented.\u0026nbspThe fan is invited to live the dream alongside young men who have invested everything into reaching the pinnacle of their sport, young men who are often celebrities through their exploits in amateur college football, just without the financial trappings that usually come with it.\u0026nbspNot for nothing did Texas QB Sam Ehlinger describe the college game, which turns over billions of dollars every year with everyone but the players getting a piece of the pie, as a “three-year unpaid internship”.\u0026nbspSays Reynolds: “There is a great deal of drama attached to each NFL Draft and it plays out in a very public way with the top prospects sitting backstage waiting to hear their name called. That can lead to some awkward on-camera moments as a player expected to go high in the draft is forced to sit and wait for sometimes hours on end before finding out where he will play in the NFL.“Also, the NFL Draft is the culmination of a lifelong pursuit for so many players. To become one of the best of the best is an amazing feeling for a young player as so few ever make it as far as the NFL. Seeing players react to hearing their names called is a wonderful thing. But the main drama comes in speculating upon which team is going to take a certain player, along with the in-draft trades that can happen throughout the seven rounds.”\u0026nbspO’Reilly says: “College football is a massive property in this country and growing beyond it. The stories of these prospects are told through their college journey. You want to see how that ends.”This can be found right down through the draft.O’Reilly\u0026nbsphighlights one of last year’s best stories that of Shaquem Griffin, who had his left hand amputated at the age of four after being born with amniotic band syndrome. Griffin ultimately went in the fifth round, making him the 141st selection overall, to the Seattle Seahawks where his brother was already playing. He led the team in tackles in 2018.\u0026nbsp“This year ABC is very focused on storytelling, talking to players moms for example\u0026nbspit starts to draw in people from a wider base,” he says. \u0026nbspThose stories are given added spice by the intrigue and skullduggery that goes on in the background. The draft wouldn’t be the draft without that.\u0026nbspFake news is a vastly overused term, but much of the what is written and broadcast in the run up to it is just that.\u0026nbspAnonymous NFL scouts\u0026nbspor team executives\u0026nbspwill be some of the prime sources of stories over the next few weeks. They’ll be quoted picking holes in the games of the top prospects, making insinuations about their characters, highlighting “red flags”.\u0026nbspQuarterback Kyler Murray, who may go first off the board, has already had his performance in interviews with teams at the scouting combine trashed.There’ll be a lot more of that sort of thing cropping up between now and the draft proper as the media indulges in the game of build ’em up, knock ’em down\u0026nbspwhen it comes to the top prospects. \u0026nbspTeams have an obvious interest in briefing against players they love in the hope of putting rivals off rivals picking higher. Some find it hard to resist indulging it.\u0026nbspFan appetites are further fuelled by the publication of\u0026nbsp“mock” drafts. There will be a new one virtually every day now the big free-agent contracts have been handed out and the draft starts to take centre stage.\u0026nbspCompilers base their predictions on a mix of whom they think teams will pick and whom they think they should pick. Sometimes major news outlets specify which one of those they are leaning towards. Sometimes they don’t. Big names in the sports media\u0026nbspwho have access to teams and their executives –\u0026nbsppeople like ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper, or the doyen of NFL journalists, NBC’s Peter King – are particularly closely watched.\u0026nbspThe rumours\u0026nbspand speculation will reach fever pitch in the few days before the event proper. There’s even more spice added to the mix on the day when teams start trading picks with each other, moving down for extra selections, or up to get the missing piece a they feel will lead to a Super Bowl appearance.Murray is the name on everyone’s lips this year. The former first-round pick of the Oakland A’s in baseball’s much lower key draft, he declared for the NFL after completing a season as starter for the University of Oklahoma, a concession afforded to him by his baseball contract. The NFL will afford him the opportunity to make more money upfront he won’t need to spend years toiling in the minor leagues and could get a big-money second contract in four years if he’s good enough. His college tape indicates that he could be, although you can never really tell. The draft is, when all is said and done, something of a crapshoot. Some teams are just better at it than others.\u0026nbspThe one that gets Murray will have an electrifying prospect on their hands, a player who is equally effective as runner as he is a passer. That’s rare. Quarterbacks usually major on one or the other but not both. \u0026nbspThe main knock on Murray is that he’s only just over 5ft 10in, which makes\u0026nbsphim the smallest starter in the league. The only other sub-6ft\u0026nbsppasser is the Seattle Seahawks’ Russell Wilson. Murray’s slight build also worries some scouts (Wilson is built like a pocket battleship).\u0026nbspMany expect him to go first overall to the Arizona Cardinals, despite their having traded up to select Josh Rosen in the first round of last year’s draft, because he’d be an ideal fit for the offence preferred by new coach Kliff Kingsbury.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.American football: Excess all areas - behind the scenes at the NFL Draft Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former New England Patriots guard Joe Andruzzi, who assisted in rescuing an injured victim from the Boston Marathon attack, speaks at the first round of the NFL draft Fans wait inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Kansas City Chiefs fans stand inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)A Miami Dolphins fan wears a U.S. flag under a Dolphins hard hat inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Star Lotulelei, from Utah, reacts next to his wife Fuiva as they hold their daughters Pesatina, 1, left, and Arilani, 3, center, while his niece Elyena Tukuafu, 5, right, cheers after he was selected 14th overall by the Carolina Panthers during an NFL football draft party at their home (AP)New York Jets fans react in the balcony as it was announced that the Jets had selected Sheldon Richardson from the University of Missouri as the 13th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Washington Redskins fans gather outside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Former New England Patriots player Joe Andruzzi stands on stage as a picture of Andruzzi helping a victim of the Boston Marathon bombing attacks is seen on the screen during his appearance at the 2013 NFL Draft  (Reuters)Officials carry caps of the St. Louis Rams, Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears into New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Former New England Patriots player Joe Andruzzi (L) holds a special New England Patriots jersey honoring the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (R) during Andruzzi\u0027s appearance at the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) stands on a stage as the Miami Dolphins unveil their new uniforms during an NFL football draft party (AP)The top NFL draft prospects pose for a group photo with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, front row center, before the first round of the NFL football draft (AP)D.J.

The Cardinals’ pick will be made by his general manager Steve Keim. But it’s hard to imagine him not getting Murray if he wants him.The other quarterback to watch is Dwayne Haskins, who fits the more traditional archetype and has a howitzer of an arm. He’s seen as an ideal fit for the more traditionally minded New York Giants who need to find a long-term replacement for Eli Manning. They have two first-round picks after trading star receiver Odell Beckham Jr to the Browns.\u0026nbspThe Miami Dolphins are also short handed at the game’s key position and Denver could do with help even after trading with the Baltimore Ravens for the declining Joe Flacco.\u0026nbspAs much as quarterbacks always get the attention, there is also an embarrassment of pass rushing riches in this year’s music\u0026nbspcity draft, headed by Nick Bosa, seen by most analysts as the best overall prospect. If he can stay healthy he’ll be frightening quarterbacks for years.\u0026nbspThe Oakland Raiders are the big X factors. They have three pick in round one, having traded two of their best players, Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper, for the first round selections of the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears.\u0026nbspNFL free agency begins Monday with big stars set to get paidBanned NFL player says he will ‘Kaepernick himself’ over marijuana lawWhich NFL team will Antonio Brown play for in 2019?The best pick from each round of the NFL draftShaquem Griffin is undoubtedly the story of the NFL draft- here’s whyNo one’s quite sure what their mercurial coach Jon Gruden and his general manager Mike Mayock, a former TV analyst, will do. They badly need a pass rusher to replace Mack. But Gruden has also spoken of his love for Murray, despite having a veteran starting QB in the form of Derek Carr. Could they trade up with the Cardinals? Gruden likes to deal and he probably will, only adding to the drama.\u0026nbspWith all that and more in the mix, O’Reilly and his bosses have good cause to feel optimistic about the ratings. There will be a lot of their beloved stories for a football crazy media to feast on, and draw viewers to one of the various live broadcasts (Sky will join in the fun through the early hours on this side of the pond).\u0026nbsp“Possibility over the proven commodity is engrained in our psychology,” reflects Milham. “Premiums are paid for potential rather than achievement in many walks of life, which is absurd when you think about it, but it’s always there.”As for the event’s future, London could one day be calling. Not soon. But the NFL’s interest in globalising the game remains strong.\u0026nbsp“We have seen and we expect to see more players coming into the draft from outside the US who are incredible athletes,” says O’Reilly.\u0026nbsp“I wouldn’t rule it out. Theres such strong interest from US in hosting. We’ve been in New York for 51 years and there are 20-plus markets wanting to host it to focus on.\u0026nbsp“But there has been so much success we have had with the games in UK, and Mexico. We certainly think about opportunities to reach international fans. It’s not imminent but its not far-fetched.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But that\u0027s what science is all about, right?\u0027Click to followThe IndependentSpace is doing some strange things to astronauts\u0027 bodies, a new study has found.The Nasa twins study is looking at two twins – Scott and Mark Kelly – in an attempt to understand the affects of spaceflight on people\u0027s health and physiology. By having one remain on Earth while another lived on the International Space Station for more than a year, researchers are able to compare the two in an attempt to understand what difference to the trip into space made.Now early results show a host of unusual changes happened to Scott when he headed into space. That included the discovery that in some ways, a person\u0027s health is not greatly affected at all by a trip into space.Perhaps most unusually, researchers looked at how astronauts aged when they were on board the International Space Station. They did so in part by looking at the pair\u0027s telomeres, or the protective caps that sit on the end of chromosomes and reflect the ageing process in the body, since they typically shorten as a person ages.In fact, though Scott\u0027s telomeres lengthened out when he was in space, a discovery that shocked the researchers.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

But that\u0027s what science is all about, right?But they then also found that they dramatically lengthened again when getting back down. While most of them settled back down again over time and have gone back to normal, he now has more short telomeres than when he set off, suggesting that spaceflight could be associated with age-related conditions.Otherwise, the study found that the effects of the year-long flight were largely similar to time spent in any other stressful environment. There were changes in Scott\u0027s gene expression levels and his gut flora, for instance, but after six months back on Earth they had settled back to normal.Given that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight, the authors wrote.Studying the identical twins, who were 50 years old at the start of the study, gave scientists a unique opportunity to compare iniduals with the same genetic material subjected to different environments.Exposure to radiation, lower gravity, less exercise, a restricted diet and disrupted sleep are among the possible risks of spending time in space.The International Space Station is teeming with bacteria and fungiMark is a fellow astronaut and has also been to space before, but not for almost four years prior to Scott\u0027s mission.The twins study is certainly the most comprehensive view that we\u0027ve ever had of the response of the human body to space flight, Professor Susan Bailey, from Colorado State University, said.Blood samples, physiological data and cognitive measurements were taken from the brothers at regular intervals over 25 months.While Scott was in space, his samples were sent back to Earth with shipments that had delivered supplies by rocket to the ISS.Changes to the shape of Scott\u0027s eyeball, including a thicker retinal nerve, were among those detected, as well as a decline in some of his cognitive abilities.The scientists also found that the astronaut\u0027s telomeres - the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes - got longer while he was in space.Telomeres typically shorten as someone becomes older and are associated with cardiovascular diseases and some cancers.However, many rapidly decreased in length after the flight, and he now has more short telomeres than long ones.There were also changes in the expression of some of Scott\u0027s genes, particularly those related to the immune system.However, more than 90 per cent\u0026nbspof these had returned to normal six months after the flight.Persistent changes were observed in a few other areas, including some cognitive function.There are dramatic changes, there are thousands of genes and molecular changes, that occur as someone goes in space, Dr Mike Snyder, from Stanford University School of Medicine, said.I think it\u0027s reassuring to know that when you come back things will largely be back to the same.Scientists believe the findings could help predict possible health complications during long-term missions.If we know what to expect, we can anticipate health problems astronauts may encounter and ensure that medicines and other remedies are at hand during a mission, Dr Andy Feinberg, at Johns Hopkins University, said.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I went out to the garden with the dogs. I have a big torch and we have had to resort to putting big floodlights up to scare it off.”Punters vow never to bet on Grand National again after horse death“I saw two large green eyes reflecting in the torch light at the bottom of the garden.“You’re told to make yourself appear big and aggressive and scare it off. I shouted to it and was waving my arms around and it actually started to run towards me.”\u0026nbspOfficers from Devon and Cornwall Police attended the scene and took plaster casts of the animal’s paw prints, which\u0026nbspwere almost 5in wide.The casts have been sent off for analysis. The RSPCA also attended the scene.“Our officer attended after reports that a labrador had been scratched by a large, black cat,” a spokesperson for the animal charity said.\u0026nbsp“Thankfully, the dog is fine although he has scratch marks, and the owner is taking precautions to keep an eye on the dog in case of further sightings.”Ms Abrey said she had read about reports of a large black cat in the area but had dismissed them.“When I read about them I always think, ‘it’s just a decent-sized farm cat’ but this certainly wasn’t,” she said.“It was at least Alsatian sized or bigger.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Keeping local authority infrastructure in good condition is essential to ensure the wider road network stays safe and productive and helps the economy grow.“We need the certainty of a long-term steady and sustained funding arrangement to allow London to cover the costs of its own infrastructure maintenance.”AA president Edmund King said: “We can’t afford to have Hammersmith Bridge closed ‘indefinitely’. It is an essential artery to keep London moving.“It will cause major congestion and hence more emissions – ironically in the same week that the ultra-low emission zone kicked off.“The Thames is already a barrier to mobility in London, so we can’t afford to have an essential bridge closed for a long period.“We have only half as many bridges over the Thames than there are over the Seine in Paris.

It is a tremendous opportunity and I hope I can live up to his journalistic dedication and reputation,”\u0026nbspMs Shehadi said.The £5,000 prize is supported by The Independent\u0026nbspand will be awarded by the Rupert Cornwell Trust.On behalf of the judges and the trust, Cornwell’s widow Susan, US congressional correspondent for Reuters, praised Ms Shehadi’s\u0026nbsp“original and compelling” proposal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We were moved by her pitch offering a deeply-reported look at the future of a persecuted and stateless minority.\u0026nbspWe were also impressed by her previous articles that blended news with cultural narratives from Lebanon to Sri Lanka and Nepal, and her persistence Lemma has made strong applications for the award two years in a row. She clearly is a highly-motivated journalist with a bright future.”Annual journalism award set up to honour Independent’s Rupert CornwellIn a competition which attracted a generally very high standard of entries, the judges also highly commended Amanda Coakley,\u0026nbspThomas Graham and Felix Light for their proposals, which “showed great potential”.\u0026nbspThe Rupert Cornwell Award was established in memory of the distinguished foreign correspondent and writer who died two years ago. It is designed to fund a suitable journalistic project in one of the broad regions Cornwell\u0026nbspcovered – North America, Europe and the former Soviet Union.\u0026nbspIt also commemorates one of the great foreign correspondents of modern times.He embodied the spirit of the newly launched Independent in 1986, and he remained one of its the wisest and most eloquent voices until his death last year, aged 71, still writing for the title.From his earliest reports for the Financial Times from Rome to chronicling the fall of the USSR to his last pieces on the Trump phenomenon, he remained a source of inspiration for all of his colleagues, and now for a new generation of writers as well.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Six months are now available to break the impasse.Today, a Labour spokesperson confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn had had a further meeting with Theresa May, adding: “Both sides agreed to continue talks in an effort to make substantive progress towards finding a compromise plan.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Cliffs of Dover lit up in Brexit protest Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by Nigel Farage on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message to the EU on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by Nigel Farage on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message to the EU on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Before parliament returns to debating Brexit, however, the House of Commons will from today break for a week-long Easter recess, and return on 23 April. Talks between Labour and the government are expected to continue during this period.\u0026nbspWill the UK leave the EU on Halloween?The prime minister’s request of a 30 June extension was rebuffed by European leaders, who agreed to extend the negotiating period until the end of October. Theoretically, the UK could leave on Halloween, but given the previous adjustable dates of 29 March and 12 April, it’s not beyond the realms of possibility of another extension later this year.Could we leave the EU some time before then?Yes. If MPs manage to break the deadlock and agree on a withdrawal agreement in good time before 31 October, the UK can leave on the first day of the month following the passing of a deal.\u0026nbspIt was also agreed in Brussels that if the UK does not participate in next month’s European elections the country would be forced to leave the bloc on 1 June, without a deal.\u0026nbspWhat happens if we have no plan in place by the Halloween deadline?The legal default is that Britain will leave the EU without a deal, on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms – a route preferred by some Brexiteers in the Conservative Party. European leaders, who are growing increasingly impatient with Brexit, may also object to a third extension.Theresa May sets herself up to stay on as prime minister until winterBut with parliament and the prime minister so clearly against such a path for the UK, it would appear Ms May and MPs would rather seek another extension over a no-deal scenario if they fail to reach an agreement by the Halloween deadline.\u0026nbspCould we have a general election, a second referendum or a new Conservative leader?Given the current uncertainty at Westminster, all of these scenarios remain on the table.\u0026nbspSupporters of a fresh referendum may now feel emboldened given that the UK now has six months to find a solution to the Brexit crisis. Advocates of such a route will now claim there is enough time to hold a “confirmatory vote” on Theresa May’s deal, but given no majority remains among MPs for the option, it still remains difficult to achieve for campaigners.\u0026nbspThere are now only two Brexit choices: revoke or referendumDoes the Brexit extension make a second referendum more likely?Theresa May sets herself up to stay on as prime minister until winterTheresa May disowned Tory Brexiteers in meeting with EU leadersBrexit Halloween is coming, but it’s already the Day of the Braindead If the talks between Labour and the government eventually break down – as many in Westminster anticipate will happen – the chance of a general election may also accelerate a notch.\u0026nbspAnd given the Conservative Party’s next conference will be held in Manchester towards the end of September, Ms May will face considerable pressure before then to stand down as prime minister, making way for a new Tory leader.\u0026nbspBut in Brussels on Wednesday evening, a Conservative source said Ms May’s promised departure date to her MPs was tied to passing the withdrawal agreement, rather than a specific date.Will MPs have another meaningful vote on Theresa May’s deal?Theoretically, yes. But given the prime minister’s own deal has been rejected three times by parliament – and MPs now know Ms May will avoid a no-deal scenario at all costs – it is likely to be defeated yet again if she brings it back to the House of Commons.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I believe we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest.”Created with Sketch.Cliffs of Dover lit up in Brexit protest Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by Nigel Farage on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message to the EU on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by Nigel Farage on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this statement by former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message to the EU on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4Campaign group Led By Donkeys projected this message on the Cliffs of Dover on the evening of April 4But she acknowledged that reaching agreement in talks with Labour “will not be easy”, with both her and Mr Corbyn indicating the other side should compromise further on their positions.A No 10 source said the government would continue to pursue the dialogue as long as they believed it was making progress, but added: “Bluntly, we won’t continue to talk for the sake of it.”Ms May said that if they could not agree a single unified approach, they would seek to agree a “small number” of options which\u0026nbspwould then be put to the house for MPs to vote on.Her aides later indicated that if agreement on those could not be reached, then the government would still press ahead with some kind of process soon aimed at finding which option might pass through the commons.If that were still to fail, and possibly even before then, calls for the PM to resign are likely to intensify dramatically as leadership rivals continue to ramp up their campaigns.Ma May brushed off calls to quit from veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash, who described her acceptance of the latest extension to the Article 50 withdrawal process as an “abject surrender”.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itAsked whether the 30 June date was still a red line for the prime minister, the Tory source said: “She understands that the Conservative Party feels a sense that new leadership is required for the second phase of negotiations. That was the commitment she gave to her parliamentary colleagues and that’s one she stands by.”Speaking at a 2.30am press conference after talks closed, the PM again blamed her own MPs for the delay, telling reporters: Over the last three months I have voted three times to leave the European Union. If sufficient members of parliament had voted with me in January we would already be out of the European Union.Back in London Ms May’s detractors were already setting themselves up for a fight, with former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that the PM must be forced out of the job if she returns with a long extension.Merkel backs ‘longer’ Brexit delay than requested by Theresa May“I hate to say this but the reality is if we end up going and accepting a year-long, or even a nine-month extension, I think we’re going to have egg all over our face,” he told Channel 4 News at the same time as the PM\u0026nbspaddressed EU leaders over the channel in Brussels.“It’s time for us to bite the bullet and say, look, we can’t do this any longer, we have to make a change.“The whole thing is an utter car crash and I think what has to be established now is I think the cabinet has to have a moment with the prime minister and say this can’t go on, I’m afraid, it really can’t go on.”But the prime minister’s allies simultaneously rallied around her. Justice secretary David Gauke said that there was no rush to change leader, and that “it may well be the last thing we need as a country is a leadership election”.Mr Gauke told BBC Radio 5Live’s Emma Barnett programme: “If it helps the country she will walk, if it helps the country for her to stay she will stay. She will do what she thinks is the right thing for the country.”Ahead of a late night summit in Brussels EU leaders signalled that they were looking at giving the prime minister an extension of either nine or 12 months. Donald Tusk, the European Council president, has suggested that such an extension could have a flexible end date, and terminate shortly after the withdrawal agreement is approved by the UK parliament.UK could have ‘a say’ in customs union after Brexit, Varadkar saysBrexit secretary admits EU now \u0027in control\u0027 of UK\u0027s departureDUP brands May\u0027s Brexit talks with European leaders ‘humiliating\u0027After pressure from France, which argued strongly against a long extension until 2020, the Council agreed to a slightly shorter delay until October with a stock-taking exercise in June. The\u0026nbspreview at the start of the summer is\u0026nbspexpected to\u0026nbspassess UK co-operation during and after May’s European elections.European Council president Donald Tusk said at a 2am press conference: “Let me finish with a message to our British friends: this extension is as flexible as I expected, an a little bit shorter than I expected, but it’s still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.”He added: “I think it’s always best to have a piece of something than all of nothing.”The new 31 October deadline also aligns with the end of the current Commission presidency. Speaking alongside Mr Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker joked: I like the decision we have taken tonight because the end date has been fixed on the 31 October. I have to leave my job on 1 November. So my guess will be that we won\u0027t have an overnight session because if we have one I\u0027ll have to leave the meeting at midnight.Ms May is\u0026nbspunderstood to have given a one-hour presentation to the 27 leaders setting out her case for an extension to June 30, with a break clause allowing the UK to leave as soon as her Brexit deal is ratified by MPs.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She had publicly been endorsing a 30 June extension after agreeing to that date with her cabinet.Theresa May sets herself up to stay on as prime minister until winterLast week Mr\u0026nbspRees-Mogg, a leading figure in the Brexiteer European Research\u0026nbspGroup of Tory\u0026nbspMPs, had said that “if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible”.Just hours after Wednesday’s meeting, EU officials had already started preparing for the possibility of yet another extension of Article 50 past October.\u0026nbspThe Independent understands that the withdrawal agreement needs to be redrafted to remove three references to the 29 March 2019 exit date, which has now passed. But instead of replacing the old date with the new 31 October one, the treaty will simply say it comes into force a day after it is ratified – to provide flexibility for further extensions.Created with Sketch.

The vast majority of member states are said to have been open to an even longer extension until 2020, but France – which wanted a shorter deadline to put pressure on the UK – dug its heels in.Rees-Mogg has called on the UK to be difficult if Brexit is delayed for a long time (EPA)Ultimately a compromise was reached, with an extension until 31 October and a review of the situation in June to placate the French president. Officials cautioned that the June date would not be particularly significant. They added that 31 October was chosen for “purely technical” reasons and not because it was Halloween.EU officials have confirmed that the extension will eat into the Brexit\u0026nbsptransition period: its termination date of 2021 with an option to extend by two years will not be changed.The inclination to push the United Kingdom into no deal is not a very popular one in the European Council.Reports that the UK\u0026nbspwill be stripped of its EU commissioner during the Article 50 extension have also proven to be exaggerated.\u0026nbspThe UK will be asked to nominate a commissioner\u0026nbspand the nominee will go through hearings as normal. Only once the UK has left will it lose its commissioner, leaving it without representation during the transition period.The prime minister returns to Westminster with her party on the brink of all-out civil war. On Wednesday in Westminster former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith called on Theresa May to quit if she came back from Brussels with a long extension, which she has now obtained. Some of the PM’s allies rallied around her, however. Justice secretary David Gauke warned that it may not be in the country’s interests to replace Ms May immediately.Tory sources close to Ms May have confirmed that she only intends to quit once the withdrawal agreement has been passed, and has no specific departure date.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cherokee syllabary inscription from 1.5km into Manitou Cave (average element vertical height approximately 80mm)At first glance, it looked like a set of black numbers and letters written in English, perhaps with some symbols included.It had gone unnoticed for nearly 200 years in a cave nestled in a wooded hillside overlooking Fort Payne, Alabama - population 14,000, about 60 miles southwest of Chattanooga, Tennessee - and was partially covered by graffiti.But when cave explorers found the inscriptions, they realized the significance. After years of research and analysis, a team of Native American scholars and anthropologists determined the inscriptions are the first evidence of the Cherokee syllabary - the tribe\u0027s written system that uses symbols to create words - ever found in a cave. It details the secluded, ceremonial activities of the tribe that once occupied the area.People had probably been looking at and passing by this for years, but they just didn\u0027t know what they were looking at, said Beau Duke Carroll, a Cherokee who co-authored a story in the anthropology magazine Antiquity on the inscriptions.The inscriptions inside Manitou Cave of Alabama are in the Cherokee syllabary developed by Cherokee scholar Sequoyah. He had enlisted in the US\u0026nbspArmy under Andrew Jackson to fight rebelling Creek Indians and had become interested in how whites used the alphabet to communicate.Created with Sketch.Talking stones: Cherokee syllabary in Manitou Cave Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cherokee syllabary inscription from 1.5km into Manitou Cave (average element vertical height approximately 80mm)Beau Duke Carroll and Julie Reed in Manitou Cave, with Cherokee syllabary visible on the ceilingCherokee syllabary, hand written version in Sequoyah’s own hand (Sequoyah’s hand syllabary, ink on paper, GM4926.488, Glicrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma reproduced with permissionPair of isolated Cherokee syllabary elements (average syllabary element height approximately 100mm)Engraved Cherokee syllabary inscription from 1.5km into Manitou Cave in the same area as Figure 3.

By the 1820s, scholars said, more than half of Cherokees could use the syllabary - a far higher literacy rate than most tribes had with their written languages. Using the syllabary was also helpful in allowing Cherokees to send messages as they contended with invading whites.In the 1780s, Fort Payne, then known as Willstown, became much like a refugee camp of Native Americans who had sided with the British in the American Revolution and were being forced from their ancestral homelands as part of the government\u0027s relocation program, known as the Trail of Tears. It involved more than 100,000 Native Americans being forced to move to areas west of the Mississippi River.Willstown was called the most important town in the Cherokee nation by government authorities. Sequoyah lived there at one point in his life.The caves, which sit on private land and are now closed to the public, were used by Cherokees as places for rituals and ceremonies. Scholars said the inscriptions reflect the conflict they faced, as some Cherokees choose to assimilate and others were wanting to resist.This puts a definitive face on the use of syllabary and it shows us - in their own words - what the Cherokees of that time were doing, said Jan Simek, an anthropologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. For archaeologists, that\u0027s a remarkable outcome because you\u0027re usually interpreting symbols or words. But here they are telling us, \u0027We were practising in our old ways - look.\u0027 Deep inside the Manitou cave, experts said, is an inscription near a small creek that tells of a stick ball game, a traditional Native American game similar to but more violent than lacrosse. The game is often called the little brother of war. An inscription there translates to the leaders of the stick ball game on the 30th day in their month April 1828, so it\u0027s likely referring to a game that was played that day.Cherokees typically went into a cave before a stick ball game to mentally and physically prepare themselves with a medicine man or spiritual adviser. They would cleanse themselves with water and smoke, then dance and pray.Another inscription details the stick ball game that translates to We who have blood come out of their nose and mouth.Experts said that would have been indicative of Cherokee customs to re-enter the cave during an intermission or after a game. Cherokees respected that blood was a powerful liquid and believed such ceremonies kept the blood outside the body from disrupting the world, according to Julie Reed, a Cherokee and historian at Pennsylvania State University who worked on the paper.Two-Spirit: Meet the Native Americans embracing LGBT+Discovery sheds light on mystery of ancient American city’s downfallPink defends her criticism of student who mocked Native American manHere we have indigenous people using a written language to tell us what they want to say, Reed said, rather than us having to do intellectual imagination of what they\u0027re trying to tell us.As a Cherokee, I was like, \u0027Wow,\u0027  she said of her cave visits to the inscriptions.Some of the inscriptions are signed by Richard Guess, who was one of Sequoyah\u0027s sons and likely a ceremonial leader at the stick ball game.Carroll, who did his master\u0027s thesis at the University of Tennessee on the cave inscriptions, said he believes the Cherokees played stick ball just to forget, kind of entertainment and escape from the reality around them. They were under pressure from federal authorities and Christian missionaries to end such rituals.Another inscription in the cave was on a ceiling about 40 feet above ground. The anthropologists said it read, I am your grandson.Cherokees were probably sending a message to their spiritual beings that lived here before Cherokees, Carroll said.David Penney, an associate director for scholarship, exhibitions and public engagement at the Smithsonian\u0027s National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, said the cave inscriptions are unique from other historical finds.They reflect an aspect of Cherokee life before removal that\u0027s otherwise hidden or obscured from the historical record, he said.Elizabeth Warren apologises for calling herself Native AmericanMr Penney said the Cherokee syllabary found in the cave is especially interesting because history is often written by the victors. And this really is an aspect of Cherokee history that really comes from the Cherokees themselves.For Carroll, the cave was a chance to look deep at his own people\u0027s history and see his tribe\u0027s written language in a spot where it had existed for generations.

Airbnb implies its new policy will not distinguish between settlement listings and Palestinian listingsAirbnb\u0026nbsphas reversed its plan to delist homes in\u0026nbspIsraeli\u0026nbspsettlements in the occupied West Bank in a move condemned by human rights organisations as “outrageous” and “frankly insulting”.The company announced in November\u0026nbspit would remove around 200 listings from the area, which is claimed by Palestinians as territory for a future state.On Tuesday Airbnb said it will now allow properties in Israeli settlements to be listed, but\u0026nbspwill donate all profits from properties in the West Bank to humanitarian aid organisations.Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal by most world powers.“Airbnb’s decision to support hosting in illegal West Bank settlements is outrageous,” Ryvka Barnard, from the War on Want charity, told The Independent. “Dropping a few coins into a charity box does not make up for war crimes.”\u0026nbspShe added: “Settlements are illegal under international law. They violate the fourth Geneva convention, amounting to a war crime. Abiding by international law is not optional, and making donations to somehow try to cancel out those violations, as Airbnb intends to do, is insulting to the Palestinians suffering from such violations, and makes a mockery of international law.”“This is a huge mistake by Airbnb who has now put its reputation on the line, and will rightly be targeted in the same way businesses seeking to profit from apartheid South Africa were.”Israeli PM Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank territory if re-electedUS cuts all aid to Palestinians in occupied West Bank and GazaAmnesty urges travel sites to ban listings at Israeli settlementsBen Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said Airbnb’s decision was “frankly insulting”.“With this disgraceful decision, Airbnb have utterly failed the Palestinian people.”“By continuing to do business in settlements, they remain complicit in the abuses settlements trigger.”But others celebrated the news, including\u0026nbspNitsana Darshan-Leitner, the director of a Tel Aviv-based Israeli advocacy group, who said:\u0026nbsp“The policy Airbnb announced last November was abject discrimination against Jewish users of the website.“We commend Airbnb for recognising that it had landed on the wrong side of this issue and changing the policy.”Airbnb’s decision in November led to it being\u0026nbspsued in the US by 12 dual American-Israeli citizens who own homes in the settlements.Under the plan, Airbnb users could still book about\u0026nbsp20,000 properties\u0026nbspin Israel and there would still have been listings\u0026nbspin other disputed areas such as East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.Announcing a resolution to the case, the company said it\u0026nbsp“will not move forward with implementing the removal of listings in the West Bank from the platform”.“But Airbnb will take no profits from this activity in the region,”\u0026nbspthe company said in a statement posted on its website, implying it would not\u0026nbspdistinguish between Israeli settlement listings and Palestinian listings in the West Bank.“Any profits generated for Airbnb ... will be donated to non-profit organisations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world.”Israel captured and annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War.

From cuddling people for money to mourning the deaths of strangers on a day-to-day basis, theres a whole glut of unusual and downright wacky jobsyoure looking for a career change. Even better, most of them dont even require prior training or experience. Soyoure desperate to get out of the office for good, heres a look at some of the strangest jobs that you could be doing - and how to apply for them.Employer: The International Fragrance AssociationSalary: £,How to apply: Apply via their websiteWeve all had days where weve got to work and been forced to spend the day sat next to a colleague whos got a particularly pungent odour emanating from their pits. But you could put an end to that by making sure lacklustre deodorants dont make it to the market.Armpit smellers are employed by companies to help test out the latest products that combat sweat and body odour - and all you have to do is give a big whf to someone whos just been working out on a treadmill for an hour. The average income tallies up to £, a year, so its not so bad.Businesses may call on nose judges to determine the effectiveness of cat litter or shoe insoles at controlling unpleasant smells too.Theres a job out there for anyone with a well-trained nose. Employer: NASASalary: £, for  daysHow to apply: Apply via their websiteMost of us cant get enough of it no matter how hard we try - but NASA hires professional sleepers who are, you guessed it, given the arduous task of having to sleep for days on end.Why  Its all in the name of science.Volunteers get paid up to £, to sleep for a whopping  days in a row so scientists can study the effect of dferent air pressures on the human body.Bed rest studies offer scientists ways to see how the body adapts to weightlessness. Participants must live, eat, and even shower in the same position.This causes their bodies - and cardiovascular systems - to adapt asthey were in space and they are continuously monitored to understand how their bodies change.Results allow countermeasures to be devised that will help astronauts on space missions, as well as bed-ridden people on Earth. So you get to sleep through seven Mondays and you get to help the future of the human race in the process - could there be a better job  If space isnt your thing, then you can try the same thing a little closer to home in Finland.Helsinkis Hotel Finn hires full-time sleepers to test the comfort of their beds in order to help them improve their guest experience. Salary: £K- £How to apply: Contact your pooch’s favourite pet food brand with a CV, or check their website for vacancies.Wed always thought that it was humans that tested on animals - not the other way around. A pet food taster has the rather disgusting job of being sent the latest pet food flavours and giving them a try. While dogs and cats have dferent tastes to us, its a tasters job to make sure each ingredient is balanced in the right way.Phillip Wells, a former taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food, told Sun Online that the job has even helped him improve his own cooking skills.“Trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking this works especially well on the dry kibbles,” he says.Impressively, the salary can range from anywhere between £, and £, depending on how long youve been doing the job and just how refined your tastebuds are. Employer: Cuddle PartySalary: £ an hourHow to apply: sign up for a -week virtual training courseIn a world where we meet everyone through apps, sometimes the intimacy of face-to-face contact is missing from peoples lives. Thats where professional cuddlers are here to help. Theyre cashing in up to £p h for non-sexual hugging, and experts claim that the rise in their popularity is down to an unlikely factor - Donald Trump. Marcia Baczynski, co-founder of Cuddle Party, said that the state of the world is driving people to look for comfort in the unlikeliest of places.Professional cuddler Ian Carmen, whos been doing the job for a couple of years now, insisted that its not as sexual as people may think. He told Sun Online: When Im with someone theres sometimes a sexual moment but you learn to deal with and acknowledge it but you dont encourage it and it eventually passes. Employer: Same Ole Lines DudesSalary: £ an hourHow to apply: Find positions through their websiteWe know a thing or two about queuing here in the UK, but did you know that some people actually get paid to stand in a line  One man based in NYC, Robert Samuel, got so much business that he’s since started up his own company in the US.Surprisingly, not all of his clients are just super rich: “It’s all everyday people too.“Sometimes I get a customer who can’t get out of work on time to wait for a movie premiere, or somebody on the Upper East Side who really wants a new Xbox but doesn’t want to stand in the cold for seven hours before it goes on sale. It’s a whole medley.”It’s not just people that will employ you to queue. Sometimes brands will pay money for you to stand outside their stores in a bid to make them look more popular, and therefore attract more potential customers.It’s win win. You can usually earn around p h on the job, which requires absolutely no skill apart from an ability to stand around doing nothing.Employer: First ChoiceSalary: £KHow to apply: Contact First Choice directlyIf you loved water parks as a kid then this may just be the perfect job for you - but theres a catch - only one person gets to do it so competition is seriously tough. Water slide maker First Choice selected Seb Smith to be their water slide tester in . He beat out over  other applicants for the role, and since then has got to travel around the world for six months every year testing out the latest rides and rating their fun-factor.“It can be tough when it’s chilly and you have to strip off, but otherwise it’s great,” say previous employee Tommy Lynch. “Getting to check out the flumes is by far the best bit. But there is a serious side and it carries a lot of responsibility.”The job pays £, over the six month period every year, so youre basically free to just chill for the other six months.First Choice only hire one expert, so you’ll have to wait until Seb’s ready to quit unfortunately!Employer: Tokyo travel authoritySalary: DOEHow to apply: At the local stationIf you think your commute is bad, then spare a thought for those in Japan who literally find themselves being shoved onto a train so the doors can stay shut. Tokyo is home to one of the busiest and most efficient rail services in the world, but it doesnt happen without help during peak hours. During rush hour, the trains become so overcrowded that subway pushers - or Oshiya - are hired to cram as many people inside as possible.Sometimes people are wedged in so tightly by pushers that their feet arent even touching the ground. Suddenly London seems like bliss in comparison.Unfortunately this one is only available in Japan.

A chance to stand on our own two feet friends and partners with our EU neighbours, but not bound to them.That is why I am a strong supporter of the Government’s deal.Negotiated over two years, the deal allows us to deliver on things I campaigned on in the referendum.It allows us to take back control of our borders and our laws, stop sending those vast sums of money to the EU, and to make our own trade deals across the world.I’m an optimist, but I’m also a realist. We need to face up to the maths. That deal has not got the backing of enough MPs.Parliament has rejected the deal three times, and it doesn’t look like we’re about to see the Commons change its mind. The other reality is that Parliament has made clear that it won’t accept a no-deal Brexit.So we face a simple, binary choice leaving with a deal, or don’t leave at all. No Brexit. I know which I prefer.The Government has always been clear that failing to deliver Brexit would be a betrayal of the people who turned out to vote in the  referendum — who marked their ballot papers thinking, quite rightly, that whichever side won would see what they voted for delivered.So to get Brexit delivered and to respect the referendum result we needed to change approach. I’m not happy that it has come to this, but this is where we are.This is why the Prime Minister has initiated talks with the Leader of the Opposition, to find a way to leave the EU with a deal.In order for these talks to be constructive both sides will need to give some ground.Again, I don’t pretend to be happy about this butthey fail to do so, we will be back to square one.The PM is ready to compromise, and Jeremy Corbyn has indicated that he wants to make progress too.This is a good thing. We may be members of dferent political parties, but people didn’t vote on Brexit along party lines - they voted because they had real concerns about real things that were impacting their lives.In fact the Conservative and Labour parties do already agree on a number of things.Like ending free movement, protecting jobs and maintaining international security cooperation.The PM has written to Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to request an extension to the Article  period so we can agree a way forward.But be under no illusion, the Government wants this delay to be as short as possible. We know that businesses and people across the country want to move on. So do we.We want to raty the deal before  May so that we do not need to take part in European Parliament elections. But to do that, we MPs will also need to be decisive. We can’t just keep saying what we are against, we need to say what we are for.Whatever the result of these cross-party talks, MPs will need to vote again, and that vote cannot simply be more of the same.We need decisions, not inertia. We need to realise that there is no such thing as a perfect Brexit.If five years ago Brexiteers could see that we were now so close to leaving the EU, deciding and controlling our own immigration policy, keeping those billions of pounds, controlling agriculture and fisheries, making our own laws, we would have jumped at the chance to secure it.And to the MPs who say “it’s not quite right” I remind them that our new relationship with the EU is not set in stone. It will evolve.Future Governments will be able to make changes to policy just like we do in other areas of government.The NHS of today is not the same as the NHS created in  governments adapt and reflect on the needs of their electorates at dferent times.Immigration policy, trade policy and European foreign policy will be election issues in the future just as economic policy, health policy and defence policy are now. Brexit . can be evolved, improved, amended, and adapted.But onlywe leave. It is better to leave the EU imperfectly than not at all.I am looking forward to joining my colleagues in the Government who are doing all they can to get a deal over the line, and get us out of the EU.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And yet, almost three years later, MPs are flailing around making a complete hash of this simple instruction.Whether they voted to leave or to remain, Conservative or Labour, people feel that their votes are being ignored, their voices unheard and that the political antics are paralysing their lives and UK industry. We must not let this national humiliation for our country, the Conservative Party and the government continue.And I’m afraid this comes down to leadership. The Prime Minister has always seen the result of the  referendum as a problem to be resolved, not as a magnicent opportunity to be embraced.That’s why the Withdrawal Agreement is such a bad deal, because we’ve been bending over backwards to accommodate everything that Brussels wants rather than robustly representing British interests. This has got to stop.In the Commons this week, MPs rightly voted against us staying in the EU Customs Union. Doing so would scupper any chance of us having our own independent trade policy and, frankly, it is insulting to people’s intelligence to suggest that staying inside the EU Customs Union is compatible with us leaving the EU.Yet instead of listening to this majority in Parliament, the government has instead chosen to invite a Marxist into No to shape their Brexit policy for them. I don’t remember telling voters in our  Conservative Manesto that we would leave the Customs Union and Single Market unless Jeremy Corbyn insisted otherwise.The public wants MPs to compromise and agree a way forward. But they already have done, twice.First, an overwhelming majority voted to trigger Article  so that we could leave the EU on th March  with or without a deal. Second, the “Brady amendment”, passed in January, asked the Prime Minister toto the EU to replace the “backstop” with “alternative arrangements” so that her deal could get through the House of Commons.MPs have been persistently sidelined by No’s bunker mentality, which is why we’re in such a mess. It baffles me as to why we are allowing this embarrassing pantomime to continue.It’s time for our country to hold firm and for our Government to deliver what the House of Commons voted for. The EU must be left in no doubt that we either achieve meaningful, legally-binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, removing the backstop, or we walk away with no agreement. The ball is in the EU’s court.Negotiations with the EU always conclude in the final hours and things were always going to get tough. “Nothing is agreed until everything’s agreed” used to be our philosophy. So we must not cave in, buckle under the strain or give up on the vital task of delivering the referendum result. And we must certainly not take the easy route out and sub-contract our governance to Jeremy Corbyn.The only way to regain our independence whilst enjoying a positive relationship with the EU, to restore trust in our democracy, to bring an end to the paralysing uncertainty and to become an example to the world of what a beacon of free global trade can achieve, is to stand tall and deliver what the people and Parliament voted for.The endless and meaningless delays to Article  are becoming a shameful ritual. Let’s keep faith with the voting public, our activists and our members. We need to re-focus on our values and start showing some vision and optimism for the successful nation we can become once we’ve left.If we don’t the whole country will pay the price when Jeremy Corbyn sweeps into No, this time for good.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then he remembered he let Ant drive people to the auditions one year.The elephant in the room on the opening night of Britain’s Got ­Talent, which was indistinguishable from every other year, apart from Amanda Holden, who’s showing the first distressing signs of developing early-onset bingo wings.There are one or two other weird little changes as well, but not among the acts, who included the usual smattering of carefully selected ­foreign imports, hardy veterans like ­ventriloquist JimmyTamley, who beat Joe Pasquale to win New Faces in , and a few originals of iable taste and quality.Starting point was a bloke in a dress pretending to be the Queen, followed by some frantic knicker-flashing from Japan’s Fabulous Sisters and Y Pedwar Covi — four old groovers from North Wales with ­frying pans covering their genitals, who are missing a bit of a trick by not calling themselves The Rhyl Full Monty.Straight after those three, we got Jimmy the ventriloquist, fan-wafting opera from the talented Faith Tucker and my own favourite, a bloke in a Dalek outfit who forgot the lyrics to Don’t Worry, Be Happy.Solid enough Saturday night entertainment it was too, until the intrusion of Elizabeth, the mystical illusionist who found Agatha Turner, from the mid- th Century, underneath the London ­Palladium.Which wasn’t half as entertaining as it would’ve beenshe’d found Anthea Turner, from the late th ­Century, ­lurking around down there.It broke up the show’s momentum badly, in fact. To the point I became ­totally distracted by Cowell’s top lip, which kept getting stuck on his veneers and left him flashing his teeth at the acts during crucial points of the show.Victoria Wood tribute act Siobhan ­Phillips got “the teeth” when she sang about her daughter marrying Eric Cowell.So did the Vardanyan Brothers when David Walliams asked: “What happened to your tops ” and the singing Dalek after he was told “Four nos”.I thought at first the teeth might be a distraction technique, butit was designed to stop us noticing the insane cackling noises coming from Amanda Holden, it didn’t work — andhe was hoping to keep our eyes off Ant, it was entirely unnecessary.His reappearance could not have been more seamless.Uncomfortable absence or not,you value great television, as well as the idea of redemption, it was a very welcome , as Ant  Dec are always the most polished act on BGT and the main reason it’s survived in much better shape than The X Factor.For once, the occasion also got the turn it deserved as well from the Flakefleet Primary School kids, who already had the theatre ­rocking with their Don’t Stop Me Now ­routine.Then they got Ant shoving on the tea trolley to the line: “I’m a rocket ship on my way to Mars, on a ­collision course.”And that’s golden buzzer stuff,ever I’ve seen it.Celebs On The Ranch, Stephen Bailey: “We don’t want anyone shot here.”And BBC continuity introducing New World Order: “Sara ­Pascoe helps Frankie Boyle put the world to rights now.”Although I guess “Five left-wing tosspots sit around agreeing with each other now” hasn’t quite got the same ring to it. Chris Hughton: “We were confident right up until we weren’t.”And Big Ron Atkinson: “It’s the K word isn’t it — Confidence.”Brilliant though the BBC drama is, questions must be asked about Line Of Duty’s OCG , who swan around the place like heavily armed Apprentice candidates, trying to kill anything in a unorm.Their leader, John Corbett, lives in a penthouse.They operate out of a High Street printing shop and a Moss Heath phone box, which works a bit like a see-through Tardis .There’s a female member who dresses up as a nurse to visit DS Jane Cafferty, the injured police officer, and a small boy on a bike who takes the sort of pin-sharp photos that would put every snapper in London to shame.The entire force seems to know who they are, but still hasn’t pulled one of them in for questioning.It could be, of course, they’re waiting for a traffic code violation before things get really serious.The reasons I’m prepared to suspend disbelief, though, are the presence of Stephen Graham – who’s probably heading for all the big awards lists alongside Adrian Dunbar, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, thanks to his captivating performance as Corbett – and the Line Of Duty script which, apart from one slip into “we can do this the easy way or the hard way” territory, has me in the palm of its hand.A happy state of affairs that’s likely to continue, just so long as all this wonderful mayhem and acting doesn’t end with Ted Hastings being uncovered as “H”.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The word platonic derives from the name of which ancient Greek philosopher ”Tom: “Pluto.”The Family Chase, Bradley Walsh: “How many bishops are on the board at the start of a chess game ”Tracy: “One.”And Bradley Walsh: “The Pink Jacket is awarded to the winner of the PGA Grand Slam of what sport ”Tracy: “Wrestling.” Made In Cha gonk Sam Thompson and former MP Louise Mensch were thrown out of a moving helicopter into a freezing Andes lake on Sunday night.Why  Who cares really. Sometimes you’ve just got to enjoy the moment without ruining it by asking too many questions.Officially, though, this was the opening challenge on a celebrity version of SAS: Who Dares Wins, which I’d assumed would be the moment this show lost every last shred of credibility.Until it turned out to be enjoyable and very funny.Miraculously, I also recognised everyone in the line-up apart from some hulking great skinhead, wearing the number  armband, who I thought might be one of Dog The Bounty Hunter’s henchmen, until instructor Ant Middleton called him up for the boxing round with a shout of “Number  . . .  Heather.” And it turned out she was a member of the England women’s rugby team.Slightly more high-profile were the likes of Andrea McLean, Jeff Brazier, Sam Thompson – who’s getting killed the next time he calls Ant “mate” – and name-dropping Louise Mensch, who was the first to quit after sounding like she climaxed during the beasting exercise.The comment of the episode, however, belonged to “Hollywood actor” Jeremy Irvine, who probably had the whole nation reflecting on the debt we all owe our dressing-up box community when he revealed that, no, he hadn’t ever served in the military but he did get “trench foot filming War Horse”.For at the going down of the sun and in the morning, we’ll probably get over it, Jeremy.Snap!

Boy, has she made some mistakes.  But it is still dficult not to feel sorry for her.One of the biggest mistakes she — and the rest of the Cabinet — have made is in misjudging the behaviour of our negotiating opponents. We entered the talks in a very British fashion. Fair play and all that.We assumed the European Union would behave likewise, so as to work out an equable deal which was good for all of us. Ha! Fat chance. Right from the very beginning, the EU officials and politicians made it clear their intention was NOT to work out an equable deal.It was to stuff the UK as thoroughly as possible. Partly to deter other nations from leaving the wretched institution — plenty have grave doubts about it — and partly out of spite.We should have known that right at the beginning. Hell, we had enough warning. Before negotiations began, the repulsive Belgian politician Guy Verhofstadt made it very clear. “Britain has shot itself in the foot,” he said. “We intend to shoot it in the other one.”Meanwhile, Dutch PM Mark Rutte demanded the UK be “brought back down to Earth”, and said Brexit was, “Alice in Wonderland”. Being talked to like that by the pygmy politicians from a small swamp near Germany should have given us the message.  Sadly, it didn’t.All through the negotiations, European Council president Donald Tusk, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier briefed against the British and, in particular, Theresa May.When Mrs May invited half-cut clown Juncker to dinner at Downing Street in April  to begin talks, Juncker described them publicly as, “constructive”. But then he briefed newspapers that Mrs May was, “living in a dferent galaxy” and the meeting had been disastrous.Just a few weeks ago, the Germans were at it. Their Europe minister, Michael Roth, called Brexit a “s***show”. Now we are being lectured by the hilarious Pole, Mr Tusk, that the UK won’t get what it wants unless we, “behave ourselves”.That’s the thanks we get for providing millions of his countrymen with decent jobs that his own government was incapable of providing.Listen, Tusk. Your days are numbered. You are deeply unpopular in your own country because the Poles — good people that they are — have twigged that you are a smug ass, utterly out of touch.  That’s why you’ve lost all those seats recently. You are hated at home and you are hated by us.It’s still not too late for Mrs May’s patience at last to snap and for her to tell these threepenny panjandrums the following: “P*** off! We’ve had enough. We’ve tried to negotiate decently. You’ve behaved like petty tyrants throughout. We’ll leave with no deal, thank you. And you can whistle for your orce bill. So stick it up your Juncker.”But she won’t. We’ll end up not really leaving at all.

Long term eurosceptic Bill Cash tore into Theresa Mayaposs agreement with the EU for an extension until the end of October calling it an abject surrender.Mr Cash, who has consistently voted against the Prime Ministeraposs deal and supports a no deal Brexit , was the first Tory MP to attack the severely weakened Mrs May.It came as the shamefaced Prime Minister ed from Brussels, where EU leaders rejected her bid for a short delay. Mr Cash asked in the Commons in response to the PMaposs statement on the agreed delay: Does my right honorable friend the Prime Minister appreciate the anger that her abject surrender last night has generated across the country  having broken promises  times not to extend the time. She knows what Iaposm saying and sheaposs done that. Does she also accept that this Withdrawal Agreement undermines our democracy, the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, our right to govern ourselves, control over our laws and undermines our national interest.  Will she resign  he bellowed.There was uproar on the Tory benches after his blunt question.And smiling Theresa May said: I think you know the answer to that.The PM has already promised to stand down after her deal passes - but that may now be as late as the end of October. Mrs May replied: First of all I do not recognise the description of the Withdrawal Agreement that he has put before this House. I believe we have negotiated a good deal.    Mrs May spelt out that she had voted three times for a deal that would have meant leaving on  March making particular reference to Sir Bill Cash and the rest of the European Research Group. Sir Bill was one of a number of angry Brexiteer Tories queuing up to attack the Prime Minister.Peter Bone pointed out that the PM had promised that the UK would leave by June .At Prime Ministeraposs Questions on the th march when I asked the Prime Minister why she was seeking to extend Article  having promised  times not to do so, she said aposas Prime Minister I could not consider a delay beyond the  Juneapos, we now have an extension up to the st October.He asked: “How are you going to honour that commitment you gave on March  ” To which the Prime Minister told him: This House and I can honour that commitment by voting for a deal that enables us to leave before the  June.Former Brexit secretary David Davis insisted that no progress had been made in Brussels and that pressure on Mrs May to quit as PM will increase, telling the BBC: I think what is likely to happen is the pressure for her to go will go up. The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically, I suspect, now.  Theresa May admitted the new plan to delay Brexit to October  was a compromise after dficult talks with EU leaders. She boasted she had successfully argued against stringent conditions on the UKaposs continuing membership. And she insisted it was still possible to leave the EU within weeks without having to hold EU elections - as long as MPs finally backed her deal.    Quoting EU chief Donald Tusk, she declared the course of action “will be entirely in the UK’s hands”. This is not the normal way of British politics, she admitted, and it is uncomfortable for many in both the Government and opposition parties. Telling MPs we need to resolve this, she said: This is our national duty as elected members of this House – and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.But Jeremy Corbyn slammed Theresa Mayaposs failure - just three weeks after she solemnly pledged not to delay Brexit beyond June . He said the new delay represents not only a diplomatic failure, it’s another milestone in the government’s mishandling of the entire Brexit process. Mr Corbyn complained the PMaposs latest extension was secured not even at the th hour but at five past midnight, and Britain is now in the “extraordinary situation” of electing MEPs, not knowingthey will take their seats. He declared: The Prime Minister stuck rigidly to a flawed plan and now the clock has run down. Labouraposs leader accused Tory Liam Fox of trying to scupper plans for a customs union by hitting out in a letter to MPs.    And he warned a future Tory leader could usher in a dystopian future where the UK takes hormone-tainted beef in a US trade deal.Despite his attack, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would continue to engage constructively on talks with Tories on the way forward - which resume today.But he warned: The red lines must move and we must see a real compromise. During a fiery QA, Theresa May admitted she had not offered Labour a second referendum on Brexit in the cross-party talks. But she hinted she could fold and back Jeremy Corbynaposs hopes for a softer Brexit with a customs union with the EU. There is more agreement on a customs union than is often given credit for, she said, adding there needed to be compromise on both sides. MPs will set off on an shortened, -day Easter holiday at pm today just hours after EU chief Donald Tusk begged the UK: Please do not waste this time. Downing Street did not rule out speculation that Theresa May could use the break to take a walking holiday.The Prime Minister told MPs: Let us use the opportunity of the Recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swtly on ourafter Easter.And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse.

Out and about in my constituency, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by a growing concern over the issue of pollution – especially among women with small children. Are mums the fighters we’ve been missing in our efforts to save Mother Nature  They were certainly out in force at a recent public meeting about the rebuilding of a local waste incinerator. Their fury about a new threat to the air their children breathe – already polluted by dangerous exhaust fumes – was heartening to behold.   For so long, climate change has felt far away in both time and distance, but London Mayor Sadiq Khan aposs new ultra low emission zonehas forced a broader discussion about the impacts of pollution, especially on the generations who will inherit this planet.They face growing up in a world literally at risk from top to bottom.As David Attenborough ’s wonderful Our Planet series on Netflix has proved, the Earth’s poles are melting at an alarming rate. And it’s not just the poles where the danger lies.This week there was news that two thirds of the glacier ice in the Alps will melt by  – with horrendous  consequences for the environment.   It’s no surprise that this story has been given far less news coverage than Brexit , but it is frustrating.Especially because a lot of the arguments against Brexit – such as ensuring the best opportunities for our children and protecting jobs – are even more relevant when it comes to climate change. A decade ago, I worked for an organisation doing research on how we should be tackling it. The organisation was regarded as “hippy”, middle class, and out of touch with everyday le. Policy strategists used to dismiss me as soon as I said I worked there, but it turns out they should have been paying closer attention. A decade later, the Green New Deal my colleagues were working on is now being championed by America’s rising Democrat star  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This represents a sht of radical climate policy from the backwaters to the forefront of change. Progress is being made, but there is always still the massive sticking point of money. While mums with small kids want to stop air pollution, London drivers complain about the ULEZ charge. Yet it’s a price that needs to be paid somehow. For small businesses and working class families, generous scrappage schemes and improved public transport are mustswe are to deliver not just climate action, but climate justice. And the fight to tackle it must start in the everyday lives of ordinary people – like those mothers battling for their children’s future.

The Shadow Home Secretary urged the government to refuse US attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder. She said there should be protection afforded to those who take personal risk to disclose wrongdoing where that disclosure serves the public interest. Speaking in the House of Commons, she said: The reason we are debating this this afternoon is entirely to do with the whistleblowing activities of Julian Assange and Wikileaks. It is this whistleblowing activity into illegal wars, mass murder, murder of civilians and corruption on a grand scale that has put Julian Assange in the crosshairs of the US administration. It is for this reason that they have once more issued an extradition warrant against Mr Assange.    She noted Mr Assangeaposs repeated complaint that he was being unlawfully detained as he could not leave the embassy without being arrested. And she said the Foreign Office had said a UN ruling which came down on Assangeaposs side had not changed anything.Ms Abbot also reminded ministers of the case of Gary McKinnon, in which Theresa May intervened to refuse an extradition request from the US over hacking allegations.She added: Julian Assange is not being pursued to protect US national security, he is being pursued because he has exposed wrongdoing by US administrations and their military forces. And we only have to look at the treatment of Cha Manning to see what awaits himheaposs extradited to the US.    Additionally, the Mirror understands a series of suggested questions for Home Secretary Sajid Javid were circulated to Labour MPs ahead of his statement to the Commons - all of which raised concerns about Mr Assangeaposs arrest and extradition. They included comparisons with Gary McKinnon and the delays to the extradition of people allegedly involved in the Rwandan genocide. One questioned the legality of the revocation of asylum by Ecuador. Mr Javid thanked the Ecuadorian government for deciding to bring to an end Assangeaposs presence inside its embassy in London. Mr Javid told the Commons: I am pleased that President Moreno has taken this decision and I extend the UKaposs thanks to him for resolving this situation. Ecuadoraposs actions recognise that the UK criminal justice system is one in which rights are protected, and in which, contrary to what Mr Assange and his supporters may claim, he and his legitimate interests will be protected. Mr Javid thanked the politan Police for its professionalism in dealing with the immediate situation and during the last seven years. He said: Both the UK Government and the Ecuadorian government have become increasingly concerned about the state of Mr Assangeaposs health. The first action of the police following the arrest was to have him medically assessed and deemed fit to detain. The Ecuadorians have made their best efforts to ensure that doctors, chosen by him, have had access inside the embassy, and while he remains in the custody of the UK we are now in a position to ensure access to all necessary medical facilities. Mr Javid confirmed extradition papers must be received by the judge within  days, and any extradition request would have to be sanctioned by the Home Office.

Paula Hudgell, , said that the serious case review, published today, highlighted a string of red flags which multiple agencies failed to act on - from the time Tony was still in his motheraposs womb. She said: I am disappointed that bits have been glossed over. I had to fight for this review to take place. Because Tony did not die it was not said to be aposserious enough.apos But why do we have to wait until a child dies - or loses his legs - until we are ready to learn lessons     The report shows that multiple red flags were missed - from the time that Tony was still in his mumaposs womb and she was with police on bail for drugs offences with Tonyaposs dad. The ambulance and housing officers noted drug use around their home. Assessments were delayed or did not happen on time. If the services had picked up on the danger Tony was in even one day sooner he may still have his legs today. Time is critical when youaposre dealing with child cruelty and neglect and I believe that the system failed him.  Now every dayaposs a struggle for Tony as he tries to adapt to le without legs. But I hope that through implementing the learnings identied in this report, other children will be better protected in the future. Police were first alerted to little Tony Hudgellaposs existence when his pregnant mother was on bail for drugs offences with Tonyaposs father in April, . No pre-birth assessment was recorded. His father, Tony Smith, had a  year history of drug abuse but there was no evidence of a risk assessment into his drug use.    In June, , after Tonyaposs pregnant mother, Jody Simpson, was seen by a GP the couple were referred to childrenaposs social work services , but the referral was not received until August  - after an unexplained three month delay. Critically, although concerned professionals called for a parenting assessment for little Tony, it was not arranged before the six-week-old baby was admitted to hospital with catastrophic injuries on November , . Although ious professionals - including the ambulance and housing officers - observed potential risk factors ike active drug misuse in Tonyaposs surroundings, this information was not shared with social services. Tony Smith had a conviction for domestic abuse against a previous partner and multiple theft and drug offences.  Tonyaposs mother, who was  years younger than Tonyaposs father, was noted as being apostimidapos by authorities in the report, yet no further investigations were carried out at the time. The report noted that her timidity and the age gap could have been cause for further assessment. And further assessment could have revealed the danger little Tony was in at home. The anonymised review, published today by the Kent Safegaurding Children Board under the name Child J, recommended better inter-agency communication in future to better protect vulnerable children. Tonyaposs parents were jailed for  years. A JustGiving page has been launched to ensure little Tony has all the equipment he needs. You can donate here.

Research also revealed polite guests should always use a coaster when setting their drink down and always put the toilet seat down. Steering clear of private areas of the house, not swearing in the presence of your host and sitting down at the table without washing your hands also made the list. Leaving your host to do the washing up is also considered aposrudeapos.    Richard Sinclair MBE, executive director of connectivity at Virgin Media, said: “Wherever we are, whatever we are doing, we always have the urge to stay online. “When visiting friends and family, research has shown that asking for the WiFi code is one of the first things people do. “As is courtesy when visiting someone ’s home, you should be mindful and always respect their rules to avoid any awkward situations.“ The study also revealed while  per cent said there aren’t any particular rules they have which a guest must follow, those that do said it’s just a matter of aposrespectapos.

And one in  adults have gone to the extreme of refusing to hand out their WiFi password, reasoning ‘they’ve come for a visit, not to sit glued to their device’.    If homeowners are to give out their WiFi password, they believe guests should wait for up to  minutes before asking, according to research carried out among , adults.

Kevin Simmonds, , was in excruciating pain for hours on end after hospital staff told him there were no surgeons available to operate. He was then advised to go to another emergency department. He was taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital on Friday afternoon after chopping the ends of his digits off. Gruesome images show chunks of flesh hanging off from his three fingers, leaving Mr Simmonds in excruciating pain.    After waiting in the AE for six hours, he was told he needed a specialist to operate on him and was forced to travel  miles across the border to England. At around pm, Mr Simmonds arrived at the Countess of Chester Hospital only to hear the devastating news that it was too late to perform surgery. Instead, nurses applied dressing on his wound and gave him paracetamol to combat the pain. He was then sent home and was given another surgery slot four days later on Tuesday. Mr Simmonds said: It was the last cut of the day on Friday and stupidly I took my eye off the blade for a split second.    I left the blade running - it was a stupid mistake. I accidentally mashed up the ends of three fingers with a  inch table saw running a mm wide ripsaw blade. It was incredibly painful but I didnapost panic. I just did what I could and wrapped a white shirt around it. I must have looked like something out of Game of Thrones. I got to the Maelor and said I was in a lot of pain. They put me through triage and an hour or so later they loosely applied three pieces of wet gauze to the wounds. An hour later I had an X-ray, but by pm I was being offered two paracetamol for the pain and being told to go to Chester because no-one in Wrexham could treat it. Mr Simmonds said they even used the wrong bandage for his fingers, and sat at home with an open wound for three days.    He added: They didnapost even have the right stuff, they had put a bandage on my hand that was meant for legs. They had told me at Wrexham there was no damage to the bone but at Chester they said there was. I got to Chester and thought there was no need to wait in reception but had to wait two more hours until eventually they said they knew someone was coming down with a saw injury. The X-ray hadnapost come through from Wrexham so they had to take another one, despite Wrexham assuring me they had sent it. Eventually they said it was too late then to do any surgery on it so put the correct dressing on and finger gauze. It was about five days after my injury that my hand was finally stitched up. This is a first-world country and something like that should have been sorted in a shorter time. Iaposve effectively sat here for three days with an open wound. A Wrexham Maelor Hospital spokesperson said: To clary, this specialist surgery isnapost provided at Wrexham Maelor Hospital which is why someone with this type of injury would be treated before being referred.

She was only meant to be working in the morningsbut she stayed until after pm to make sure that a man who was being discharged had provisions from a food bank and tokens for a new fridge.    He continued: Needless to say, she cheerfully brushed aside any concerns for herself as she was determined to do everything she could for this patient. Another story highlighted how she spent all day with a patient who could only communicate through blinking. Following her passing, the hospital have decided to set up an award for Foundation Year doctors in her name.    Dr Lewis added: Over the last year— during the time when Steph worked with us — we have engaged with staff from all backgrounds to agree our trustaposs values.

She weighed kg when brought in – less than half of what a healthy seal pup should – and was close to death.    Now, swimming out to join a seal colony in her natural habitat, Gnasher is one of the lucky ones. “It is tiring,” Sea Le aquarist Cody Townsend says, “but it is worth it when you see a healthy pup being released back into the wild like Gnasher.” Sadly, many more are not so fortunate – and an increasing number are being injured due to plastic pollution. Horric pictures of seal pups show some brought in with their heads stuck in frisbees, with plastic coffee cups stuck on their snouts or tangled in the string of balloons. Boat skipper Derek Dewson has run seal watching trips  years and he is upset and angry about the increasing amounts of rubbish he finds dumped by tourists and locals alike.    “Frisbees are a huge problem and we are seeing more of it” he says. “As the seal pops its head out of the water, it becomes telescopic, so its neck narrows and it is easy for the frisbee to go over its head and get stuck.” Just this morning, on a -minute sweep of the beach, he picked up two buckets of rubbish – plastic bottles, coffee cups, crisps packets and burst helium balloons. He adds: “People don’t realisethey dump plastic it can stay in the sea for years – I have found crisp packets that are dated . It is not unusual for me to pick up  cups on the marsh on one walk. “I really think they should stop the sale of plastic products in this area to protect marine le.”    At first glance, that protection seems unnecessary. Out at nearby Blakeney Point, we watched as the beautul seals basked on the shoreline. It is a moving scene of natural beauty – until you look closer and see one of them has a fishing net fastened tight around its neck. Staff at the seal hospital try everything to help the animals but sometimes it is not enough. They fought for a week to save another seal named Stitch found with severe neck wounds caused by fishing wire – but infection had set in. Cody, , says: “If a pup gets something stuck around its neck, as it starts to grow whatever it is gets tighter and tighter, effectively strangling them. “Stitch came in a month ago with fishing wire around her neck – it was so tight it had cut into the flesh, two inches deep. We had to cut the wire off just so she could breathe. “If a seal does have something around its neck it can’t feed properly so it becomes malnourished and dehydrated. They can’t interact with other seals so sometimes they get bitten and bullied out of the colony.”    Last year, the sanctuary had  calls. Every year, eight million tonnes of plastic enters the sea and it is feared by  there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. A recent study found every creature washed up on our shores had traces of plastic in its stomach, showing the huge scale of pollution. This has heartbreaking consequences but the battle is not lost. As we head back to shore, Cody spots an identity tag on a basking seal – meaning a pup they rescued is now a healthy adult back with its colony. It is sights like this that make their work worthwhile.    At the hospital, staff are working to treat the seals in their care. Toto is a one-year-old brought in a day ago and so sick he is tube-fed so he gets enough nutrients. Marine biologist Hollie Stephenson says: “When he was found he was severely dehydrated and lethargic, meaning he was in danger of attack from other seals or dogs. But he is a good weight so we are hopeful he will recover and be released soon.”    Pup Jonny was found in February and had nasty infected cuts thought to be from an attack from an older seal or even a dog. But she is now on the road to recovery and staff are hopeful that, like Gnasher, she will soon be ready to go back to her colony. It costs about £, to treat every seal and the vast majority are released once they reach full health and a weight of kg. But there are rare cases when the seals are found to have medical conditions so severe they would not survive in the wild.    Miley was brought to the Sea Le centre seven years ago, after being found malnourished. She was so young her umbilical cord was still attached. But despite the care she got, she struggled to gain weight and tests found a thyroid condition. Miley needs daily medication, so she is now a resident at the centre. She is about to moved to a foster home at the new state-of-the-art Sea Le centre in Birmingham, to free up pens in the seal hospital for the expected influx during the pup season. In the season, staff feed the pups every four hours – as with a newborn baby. Cody says: “It is only in extreme cases like Miley’s where we wouldn’t release a seal back into the wild. “Our aim is get them well enough to release them to their natural habitat.” "},{"url":null,"title":"julian assange smeared poo over","story":"NewsJulian Assange smeared poo over walls of Ecuadorian Embassy in LondonBefore his arrest the Australian WikiLeaks found engaged in \"discourteous and aggressive behaviour\" in the embassy where he has lived for seven yearsShareCommentsByGerard Couzens:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video julian-assange-arrested-wikileaks-founder-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Julian Assange smeared poo over the walls of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London before he was hauled out of his seven-year-old hideaway, it has been claimed.The revelation was made by Ecuador’s Interior Minister after the Wikileaks founder was dramatically arrested by British police officers today. The country’s president Lenin Moreno accused the Australian of “discourteous and aggressive behaviour” as he confirmed the south American country had withdrawn Assange’s asylum status. Rafael Correa, Ecuadorian president when Assange was granted asylum, branded Moreno a traitor. But the country’s Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo hit back by claiming Correa had allowed the -year-old to get away with some unimaginable behaviour.  She said: “During his stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy, during the government of the former president Rafael Correa, they tolerated things like Mr Assange putting feces on the walls of the embassy and other types of behaviour of this kind that is far removed from the minimum respect a guest should have in a country which has generously welcomed him.” She did not make it clearhe had used his own poo or someone ’s. Assange, sporting a scruffy beard and unkempt hair, was dragged out of the embassy in handcuffs by a group of seven men after his asylum status was withdrawn.  Prosecutor James Hines told the court that Assange barged past police officers who had to call in back up to help restrain him. He said: In December  the US requested his provisional arrest to be extradited to the USA. Officers arrived at the embassy at .am and was greeted by the Ambassador who revoked his asylum. At am the officers tried to introduce themselves but he barged past them to go to his private room. He resisted their arrest and they struggled to restrain him and called for assistance. He had to be lted out of the building. He said it was unlawful and he wouldnapost leave. He was lted into a police van and taken to West End Central Police Station where he was arrested and charged.  He is facing up to  months in a British jail after being found guilty this afternoon at Westminster Magistrates Court of skipping bail in  to seek refuge at the embassy over rape allegations which led to Sweden requesting his arrest. He now faces a battle against extradition to America where he is wanted for espionage and publication of sensitive government documents. His lawyers fear he will face the death penalty, a claim rubbished today by President Moreno who said Britain had confirmed it would not extradite Assange to a country where he could face the death sentence. Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Jose Valencia said after the arrest: “Great Britain has offered guarantees thata third country presented an extradition request, Mr Assange would not be handed over to any nation that could impose the death penalty or where he could be subjected to torture.” "},{"url":null,"title":"primary pupils given friday afternoons","story":"NewsPrimary pupils given Friday afternoons off as they lack focus by end of weekA school in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire is allowing  schoolchildren to go home three hours early at lunchtime in an apparent bid to help their educationShareCommentsBySam Rkaina:,  APR NewsNeyland Community School will allow pupils home early at the end of the week \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA school is giving  children every Friday afternoon off - because tired pupils lack focus by the end of the week. The primary school pupils are set to get that Friday feeling when they are able to leave the school gates at .pm. School bosses say the youngsters lack attention and focus on Friday afternoons after a full week of classes. And they say it is not to save money like other schools which shut early - but to help the childrenaposs education. A letter was sent out to parents which claims the early finish could improve greater family time. The changes at Neyland Community School in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, will start in September . The -pupil school currently closes at .pm on Fridays. It hopes the early finish will further raise standards and improve outcomes for learners across the school. One mum said: it is a really good idea - I know that by Friday afternoon the kids are burnt out and donapost take anything in. But another dad fumed: This is ridiculous. Both my we and I work so this will mean one of us having to take Fridays off too to look after our kids.    A spokeswoman for Pembrokeshire County Council said: The main reason for the schools wanting to implement these changes is to further raise standards and improve outcomes for learners across the school. This will be achieved by increased professional learning to up skill the whole workforce – in line with the new National Mission for Wales and New Curriculum. We want to establish a culture of inquiry, innovation and exploration where teaching approaches and interventions used in class are research and evidence based on an on-going basis. This is a change to existing arrangements. The intention is not to give teachers an afternoon off as has been mistakenly suggested by some. Teachers will have no change in their current contracted working hours – just in the way they work them. “If we cannot utilise Friday afternoons in this way then teachers will be end up being regularly taken out of class for training. Naturally this results in disruption for the children and supply teacher costs, both of which we really want to avoid. “This is a schools’ initiative which we wish to see implemented because we see real benefits for the children by improving their learning experiences and making them the best that they can be.” The Welsh Government said opening hours were a matter for schools and governing bodies. A spokesman said: Schools must fully consult before making any changes, ensuring that the number of teaching hours are not being compromised and that the curriculum is being delivered in its entirety.

Their lives are intertwined with the very fabric of Britain - the everyday working man and woman who pay their taxes and fund the le of luxury the royals inhabit. The same people are interested in their lives and the lives of the royal family who have been born into great privilege. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have in the last few days moved into their luxurious new home, Frogmore Cottage after a complete renovation costing the taxpayer a reported £million.  And while I respect Meghan for forging her own path, choosing how she wants to approach royal le, surely a brief photo call and a wave to their fans who camp out wouldn’t have been too much to ask  The couple split with Kensington Palace and the Cambridges will mean more staff and more attention on them as they build their global brand with the help of American billionaires media moguls such as Oprah Winfrey - all of which is funded by the British people. They are not celebrities who can choose when and where to turn off the world’s attention by disappearing for a year or two, especially when they use the attention their advantage when launching personal causes on their record breaking Instagram account. I do worry that the level of control Harry and Meghan are trying to assert over ever facet of their le will cause them more harm than good in the long run.    Why Harry and Meghan are right By Eva Simpson With just a few weeks – it could even be days for all we know – before the birth of their first child, Harry and Meghan have sensibly decided not to follow in the footsteps of Wills and Kate and will instead keep their baby news private “until they have celebrated as a family”. Good on them. They will have to share their child with the rest world for the rest of his or her le. So who could blame them for wanting to stay in a cocoon for a long as possible  The Duchess of Cambridge probably didn’t have much choice in the matter, as her first child, Prince George is heir to the throne, and once you’ve done it with one, you’re kind of stuck. But every time I saw her tottering on her kitten heels outside St Mary’s hospital Paddington – not a hair out of place, just hours after giving birth, I felt nothing but pity. I’ve been through labour twice, one was a natural birth, the other a C-Section, and like most parents all I wanted to do was bond with my babies and sleep. The idea that I’d have to have my hair and make-up done and pose for photographs before I’ve even grappled with the basics of breast feeding makes me shiver. So let Harry and Meghan enjoy their precious few hours and days alone with their baby. I’m happy to wait to see the pictures – after all don’t all babies look the same anyway  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather britain set bathe","story":"NewsUK weather: Britain set to bathe in sizzling temperatures for Easter weekendThe mercury is set to rise for much of the UK for the bumper Easter weekend with high pressure bringing warmer air from Monday according to forecastersShareCommentsByBrett Gibbons:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video latest-forecast-sun-coming-uk-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Bring out the barbecue because Britain is set to be bathed in welcome warmer air for the Easter holiday weekend.It won’t be wall-to-wall sunshine and there is a risk of showers, but there will be a noticeable increase in temperatures following the chill of this week.

Baker Roth, one, has Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome– a rare overgrowth disorder that causes his tongue to swell to an abnormally large size. He urgently needed surgery to remove the growth in order to prevent his jaw from becoming deformed. Now, doctoraposs managed to remove half of his tongue allowing him to eat, talk and breathe much more easily. His mother, Farrah Roth, from Jenks, Oklahoma, initially thought he was acting cute and poking his tongue out in the ultrasound scans. Farrah said: “I always thought it was cute that he had his tongue sticking out in ultrasound scans, but realistically it was macroglossia caused by BWS.    “Not a lot of doctors are familiar with the syndrome and we just thought it was adorable, I even posted about how cute it was. “It shocks me seeing his pictures before as I never thought about how big his tongue used to be. “I was like ‘wow, that’s a big tongue’, I was so used to it that it never bothered me but looking back it was definitely large.    “He smiles a lot more, it’s a dferent kind smile and good to see his little face light-up, he’s beginning to look more like a toddler. “We are able to let him have larger foods now like crackers or cut-up hamburger, which he puts in his mouth himself. “People believe he looks so much dferent to how he did before. “I’m really happy with the way it’s turned out, we are shocked by how much better it is and his tongue looks really good. “He’s relearning how to drink, eat and communicate correctly, so is having to learn everything all over again.  “I’m so ready to hear him talk now, he is currently using language more to communicate and is trying to walk. “It’s been a long time coming, we are teaching him to work his mouth, when he says ‘mommy’ and ‘daddy’ it will be the happiest time for us.” Doctors were able to see his tongue overgrowth during his -week scan. Baker was delivered eight-weeks early via an emergency c-section, weighing lb oz. The toddler was also diagnosed with a rare cancer on his stomach, known as hepatoblastoma, which affects two in one million people.  He underwent five months of chemotherapy and resection surgery, and was put in remission last year October. Farrah added: “I was never afraid that he would die, I took it day by day and went into a dferent mental mode. “We were so relieved to find out that Baker was in remission, it was a heavy weight lted from us, but unfortunately in the back of your head you always fear it can . “It will be exciting to explain to him where his scars came from when he gets older, BWS kids seem to be very happy and strong little fighters.” Bakeraposs family have started a fundraiser to cover the cost of his medical bills, which are expected to mount up to more than US  million.

She was walking down for lunch when she first realised something was wrong. Amy said: “I was walking down for lunch and started hearing some commotion. We looked outside the window and I thought it was a fight. It was only when her basketball coach, Dave Sanders, told her there was a shooting that she realised how serious it was. He told Amy and her friends that they needed to get away from the window and she said he saved our lives. She added: I ran as fast as I could underneath a table. I could hear bombs going off and screams.  When the gunmen started coming in to shoot is when I ran. We ran out that front entrance door and we were being shot at as we ran. But the trauma was far from over for Amy. On her daughteraposs first day at preschool, she collapsed in the car park. She admits she thought it was a heart attack. Amy said: The doctor askedI ever had a panic attack. Could any trigger have caused this  I said I just dropped my daughter off at school, and Iaposm a Columbine survivor. Iaposve worked hard on my trauma. Iaposm in a place where I want to share my story because I own my story. Amanda StairaposI believed I was going to dieapos Amanda Stair, , hid under a table in the library, where the teenage shooters killed  students and took their own lives. She could only see one of the shooters from the waist down but that sight chilled her. The gunman had a gun strapped to his leg and she admits she was absolutely terried. Amanda said: They just kept walking around and shooting for what felt like forever. I heard an explosion directly to my right, where I knew that another girl was hiding. My ears started ringing, and I knew that I was next, I had to be. I put my arms over my head with my elbows facing forward.  I squeezed into a ball as tightly as I could. I held my breath and closed my eyes. I waited for a gunshot to rip through my ribs, but it never came. She says it sounded like the two shooters, Eric and Dylan, were having the time of their lives. Amanda added they were making comments about blowing up the library and commenting on the kids they had shot. She added: I heard one of them say, ‘Don’t worry about it, you’re all going to be dead in a few minutesapos. I believed what they said. Why shouldn’t I  For all I knew everyone in the library was dead. “Emotionally, I shut down. I went numb. I learned that when something is really serious and going down, I can become coldly logical.” Austin BanksaposI became an addictapos Austin Eubanks was hit by two bullets and saw his best friend killed right in front of him. He had just walked into the library when a teacher followed him in and shouted for all the students to get under tables. Then the shooters walked in. Austin said: They went pretty methodically from section to section, coming to ours last. Following his ordeal Austin was prescribed opiates and other medication to help him cope with the trauma.  He said: The predominant emotion is anger. After a tragedy like this, thereaposs a tendency to withdraw or detach emotion whenever emotion is dficult. People find a way to medicate. I chose substances. “But I finally found the courage to do whatever it took, and I stayed in treatment for  consecutive months to resolve the underlying trauma, the survivoraposs guilt, and to live a le that wasnapost controlled by substances.” Chad LaughlinaposShooters were my friendsapos Chad Laughlin, , was a childhood friend of one of the shooters, Dylan Klebold. He passed him in the car park three minutes before the shooting began. Chad said: “I was pretty much in denial, emotionally, for six or seven years. I knew Dylan and Eric better than most people - particularly Dylan. And that weighs heavily, obviously. “I had a bit of therapy in the beginning but I didn’t feel like there was really anyone that could handle it.  I think that the whole community is traumatised, and I don’t think that anyone is fully healed. He admits he still suffers from survivoraposs guilt, along with many of his circle of friends. Chad said: I don’t think it will ever go away. It comes up every day in our thought processes. I might go the whole day without thinking about it, and then I will drive by a aposRespect Leapos license plate, and I’ll snap right back into it.” Mark TayloraposIaposve forgiven themapos Mark Taylor, , was shot and left for dead on the lawn of Columbine High School. He said: ”The emotional trauma was probably the worst part of it for me. Not understanding what happened, why they would just shoot me. Seeing my family have a hard time with it. There was some bitterness at first. But God has worked with me on that. Iaposve had great opportunities. But amazingly, he has forgiven the two shooters, even though they tried to kill him. Mark said: So many people let their past hold them back. They’re victims, and then they go out and do something to someone  because they have unforgiveness and bitterness.” Patrick IrelandaposI was determined not to let them winapos Patrick Ireland, , was blasted twice in the head but dragged himself to the library window and fell from the first floor to safety. Now a married father-of-three, Patrick told the Daily Mirror how he fought back to strong physical and mental health. He said: “We were all shot fairly early on in the library. We heard their shots and the throwing of pipe bombs as they got closer. It was harrowing. “After I was shot, I blacked out and was unconscious through most of the mayhem. It was a blessing in disguise. It saved me from a lot of traumatic memories.  “Those of us who choose to be victors can achieve the goals we set out for ourselves. You have to believe that tough times don’t last, but tough people do. “I was so determined not to let my shooters win. I believe the world is still good at heart. People need to hold on to that. “Evil will not win. There are too many good people in the world. Alisha BasoreaposThereaposs still a deep, dark holeapos Alisha Basore, , who works in a hair salon, ran away from her high school building when the shootings began. Her best friend Rachel Scott was killed. She says she has managed to move on - and tries not to dwell on what happened. Alisha said: There’s still this deep, dark hole I can crawl back into when asked to go there. “I don’t sit at home and dwell on it. But when my clients find out I went to Columbine, it’s the same questions: ‘Were you there ’ ‘What did you see ’” Craig ScottaposI used to fantasise about revengeapos Craig Scott played dead during the shootings at Columbine High School, but two friends Isaiah Shoels and Matthew Kechter, were killed right next to him. As he ran from the school he had an ominous feeling about his elder sister Rachel. She was one of the first students killed. Craigaposs family later set up a nonprofit organisation, Rachelaposs Challenge, to inspire students and have since shared Rachelaposs story with  million people. Craig said: “The days right after, youaposre in so much shock. You could ask me a question, and I could just sit there, looking at you, because I felt like Iaposm not even there.  I used to fantasise what it would be like to get revenge on the shooters. If I had just five minutes alone, what Iaposd do to them. And it started to eat me up. “My family, in the months to come, started to feel a sense of purpose and mission with telling Rachelaposs story. And that, as we saw it, that was having an impact, that was part of our hope. “I think my storyaposs a real eye-opener for some students going through a hard time. They can look at me and tell me, aposI saw that you went through this, and look, you made something good out of it. I can get through what Iaposm going through’. I talk to them about forgiveness and letting go, and howthey donapost, it can really imprison their heart.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits would happily give up","story":"NewsBrits would happily give up their best friend for £,, study findsDo you love your bestie like a family member or would you be willing to ditch them for the right price ShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsHow much would it cost for you to break up with your bestie \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf someone offered you money to give up your best friend forever, would you do it  And how much would it cost to ruin your friendship  Weaposre probably talking pretty big numbers right  After all this is your BFF weaposre talking about, they know all your dirty secrets.

These pictures show the remains of the -metrebronze age wooden boat, thought to date back to around  BC that was found  metresoff the coast near the city of Antalya in southern Turkeyaposs Antalya Province. The boat, which contained . tonnes of copper ingots, was found by frogmen researchers from Antalya Universityaposs Underwater Research Department. Archaeologist Hakan Oniz said: From the typology of the bullion, we determined the shipwreck was one of the merchant vessels of the th century BC.    We have broken fresh ground in underwater archaeology thanks to these findings. Researchers determined the amount of bullion on board by carrying out three-dimensional scans of the shipwreck via sonar surveys, photographic mosaic and photo-scanning. Preliminary research suggests the copper came from mines on the island of Cyprus and was being transported to Aegean shores or the island of Crete when the boat sank. Mr Oniz said the boat could well be the oldest trade ship ever discovered.    He added: It was probably caught in the middle of a storm while travelling to the Aegean region from Cyprus. It was carrying a cargo of copper bullion and the type of that bullion helped us date the ship. He said the university now planned to form a team with local and international experts for a five-year project to further investigate the wreck. Antalya Governor Munir Karaloglu said the discovery was groundbreaking, describing it as the aposGobekli Tepeapos of the underwater world.  Gobekli Tepe, an archaeological site in southern Turkeyaposs Sanliurfa Province, includes the worldaposs oldest known temple which predates Stonehenge by , years. Mr Karaloglu said artacts from the shipwreck would be carefully removed and eventually put on display at a new museum in the Kemer district of Antalya Province. The Uluburun shipwreck, also found off the shores of Antalya Province, dating back to  BC, was previously believed to be the worldaposs oldest known shipwreck. If confirmed, the new shipwreck will also be older than a ,-year-old Greek merchant ship found off Bulgariaaposs Black Sea coast last year which has been described as the worldaposs oldest known intact shipwreck."},{"url":null,"title":"bear serving life sentence human","story":"NewsBear serving a le sentence in human prison alongside  dangerous criminalsEkaterina is the only prisoner to have a swimming pool in her cell at the jail in KazakhstanShareCommentsByWill Stewart:,  APR NewsEkaterina is the only inmate serving a le sentence \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brown bear is serving a le sentence in prison alongside  dangerous offenders.

Shocking pictures show how he now has only gums and two teeth left in his mouth with stitches to stop bleeding from where the teeth were pulled out. The boyaposs mother, Supatra Tumklin, blamed soy milk for the state of Nongaposs teeth - and said she had given up cleaning them.    She said: Iaposm very inexperienced in raising a child. He once had stomach flu when he was aged one and the doctor told me to give him soy milk instead. So, I did and continued to feed him drink with a milk bottle. After changing the milk type, I saw that his teeth were having more and more yellow stains. I tried to wipe it off but he didnapost let me.    The mother reportedly gave up cleaning the childaposs teeth because brushing caused bleeding. She also believed that the decay would be harmless because the teeth would be replaced by adult molars. Supatra added: I thought that it would be fine because the permanent teeth would replace them anyway. But I realised that I was very wrong when I saw all of his teeth were almost gone.  Dentist Sathian Suravisankul warned parents to ensure they take proper care of their childrenaposs teeth as even rotten teeth could lead to gum infections and permanent damage. He said: The reason why I decided to remove the boyaposs  teeth was because he had a constant toothache all over his mouth. There is no other way to cure the pain except to take out all the decays. Sathian added: I would like to tell all the parents out there to take care of your childaposs baby teeth because they are as important as our permanent teeth. Not only they are crucial for chewing, they also help develop the physical, emotional, and IQ of the child.

Bosses at Trinity College Dublin have been alerted to the alleged poisoning plot and are investigating. The Irish Mirror reports that a substance was allegedly found by a female student who shares a house with the male suspect. The property is not believed to be on the campus. A source told the paper: “Trinity College authorities have been informed of the matter.  “Gardai are not investigating at this time, they have not been called in by the college as yet. “This is a frightening incident and it is believed the alleged victims are trying to decide whether they want to make a statement or not.” Trinity College authorities are understood to be carrying out an investigation as the case involves the safety of students. The student is thought to be in the second year of a course. A source said: “The suspect is alleged to have attempted to poison his housemates using bleach in a coffee machine. “His ‘plot’ was uncovered and he was confronted by the female student. “It is claimed he has admitted what he did to the housemates - and allegedly claimed that he had done something similar in the past.” The source added that the girl who found the bleach is now ‘too scared toto college’ as the suspect has not yet been expelled.

The -year-old was arrested after Ecuador withdrew asylum this morning. He had been holed up in the embassy in posh Knightsbridge for years, initially to avoid being extradited to Sweden to face allegations of sexual offences. Assange fears he could be extradited to face charges in the US, where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks. Hereaposs what you need to know. Who is Julian Assange  The Australian spearheaded the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks to expose the inner workings of governments, military and trade deals around the world. He is a hacker, freedom of information advocate and considers himself a political refugee. Born in Queensland, Australia in , Assange attended the cityaposs Central university where he studied programming, mathematics and physics. He has a software designer son called Daniel with ex-we Teresa.    What did Julian Assange do  Assange had sex with two women he met at a conference in Sweden in August . They accused the dad of rape and, though he was questioned, Assange was never charged over the claims. Heaposs always denied them. But Interpol issued a Red Notice for Assangeaposs arrest in November  and he gave himself up one week later. The hacker then appeared before a judge in Westminster, where his supporters stumped up £, for his bail. But in June , Swedish prosecutors called for him to be extradited - a measure his lawyers opposed in case he was sent to the US.    Days later he fled bail and applied for asylum in Ecuador, through the embassy in Knightsbridge, London. The Ecuadorian authorities stated he could remain in the embassy as long as he wished, and Assange was granted political asylum in August of that year. But his hopes were dashed in February last year when Westminster Magistrates Court ruled to uphold Scotland Yardaposs warrant for his arrest. Ecuador closed off Assangeaposs communications with the outside world in March that year. In July  last year, it was reported Ecuadoraposs president said Assange must eventually leave the embassy. In November, , the US Department of Justice inadvertently named Assange in a court document which suggests the WikiLeaks founder may have been charged in secret.  Why was WikiLeaks founder arrested  Police arrested Assange on the warrant issued by Westminster Magistratesapos Court back in June  for failing to surrender to the court. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: Julian Assange, , has today, Thursday  April, been arrested by officers from the politan Police Serviceat the Embassy of Ecuador, Hans Crescent, SW on a warrant issued by Westminster Magistratesapos Court on  June , for failing to surrender to the court. He has been taken into custody at a central London police station where he will remain, before being presented before Westminster Magistratesapos Court as soon as is possible. The MPS had a duty to execute the warrant, on behalf of Westminster Magistratesapos Court, and was invited into the embassy by the Ambassador, following the Ecuadorian governmentaposs withdrawal of asylum. WikiLeaks tweeted: URGENT: Ecuador has illigallyterminated Assange political asylum in violation of international law. He was arrested by the British police inside the Ecuadorian embassy minutes ago.

The results haven’t come at times but the performances are getting better and we have to take that positive because that is what will get us the wins.”Butcher does concede what must be added to encouraging displays like the one on Friday is a ruthless touch in front of goal.Since November, United have not won a league game by more than a one-goal margin and having to defend slender leads finally caught up with them against County.“Ultimately we have to kill teams off when we’re on top.

We didn’t do that on Friday and % we have paid the price. We said that in the dressing-room after the game.“After we’ve gone ahead we had a couple of great chances before half-time and second half when we were breaking on them we had a few more.“We have to start taking them because you can’t be putting yourself in a situation again and again where you have to hang on in games you should be winning by a few goals because you’ve dominated.“There are always going to be stages in games where you have to defend and it’s important you make the most of the periods when you’re on top and we are having plenty.”While he accepts the play-offs are now likely, so long as it is mathematically possible to finish first, he will not give up the chase.EvenCounty can’t be caught it’s important United play well and win the next four games.“Friday night is a massive game against Ayr because we could end up playing them in the play-offs.“We want to make sure we finish second and three points on Friday would be a big step towards that.“We need to keep in touch with Ross County because they are going to drop points.

As the brand new musical stage production enjoys its world premiere at the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh, we uncover some interesting local facts about the iconic film.Famed for its stunning landscapes and best-selling soundtrack, the movie showcased Pennan and Banff at its best, from its seascapes to its people. Now the iconic film, which starred Hollywood names and rising Scottish stars, has been adapted for the stage for the first time – almost four decades since the original movie was made. Bill Forsyth and Mark Knopfler have teamed up with David Greig and John Crowley to create the magical theatre production of Local Hero, showing at Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh until May .For more information and to book tickets, click here. Just before you dash off to book your seats, here are a few Local Hero facts Evening Express uncovered that you may not know: vw, px\"  Harbourmaster Baden Gibson pictured above starred as an extra in Local Hero alongside Burt Lancaster and Peter Capaldi. Mr Gibson was harbourmaster for  years until he passed away at the age of  in November . He spent his entire le in Pennan and became the village’s longest-standing resident, when his mother moved away. After being cast as an extra in the film, Baden campaigned for Pennan to be used in more TV and film productions. He is fondly remembered by locals, one said: “When you think of Pennan, you think of Baden. He did his best to give back wherever he could and he became Pennan’s Local Hero.”Apparently Michael Douglas was so keen to take the lead role as Mac that he met writer director Bill Forsyth in Los Angeles, and followed him to New York “ashe was passing through”, according to Local Hero producer, Iain Smith. Iain said in a previous interview: “Bill is a wonderful, wonderful writer and Michael Douglas is no fool. He could see a winning script from a mile off and was very disappointed he didn’t get the part.” Interestingly, Henry Winkler, who played the Fonz in Happy Days, also threw his hat into the ring, but it was Peter Riegert who won the part. vw, px\"  When you think of Gordon and Stella’s hotel in the film, you may conjure up an image of the Pennan Inn as it stands today. In fact, the local hotel in the fictional village of Ferness, which became Mac and Danny’s temporary home, was just two houses joined together. The Pennan Inn, which did appear in many of the scenes, looks quite dferent and is further down the village. The creative filming doesn’t stop there – the interior shots of the hotel’s bar were not even filmed in Pennan – they were shot in Banff almost  miles away!The Ship Inn, in Banff, doubled as the interior of the MacAskill Arms, but before filming began, the bar was completely renovated – by the production company. The old bar at the Ship Inn was originally a long bar, but was remodeled and converted into a boat shape to resemble the bow of a ship, explained owner Margaretann Johnstone. The Ship Inn is still very popular with tourists wanting to recreate the famous bar scene and quote the line “I’d make a good Gordon, Gordon”. vw, px\"  The red phone box that was Mac’s leline back to Houston in the film was custom-made out of wood for the production so it could be re-positioned nearer the beach, to make the most of the scenic location. The actual red pay phone in Pennan pictured above is in a dferent location sheltered behind a shed down by the village’s waterfront. It is still there today and was granted listed status in  – six years after the film was released. Visitors to the village still flock to the famous red phone box, but interestingly most film fans don’t actually put money in to make a call like Mac did. Instead they call friends and family from their mobile and ask them to call the phone box number.The skies above Aberdeenshire’s coastal areas are even more popular hotspots for stargazing – thanks to Local Hero. Burt Lancaster’s character, Happer, was fascinated by astronomy and tasked Mac with keeping his eyes firmly on the night’s sky and to report any sightings of comets. Alex Wilson, who runs the Aberdeen West Astronomy Group, said: “The Northern Lights featured in the film.” You may recall Mac excitedly describing the magical natural light show to Happer from the phone box  Alex added: “Every year in Aberdeenshire we see the Northern Lights at some point, and because people associate the area with them and the film, it does attract a lot of visitors to the area.” What’s more, the area is ideal for astronomy as there is very little light pollution so you don’t even need a telescope, it can be done easily with the naked eye.It may have been almost  years since the film was made in Pennan but it is still having an impact on tourism. According to Peter Simpson who owns the Pennan Inn, the new musical adaptation is already having a positive effect on visitor numbers. Peter, whose Inn appeared in the film and sits just a stone’s throw away from the famous phone box, revealed: “We have hundreds of visitors every year because of the film, but there has been a recent surge because of the new musical.” Interestingly, during the filming of the  film, the actors and crew actually stayed at the Pennan Inn.*Local Hero at the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh until May .

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"young argyll players make their mark in shinty finals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnthusiastic crowds looked on as the  National First Shinty Championships were held across two Fort William venues.The GS Campbell finals on Saturday February  brought together more than  of the best young players from across Scotland, all vying for the coveted national P and P titles.The P and under tournament was played at the Nevis Centre and the standard of play throughout the day was of the highest order with all  teams giving a great account of themselves.Section A saw Aberdour edge out a classy Strachur Kyles side on goal dference to clinch second spot.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Prentice, a leading thinker in town centre regeneration, will make the remarks in a keynote speech at a Town Centre Conference at Ayr Town Hall tonight. He will point to the revised Business Improvement Districts model, and the new £ million Town Centre Fund announced by the Scottish Government, as major opportunities for further growth in both small and rural towns. He will also highlight the sht towards lestyle service economies in local towns and the critical importance of infrastructure and connectivity. However, Prentice will warn that the towns that refuse to adapt and embrace change, which can involve bold and often uncomfortable choices, including factoring in technological advancement in their future plans, risk being left behind. The event is organised by the Ayr Station Hotel Community Action Group with support from the Kyle and Carrick Civic Society. STP is the national body for Scotland’s towns and all those who work to support the country’s towns and city districts a hub to help people to learn, connect, find practical support and advice, and share good practice and knowledge. The organisation’s deep rooted knowledge of the town’s landscape and extensive range of services supports the Scottish Government’s ongoing commitment to secure a positive future for Scotland’s towns. Speaking ahead of the Ayr Town Centre Conference, Mr Prentice, said:“The recent Scottish budget announcement providing £ million for town centres to drive local economic activity and to stimulate and support place based economic improvements was a welcome respite against the challenging backdrop of ongoing retail closures and public sector shrinkage. “We want our high streets and town centres across Scotland to be vibrant, creative, enterprising and accessible. These centres are at the heart of our communities and the leblood of our country so it is essential that we support them to become more erse and sustainable. “The question is, what the future holds for these towns in the context of the decline in some of the major industries of the past. “A closer look highlights, encouragingly, that the spirit of reinvention is very much alive. However, the towns that will reinvent themselves successfully will be those which are willing to take ambitious, bold, and perhaps uncomfortable, decisions about their future. There is a risk that the towns which hang on to nostalgic notions of past glory, and who refuse to embrace the inevitable change in the economy brought about by advancement in technology, will fall behind. “Like many towns, Ayr is facing change – it’s role as a regional retail and commercial hub has diminished and the opportunity now is to drive some new reinvention. The town has many assets – the coast, river, university, college, council HQ, an airport and the railway. “The emerging plans around culture and heritage, leisure and evening economy, and retail zones look exciting and link many of these assets together. Consensus, compromise and collaboration will be needed, alongside strong leadership and close engagement with local businesses.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsRetail and ConsumerShopping"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"coral scottish grand national festival","story":"NewsCoral Scottish Grand National Festival set to welcome thousands to AyrMore than , race fans will attend the track over the course of the two day festival.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsRace fans are set for a great time at Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe stage is set for Ayr’s busiest weekend of  – the Coral Scottish Grand National Festival, writes Iain Ferguson.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction. Who says personalities donrsquot matter in great historical events "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Don   t let us be banished by Brexit to the back of beyond","story":"Known as The Virgin with the Laughing Child, and about  inches high, it was made around , when Leonardo was a young apprentice in Verrocchiorsquos workshop in Florence. Galleries, and indeed this very exhibition, are stuffed to the rafters with paintings and sculptures of the Madonna and Child. You canrsquot help feeling artists must have grown as weary of this subject as of the Crucixion and the Last Supper. But, since the Church was their main source of income, these iconic images prolerated. Naturally, the finest artists, like Verrocchio, Filippo Lippi and Raphael, took this image and transformed it into a profound portrait of their times, pushing the art form to its limits.Clearly Leonardo also stretched himself from the outset. The baby in the Virgin Maryrsquos lap is chortling, gurgling so realistically you want to laugh with him. His mother, too, looks quietly amused, her mouth reminiscent of the Mona Lisarsquos enigmatic smile. Verrocchiorsquos influence is apparent in this cheery representation, since his sculptures of cherubs and children were often merry. But for Leonardo to portray the Christ child like this was positively revolutionary. This image would have been viewed by some as heretical in the th century, that was not a charge anyone who hoped for a long and productive le wished to have pinned to them.This gem, by one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived, is a reminder of the early days of Florencersquos influence and power. Leonardo was one of a handful of brilliant artists who ignited the Renaissance. Teeming with rich patrons, like the Medici and the Strozzi, and with thousands of churches and chapels needing walls covered and altarpieces filled, the capital of Tuscany was the furnace in which modern art was forged. Without the unparalleled explosion of talent in Leonardorsquos and Michelangelorsquos time, the cityrsquos fortunes would have been very dferent. Who knows what it would look like today.It makes sense, then, that Florence is twinned with Edinburgh, a pairing that dates back to . One created the Renaissance, the other lit the fuse beneath the Enlightenment, which was to rip through Europe, setting it alight. Florence showcased Brunelleschi, Giotto and Ghiberti, while its northern partner nurtured David Hume and Adam Smith. One appealed to the senses, the other to the intellect. Both are founded on banking and finance, their hearts beating in time with the stock market. Each is obsessed with status, class, and appearances. The upper echelons can be chilly and aloof, and in their grand villas and offices it is old money that talks loudest. The nouveau riche will gain entry, but never acceptance. Nor is it coincidence that, floating on so much wealth, both are exquisitely beautul.Many years ago, when Labour was in power at Holyrood, there was talk of enhancing the twin-city link, and to this end a formal partnership that encompassed all of Tuscany and Scotland was proposed. I recall my selfless husband stopping the First Minister in the street and offering to become ambassador to Tuscany, evenit meant being posted to Florence. He said hersquod do it for free, yet strangely, nothing came of it.Wersquore in far more serious times now, of course. With the bond that connects us to Europe soon to be cut, is this not the moment to deepen the relationship with our Tuscan twin  If we could build on our friendship, and on our many mutual interests, we would counter at least some of the damage caused by being set adrt from the EU. Economic blight is bad enough, but to be severed from a region whose culture and people have immeasurably shaped ours is more insidiously harmful. What an oasis of civilisation and culture Florence and the rest of Tuscany would offer to those of us feeling left out in the cold. In turn, we could offer a bridge into Britain, showing that we have not turned our back on our continental European heritage, but are eager to keep it close.Read more: Should we tourists take note of Italys gathering storm To do so would offer tangible results, for both sides. There are many forms it could take, from cultural exchanges, intellectual liaisons and trading or commercial enterprises to environmental partnerships ndash Florence was at the forefront of banning cars in the city centre ndash or historical and artistic projects. The benefits would ripple out. Perhaps as importantly as any pragmatic outcome, however, working more closely with our twin city and twin region would be a statement of intent.

One insider said the PM claimed the talks with Labour were ldquogoing well, which, it was suggested, was not widely believed.As the meeting began there wasa moment of levity as German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed the PM a side-by-side image on her tablet computer of them wearing jackets of the same colour as they took questions in their respective Parliaments earlier inthe day.After Mrs May left following her presentation, the EU leaders discussed Brexit over dinner. It is thought none argued against a Brexit extension, just over how long it should be.Mrs Merkel emphasised the benefits of a longer delay to give Britain time to sort itself out ndash the ldquoflextension option outlined earlier in the week by Mr Tusk.Most EU leaders backed the idea. It is thought  supported a longer delay, but all , as well as the UK, had to agree on the final offer.Francersquos Emmanuel Macron preferred a shorter extension, warning the EU ran the risk of an obstructive UK still being in the bloc and that jeopardising the running of the EU was ldquonot preferable to a no-deal.Sophie Inrsquot Veld, deputy to Guy Verhofstadt, the EU Parliamentrsquos Brexit negotiator, said EU leaders were concerned about extending Brexit amid threats the UK could cause disruption were it to stay in the bloc after its elections.She told BBC Newsnight the EU could ask the UK to pledge not to cause problems but said there was a ldquobig question-mark over how reliable such a vow would beas it would have no legal backing.A further delay to Brexit piles more pressure on the PMrsquos future at home.Three weeks ago Mrs May appeared adamant she would not countenance serving any longer in No Britainrsquos membership of the EU were extended beyond June .She told MPs: ldquoAs Prime Minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June .But ahead of the Brussels summit when pressed on this, she appeared to step back, saying the important issue was securing the flexibility to leave the EU early and avoid having to take part in the May Euro elections.Tory sources stressed the PM stood by her commitment to the backbench  Committee that she would hand over to a successor for the second phase of negotiations after ratication. Last night, the committee met in the Commons but did not discuss the PMrsquos future.In a swipe at the Brexit rebels who blocked her Withdrawal Agreement from passing through Parliament in time to leave on March , Mrs May said: ldquoI know many people are frustrated the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now.I greatly regret Parliament hasnrsquot been able to pass a deal that would have enabled us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.ldquoBut I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward.

Therersquos been serious and constructive talks and they will continue tomorrow.Justice Secretary David Gauke made clear he believed the PM could stay on as Tory leader for another year. ldquoI donrsquot think we should be rushing to change our leader when there is a big task to be done, he said.On Tuesday, the scale of opposition within Tory parliamentary ranks to an extension was laid bare when nearly Tory MPs voted against the PMrsquos decision to ask for a three-month extension to the Article  process.Another  abstained, including four Cabinet ministers Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling and Geoffrey Cox, which meant a majority of Tory MPs defied the leadership.During PMQs yesterday, Conservative MPs questioned the wisdom of any extension.

We have already indicated, as is in fact reflected in the Political Declaration, that we want to retain the benefits of a customs union no tarfs, no quotas and no rules of origin checks, Mrs May added.Yet, of course, whether or not the Labour leader will get into bed, politically, with his Tory counterpart is another question. Everyone talks about what is ldquoin the national interest. But the bottom line is Mr Corbyn believes having a Labour Government is in the national interest while Mrs May believes having a Tory one is in the national interest.Whether the inter-party talks succeed will ultimately come down to a political judgement which probably means they will not.Andthat results in MPs having another round of indicative votes, then this too is fraught with danger. One minister made clear for this to work there would have to be an ldquoabsolute majority of MPs backing one option not one that just has the most votes. And as we have seen no option has thus managed to rally most MPs behind it.And all the while Nicola Sturgeon bides her time on the independence question. A lack of certainty there will probably mean that when the First Minister comes to make her big announcement, after Easter, it will be fudged.As the nation faces another few weeks, months or even years of Brexitry, the decision at the EU summit raised at least one moment of joy.MPs were told Westminsterrsquos Easter recess, already curtailed and facing another week of parliamentary business, was being resurrected.

I told him how strongly many local people felt about this, because of the impact of building a whole new road north and east of the town.“He revealed that Transport Scotland has no intention of looking again at the A options, despite the fact that they have made their case on the basis of completely out-of-date information.“Road users from Inverurie and further west know full well that the AWPR has had a major impact on the A at Inverurie, which only strengthens the case for upgrading that specic stretch of existing road.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Connie Sorrie with the award and the Greengrocer family team\"  National award for family firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Ministers must listen to local people on this issue, and base any decisions on up-to-date traffic data.

Conservative Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg does a dependable line in being quaintly courteous during his frequent interventions on the vexing issue of Brexit, so when he lost his temper last week and threw a tantrum over the prospect of further delays to the UK’s departure from the EU, he revealed a side of him we don’t usually see.It was not a pleasant spectacle.If a Brexit delay meant the UK being – thanks to the need for us to participate in May’s European elections – “stuck” in the EU, then it would be incumbent on our representatives in Strasbourg to be “as dficult as possible”. Rees-Mogg suggested such wheezes as a veto on any increase in EU budgets, the obstruction of any moves towards the creation of an EU army and a block on what he described as French president Emmanuel Macron’s “integrationist schemes”. As is the norm with a frustrated hard-Brexiteer, Rees-Mogg lashes out at others when things don’t go his way. The frightfully polite gentleman schtick evaporates and the teeth are bared beneath that stf upper lip.Pro-Brexit politicians and campaigners would, it seems, never dream of asking themselves whether they might bear any personal responsibility for the situation in which the nation now finds itself.They campaigned in the  referendum on the promisesthat the NHS would prosper and the rest of the world would beat down the UK’s door to lavish us with trade deals.They told us that departure from the EU would be straightforward and painless, predicting negotiations carried through on a warm pillow of bonhomie. And they told us the country would unite behind its new “independent status”.Cynically deflecting every legitimate question as part of a Project Fear strategy, Brexiteers double down on their claims. The problem with anyone who dared to suggest that Brexit mightn’t usher in a new era of British prosperity was that they just didn’t believe.Meaningless stuff, of course. A crisis is a crisis no matter what one believes.Rees-Mogg’s fellow travellers on the Hard Brexit right now say that democracy has been betrayed by the failure of the UK to have left the EU on schedule. The current delay – which looks likely to be extended – and the prospect of the UK having then to participate in May’s European elections has pushed some already furiously angry people closer to the edge. Phasers have been set to maximum outrage.“Forgive them father for they know not what they do,” said Mark Francois, the puffed-up little red-faced Tory MP who’s begun appearing on TV every day in order, it would appear, to display the many and ied ways in which he is a buffoon. We were dangerously close to “Jesus would have voted Leave” territory here. But that’s the hysterical crank-right for you.Rees-Mogg, Francois, the whole whining lot of them, are not the victims of others out to get them. They have not fallen foul of a sinister EU plot or been thwarted by a conspiracy against democracy. The truth is that they and all of the other snake oil salesmen who punted a painless Brexit have been caught out by their own lies. It is as simple as that.During the  campaign, these politicians – and other scoundrels like Boris Johnson – steered away from facts and depended on the emotional response of voters. It was all Take Back Control! and promises of endless sunlit uplands.Nobody who campaigned to Remain is responsible for the fact Leavers relied on unicorn-land fantasies of prosperity to make their case.Brexiteers sneered at the suggestion the EU might not give the UK everything it demanded during departure negotiations. We held so many cards, they said, that our European neighbours would do whatever it took to secure a deal.Now that we know for a fact that the EU has negotiated with the best interests of the EU in mind – fancy that –Brexiteers complain that the UK should have been more forceful.In the fevered fantasies of your Mark Francoises, a Brexiteering hard-man should have walked into those negotiations, slammed his fist on the table and told the whole damned lot of ’em how things were going to be.Rees-Mogg and his cronies in the European Research Group tell us a story of a United Kingdom forced to bend the knee by Europe. In their fantasy, a once-proud Britain is dictated to by the EU. Stripped of influence and power, Britannia has been brought to her knees by unrelated mandarins with their spiteful diktats.Yet, the Rees-Mogg strop suggests to me he knows full well the tale of British subjugation is nonsense. If the UK could go ahead and cause the chaos he wishes to see, doesn’t that rather suggest we have a great deal more influence in the European Union than Brexiteers would like us to think As they get angrier, Brexiteers’ language becomes more dangerous. We’ve heard the accusations of betrayal and treachery, we’ve seen the way some MPs have been singled out for protests by mobs who buy into the lie that the chaos of Brexit represents nothing less than contempt for democracy.This is ugly stuff and I fear things may get much worse.If they do, then those who promised a Brexit that appears – as the nation was frequently warned – to be undeliverable will, I am sure, wring their hands and complain about elites and their contempt for voters. But they cannot continue to outrun their culpability for where we now find ourselves – a bitterly ided Britain that’s become an international laughing stock.Leave campaigners lied and swaggered their way through the  referendum and reality has bitten them, hard. They – and they alone – must take responsibility for the chaos engulfing the Brexit process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"is theresa may the worst prime minister of modern times here are her rivals richard toye","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Without a doubt, British politics is in crisis. Not only does any resolution seem impossible, but the actors have forgotten what they were arguing about in the first place. Nobody, it seems, has any ambition other than to frustrate the actions of their opponents, writes Professor Richard Toye.In this situation, it is natural to blame the person in charge. Theresa May certainly has many faults as prime minister, and must take much of the responsibility for this mess. Few would claim she has shown great political skill during her time in Downing Street, and she is now in office only by default. Even her announcement of her forthcoming departure has turned out to be a damp squib – less a glorious kamikaze move than a slightly squalid act of self harm.But is she, as some would have it, actually the worst prime minister in modern history  It is tempting to see the problems one is living through as peculiarly awful, and to judge the present incumbent of Number  accordingly. But this can lead us to lose perspective.Without doubt, May has some serious competition from previous premiers who have presided over other calamities. Evena no deal Brexit does occur on her watch, nobody has yet claimed that it would be as catastrophic as either of the world wars – though neither of those, of course, was the sole responsibility of the respective prime ministers of the day.Neville ChamberlainIf our focus is on the post- era of universal suffrage, many would be tempted to label Neville Chamberlain as the worst of May’s predecessors. There is no greater insult in British politics than to compare one’s enemy to the “Man of Munich”.Chamberlain will forever be remembered as the man who agreed to let Germany annex part of Czechoslovakia, believing Hitler’s promise that he would make no further claims on European territories. The notorious  deal turned out to be fatally flawed – even though one can make the argument that it was necessary to buy time to prepare for war, it is far from clear that that is what the prime minister thought he was doing.: Brexit debate compared to a ‘Homer Simpson nightmare’Still, Chamberlain’s main shortcomings were not being weak and easily pushed around, as modern legend might have us believe. He was in fact arrogant and controlling. And, surprising as it may seem, he was also much loved by many of his colleagues. It may not be an excuse, but in promoting the appeasement of Germany, he was working with the grain of popular opinion. May, by contrast, has had to struggle with profound isions among the public – though admittedly her own actions have exacerbated these.Anthony EdenThe next contender is surely Anthony Eden. Unlike Chamberlain, Eden had considerable experience of foreign affairs when he picked up the keys to Downing Street, yet it was foreign affairs that brought him down. He may have initially failed to provide “the smack of firm government”, as the Dailyput it, but his tenure was not obviously disastrous until president Nasser of Egypt nationalised the operations of the Suez Canal company in July .Eden regarded this as a political virility test and colluded with the French and the Israelis to launch an invasion which succeeded militarily but which, fatally, alienated Britain’s US allies. Whatever mistakes May has made, she has never engaged in an act of such deliberate and conscious duplicity.Labour contendersLabour leaders must of course be brought into the frame, too. Jim Callaghan was an able politician who successfully resolved the  International Monetary Fund crisis before the Winter of Discontent eventually brought him down. His tenure does not shine, but as even his nemesis Margaret Thatcher gracefully acknowledged, in dferent circumstances he could have been a great prime minister.Gordon Brown, by contrast, lacked many of the personal attributes needed for the job, but at least can claim to have taken successful decisive action in the face of the global financial crisis. In some respects, May’s task has been even more intractable, but although she has shown personal resilience, she has shown little imagination or sureness of touch.: Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon says Theresa May is ‘effectively out of power’David CameronDavid Cameron is seen by many as May’s closest rival for the prime ministerial wooden spoon award. He was a much more polished performer but the glibness of his political judgement was directly responsible for his successor’s predicament.Perhaps the ultimate verdict on May will be that she willingly put herself in charge of a problem that was self-evidently pretty much insoluble. It is still conceivable that she will solve it yet, in the sense of delivering some form of Brexit, however unsatisfactory. If that happens, she will at least meet the standard that she set for herself , evenit brings about catastrophe.Ironically,predictions about the consequences of no deal are correct, her best hope of avoiding the Worst Prime Minister label may be to fail in her own central objective of leaving the EU. Or, perhaps, she can hope to be replaced by someone yet more disastrous. Boris Johnson, step right up.Richard Toye is professor of modern history at the University of Exeter.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed.

Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks.

Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK .

Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust.

Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments.

Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame.

In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach..."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season.

Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-subs.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dancing dentists scoop title","story":"A group of dancing dentists have secured a prestigious prize after their fundraising efforts raised #, for charity.Colleagues from the Bupa Dental Care Banbridge practice came together to waltz, tango, salsa and foxtrot, raising money for their long-standing charity partner, Make-A-Wish, which creates le-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses.In total, the charity event saw  couples hit the dancefloor to compete for success in front of a crowd of more than  people.

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age.

The programme has been developed as part of Northern Ireland#s approach to providing innovative services which have a focus on prevention and has been supported by investment from the transformation fund.Approximately , people are living with diabetes in Northern Ireland, a startling . per cent increase since . Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme. The facilitators offer advice and support to help you make changes to your lestyle and I quickly realised I was eating all the wrong foods and also too much of them. I’m six weeks into the programme and I’ve already lost a stone, I’m feeling better, my concentration levels have heightened and I feel fitter and well. I would urge everyone to go on the programme. It literally has changed my le.”Diabetes UK assistant director for local impact, Dr David Chaney, said: “We only have to look at the startling yearly increase in number of people being diagnosed with type  diabetes to know that we cannot ignore this very serious condition. We know that three in five cases of type  can be prevented or delayed by eating well, being active and achieving a healthy weight, so there is hope for the future. The more we know about diabetes the better we can fight it together, so find outyou are at risk and ask about your local diabetes prevention programme.”The diabetes prevention programme is currently up and running across all five trust areas. People can be referred to the programme by a nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge. It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type .For more information on the diabetes prevention programmeemail your local health trust.The ious emails are: diabetespreventionni@setrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@southerntrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@westerntrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@belfasttrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.net.Nearly , have glaucoma Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"southern trust s gala ball raises 12 000 for pips","story":"The Southern Trust recently held a Gala Ball to raise funds for its charity partners - PIPS Hope and Support and PIPS Upper Bann which are public initiatives for the prevention of suicide and self harm.The Gala raised a total of £, which has been donated to both charities to provide crisis counselling to support vulnerable people who are at risk of suicide and people who self-harm in the Southern Trust area.Trust staff, service users, friends, charity partners and local businesses were treated to an evening of fine dining and outstanding entertainment at the Trust’s ‘Alternative Christmas Party Charity Gala Ball’ in the Armagh City Hotel in February.The evening featured a drinks reception, live music, dancing, an auction and a raffle.

Music and lyrics in the production are by Eurythmics legend Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, who co-wrote and produced Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, so I was looking really forward to hearing how they were going to move the story and action along.The production begins with idealistic couple Sam Wheat, played by Irish actor Niall Sheehy, and Rebekah Lowing in the role of Molly Jensen, a banker and an artist, just starting out on le after buying their first apartment together. Their lives are ripped apart after a mugging goes horribly wrong and Sam is shot dead leaving him ‘between’ here and the afterle. It is his need to protect Molly that drives him to not be welcomed by St Peter at the gates but to try find out what happened.The staging of the production is excellent, whether it’s capturing the New York skyline, taking us into the bowels of the city’s subway or to ‘psychic’ Oda Mae Brown’s palmistry studio just off the beaten track where Sam meets his ally – and a way to get answers.With such a tragic story, comic relief thankfully comes in spades with the introduction of Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae, a character brought so brilliantly to le when Whoopi Goldberg did the job onscreen. Jacqui and Niall work brilliantly together and her outlandish outfits are a sight to behold as she belts out ‘Are You a Believer’ to the sad souls coming through her door hoping for a connection to a loved one who has passed on. The use of theatrical trickery is extremely clever, especially when conveying the moment Sam is murdered and immediately becomes a ‘ghost’ or when trying to access a door or move pieces of furniture.A special mention must go to Sergio Pasquariello in his role as the couple’s shady friend Carl, who it becomes clear is in way over his head at the bank, and Jules Brown in his role as murderer Willie Lopez. Both bring menace to the stage and the message is that all is not what it seems no matter how much you think you know a person. Lovonne Zeus Richards is excellent in his role as the Subway Ghost who helps Sam realise how to use his death to his advantage in his quest for retribution.The finale is beautully staged as Sam and Molly get to – and have to – say their final goodbyes and we hear a stirring rendition from Niall Sheehy of The Righteous Brothers’ Unchained Melody – and it’s fair to say there was a bit of snuffling and snfling among the audience.Initially thought unstageable, Ghost The Musical really does work and with tickets limited throughout its week run it’s best to get them quick.Ghost The Musical runs at the Grand Opera House until Saturday April .

At the end of the current season, Sport and Leisure Swts will cease to exist and the club will change their name to Belfast Celtic. Sport and Leisure are locked in a relegation battle in the Bluefin Premier Intermediate League – the third tier of the Irish League. Relegation could see them move into the Ballymena and Provincial League, where fellow West Belfast sides St James’ Swts and Donegal Celtic currently play. However, in a surprise move, Belfast Media Group understands that the club is actively pursuing their options for next season which could see them apply for affiliation to the SSE Airtricity League . Sport and Leisure Swts are affiliated to the Irish Football Association and it was believed the new Belfast Celtic entity would simply take their place. Yet, the committee at Glen Road Heights are exploring their options with Belfast Celtic apparently free to join a dferent league.Clubs seeking to switch leagues would usually require permission from both bodies and it would be unlikely that the IFA would grant such a move. However, a club source expressed their view that the club could force a switch under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In any case, they may not need legal assistance as, strictly speaking, a new club under the name of Belfast Celtic will be formed next month when Sport and Leisure Swts ceases to exist. It is understood that the committee have already held preliminary talks with League of Ireland officials who would welcome a new member as long as the switch received the backing of the IFA. SSE Airtricity Premier Division side Derry City started off in the Irish League, winning the title in . Issues surrounding security during The Troubles forced them to play their home games in Coleraine before they dropped out of the Irish League. Following a number of years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland in . Belfast Celtic would be an interesting addition to the League of Ireland should they go down that route. Following a long and protracted saga, Sport and Leisure had their application to change their name to Belfast Celtic approved by the board of the IFA last December having consulted with the Northern Ireland Football League, the Co Antrim FA and the Belfast Celtic Society.Sport and Leisure have endured a dficult campaign have find themselves at the foot of the table with just five games remaining. They have three games in hand over second from bottom Armagh City and the sides clash at Holm Park on Saturday afternoon. Packie McAllister’s men also face two games with Portstewart in the coming weeks.Sport and Leisure’s struggles this season have been exacerbated following a host of suspensions handed out to key players in the wake of their abandoned tie with Portstewart in January. Padraig Lynch and Stephen McAlorum are among those set toto action for Saturday’s crucial trip to Armagh, but goalkeeper Michael Magill remains suspended. McAllister’s men gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation after they battled back from three goals down to claim a vital point against Dollingtown last Saturday at Glen Road Heights.An own goal from Gavin Johnston and a double from Dollingstown’s Keith Johnston seemed to gave sealed the points for the visitors and the Swts suffered a further blow when midfielder Pierce Tully was dismissed. However, they mounted a rousing comeback in the final half hour and goals from Liam Carland, Ronan Carroll and substitute Ciaran McKissock levelled the game at -. Dollingstown were also reduced to  men when Richard Thompson was shown a red card in the closing stages.With Armagh suffering a - defeat to Moyola last Saturday, this weekend’s showdown with Sport and Leisure in Holm Park will go a long to deciding which side finishes bottom of the Premier Intermediate League. It just might not decide which league the West Belfast outfit will be playing in next season when they become Belfast Celtic."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sarsfields ace mckenna braced for toughest test against rossa","story":"NIALL McKenna says he is relishing the prospect of putting his shoulder to the wheel for Sarsfield’s again this season after spending last year in England.The dual star helped Warwickshire hurlers to last season’s Nicky Rackard Cup decider at Croke Park where they were defeated by Donegal in the final.McKenna was often a spectator at games last season and admitted he found it tough watching on as the Paddies struggled to match their exploits from their stunning  campaign when they annexed the Junior Football Championship and the Intermediate Hurling Championship.“I missed it. I was good being over there and playing for Warwickshire,” said McKenna.“At the same time, I wanted to be back home. It was hard watching Sarsfield’s playing when I came back knowing I couldn’t play Championship. It was hard to take. Our aim has to be to try and have a year like we had two years ago.“I think we should have a good shout. The Intermediategrade looks tough this year, but with the squad we have we should be capable of going well again.”On the football front, Sarsfield’s face neighbours Rossa at the Bear Pit tonightwith both teams bidding to build on their opening victories.Sarsfield’s defeated St Pat’s Lisburn by four points in round one in a repeat of the  JFC final while Rossa laid down a serious marker by defeating Aldergrove - to - in their Division Two opener, so McKenna is expecting a tough battle this evening.“This will be the hardest game we have in the ision,” said McKenna.“We have to play as well as we can and just worry about ourselves and don’t think too much about Rossa.“No matter who we play, we would fancy our chances at home so we have to play to the best of our ability and see where it takes us.“We had a good win over St Pat’s in our first game so we have to try and build that from.”Rossa manager Sean Fleming, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction with their emphatic win over Aldergrove, but stressed that they will have plenty of competition for promotion this season.“ We were very pleased with it because when both teams were in Division One it was always a one-point game between us. It was good to start the season off with a win against a decent team,” said Fleming.“We hoped to make a quick escape from Division Two the last time we were in it and it didn’t happen for seven or eight years.“Just because you’ve dropped down from Division One doesn’t give you a right to think you’ll go straight back up. You’ve a lot of good quality teams in the ision and they want the same thing we do.”Fleming, like McKenna, is anticipating a close contest when Rossa and Sarsfield’s clash this evening.“It wouldn’t matterone of the teams were in Division One and the other were in Division Three, it is going to be a very close game,” added the Rossa boss, who is sweating on the fitness of Michael Armstrong, Richard Gowdy and Thomas Morgan.“This group of lads from both teams have grown up with each other. They would have faced each other at U, U and at minor and they were always very close games.“Sarsfield’s always play a good brand of strong, physical, competitive football.

The teaching group travelled to St Colm’s in Twinbrook in the hope of gaining some insight from the school’s renowned English department.The head of the Dutch group, Lisette Bentvelzen, enthused about the opportunities and knowledge they had already gained from the trip. Talking to the Andersonstown News, she said: “We are here on a study trip to educate ourselves but we have been given the chance to come to and see how a school like this works. It has been very interesting.”“We have seen some subjects here we would love to introduce into our school. Home Economics and Photography, we don’t have. These really specialised subjects would be lovely for us to have. It was also very interesting to hear about the school, the area it’s in and the high performance they achieve.”Stressing the educational value of the trip, Ms Bentvelzen lauded the staff, students and facilities. “The children are really lovely. We’ve been in several classes but we have not been teaching, because we are from a completely dferent school.“We’ve just been observing in class, listening in, and the teacher explains to us what they#re doing. I talked to one of the students in a Home Economics class while she was cooking and she was enjoying herself and she mentioned something interesting. She told me, ‘Ive been away for a while and I’ve realised I can’t miss classes too much because you miss so much.’ It’s lovely to hear that from students.”“Being in this school is very dferent for a lot of us. We have already been to a number of other schools, we’ve got some young colleagues with us and they haven’t seen this before, so it’s an eye opener, how dferent the education system is over here.”Principal Adrian Walsh echoed these sentiments, stating that the staff and pupils were “delighted” to showcase their facilities and school ethos to their visitors.“They came to us through InterEducation, who askedwe were willing to host a party of teachers from Holland as they were trying to improve English as a foreign language in their own setting.“We felt it was a fantastic opportunity for them to come and see what we do. We have fantastic belief in our young people, we have an excellent English department and we would like to showcase St Colm’s as an outstanding school particularly in our provisions of English. “We are delighted that they#re here and they’ve had an informative, enjoyable morning. It#s been a lovely event.”On the possibility of furthering this relationship, Mr Walsh remained hopeful, telling the Andersonstown News: “Maybe there’s a partnership possibility with the school. It would be good to have contacts in another country, just so that we can share our experiences and our practices with dferent cultures and so on. “There will be plenty that we can learn from them and maybe something they can learn from us.#"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But we want to avoid an extension that just allows for more indecision and more uncertainty. So Id prefer to see a longer extension during which the United Kingdom has more time to decide really what future relationship it wants to have with the European Union, rather than the alternative, which could be rolling extensions every couple of weeks, every couple of months.\"He said the UK and Ireland would find themselves in a \"dilemma\" in the event of a no-deal because they would have to balance obligations under trade rules to check goods and obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to keep the Irish border open.\"It would be up to us to protect the single market and it would be up to the United Kingdom to enforce WTO rules,\" he said. \"We would both find ourselves in a dilemma because, on one hand we would have obligations under the European treaties, theyd have obligations under the World Trade Organisation.\"But then theres the Good Friday Agreement and, to me, that is equally important and the Good Friday Agreement is about the peace process, its about ensuring we have free movement of people, goods and animals.\"Mr Varadkar said Ireland was exploring the possibility of conducting regulatory checks away from the border, potentially on business premises.He noted that the UK Governments no-deal plan suggested initially treating Northern Ireland dferently from Great Britain in terms of tarfs and checks.\"That opens up the potential to have the checks at the ports in Larne and Belfast, which is the logical place to have them of course, not on the land border,\" he said.The Taoiseach said he would like the principles behind the Withdrawal Agreements contentious border backstop to be honoured eventhere was a no-deal.\"The reason we came up with the backstop is because it is the solution and, even in the event of a no-deal we will be saying to the UK You still have obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, you still committed to full regulatory alignment back in December  and we still want the arrangements that are in the backstop to apply,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"everyone is just sick and tired says man behind the vote for muppets posters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fact that she was able to move from job to job despite the fact consecutive employers identied alarming failings has raised concerns.Aidan Hanna from NI Patient Voice said: \"The Regulation Quality and Improvement Authorityshould be looking at disciplinary cases at each care home inspection so it is worrying that a nurse can leave or be dismissed from four care homes in such a short period of time without the RQIA identying a trend.\"It is also worrying that a nurse can get a job at a nursing home without the previous employer being spoken to.\"It is very worrying that a nurse can get a job at a hospital without the previous employer being spoken to or without the knowledge that the nurse had been dismissed from four care homes.\"Why did none of the four care homes refer the nurse to the NMCthey were concerned about capability or competency \"The NMC  heard from a number of Ms Bordas former colleagues.One witness said: \"For somebody who was qualied and who had worked as a nurse previously, I felt I had to explain things to the registrant over and over again which shouldnt have needed repeating.\"For instance, I told the registrant that she needed to improve her standards of personal care, because she was doing things such as cleaning during personal hygiene from bottom up, rather than top-down as she should have done.\"Another witness described her knowledge of medication as \"notably poor\", while the  was also told that she did not seek clarication on the dosage of a medication when a prescription was illegible.The regulatory body was also told that Ms Bordas forgot to wash her hands before and after cleaning wounds and that the wounds did not look any cleaner after she had finished.Taking into consideration the evidence before them, the  found that Ms Bordas supplied  references in a \"premeditated and pre-planned act of dishonesty\".They said it was done \"with the sole purpose of deceiving her employer into believing she was a competent nurse\".The  continued: \"Her actions were solely for her own personal gain, with a total disregard for the safety of patients. The  found that this amounted to serious misconduct.\"In its determination, the  deemed that the public would be horriedMs Bordas were to be allowed to continue working unrestricted.It ruled that a striking-off order was the only sanction that would be sufficient in light of Ms Bordas \"deplorable\" dishonesty."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic translinks plans for open championship","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

TaxPayers Alliance has criticised the high remuneration.Its chief executive John OConnell said: \"The average council tax bill has gone up by more than £ over the last  years and spending has gone through the roof.\"Disappointingly, many local authorities are now responding to financial reality through further tax rises and reducing services, rather than scaling back top pay.\"Despite many in the public sector facing a much-needed pay freeze to help bring the public finances under control, many town hall bosses are continuing to pocket huge remuneration packages, with staggering payouts for those leaving their jobs.\"There are talented people in the public sector who are trying to deliver more for less, but the sheer scale of these packages raises serious questions about efficiency and priorities.\"The next highest-earning council chiefs were Liam Hannaway and Roger Wilson, chief executives of Newry, Mourne and Down, and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon respectively.Mr

services is the very least the public deserves.\"As a recent independent review of chief officers pay in Northern Ireland showed, after market testing, our pay rates for this group are in keeping with

Another  apartments at the other side of the complex are not affected and the shopping centre remains open for business as usual.The Health and Safety Executive has been informed, as has Belfast City Councils building control department. The shopping centre said it was working with the managing agents to assist in their investigation.In February evidence of the problem first emerged in two apartments. At that point  homes were evacuated and investigations begun on the rest of the structure to determine the extent of the issue. On Wednesday engineers recommended all the apartments be evacuated and residents informed within hours of that decision.Some residents however, have decided not to leave their homes.In a statement the management company said: \"The estimated cost of the repairs is signicant given the technical nature of the work involved. It is estimated that the repair work will take approximately  weeks and the management company is working towards having works commence on site as soon as possible. \"The repair work will involve a period of investigation to determine the specic cause of the damage and the parties responsible.\"It is understood the repairs will run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Apartment owners are shareholders in the management company and therefore liable for the costs. The BBC reported they have each been asked for a £, contribution to the costs. However, depending on what the cause of the problem is, the owners could recover their costs at a later stage from the person or organisation responsible.The management company continued: \"It is regrettable that this situation will cause inconvenience to the residents of the apartments and the management company is doing all it can to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. However, the absolute priority is to protect the structure of the building and ensure the safety of its residents.\"In order for evacuated residents toto the building as soon as possible, it will necessary for the management company to apply its funds in the first instance towards the required repairs. The management company is therefore not in a position to make any assurances in relation to costs incurred by the evacuated residents for alternative accommodation. \"It is possible that some residents may be able toto their apartments sooner the projected date for completion of the repair works but this cannot be confirmed at this point in time. In the meantime, the management company and its agent will continue to liaise directly with apartment owners affected by the required evacuation.\"The first residents moved into the apartments in  on completion of the £million residential, retail and leisure development."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37995979.ece/43e3c/BINARY/air_bnb_horror_001.jpg","title":"irish familys horror at finding eight hidden cameras in greek airbnb","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The next morning Aaron noticed something in the corner of the room.“He’d be pretty high-tech so he called me and said ‘have a look at that’. It was a camera.“Then we started looking all over the house. There were cameras everywhere, even in the toilet. It was a big bathroom with a hot tub and a sauna.“There was a motion sensor camera in the corner watching everything, in the corners of the bedroom as well.“There wasn’t one room in that house that didn’t have a camera.“We called a meeting at the pool area and discussed what we were going to do because we didn’t know what we were dealing with.“We knew we needed to get out of this house. He would have been watching us and saw us taking photos of his cameras.“We just left as quickly as we could.”A spokesman for Airbnb said that it took immediate action against the homeowner and suspended his account.“We take privacy issues extremely seriously. As soon as we were made aware we removed this host from our  and fully refunded the guests,” a spokesman said.“We have strict standards governing surveillance devices in listings and take reports of any violations very seriously.“There have been more than half a billion guest arrivals on Airbnb to date and issues are incredibly rare.” data-dfpadtargetingThe Conroys holiday apartment.The family had spent just one night in the villa before they found the cameras, and had to organise accommodation for the remaining five nights.However, although Airbnb refunded them the money for the villa, the family said there was no compensation over the incident and they struggled to find accommodation that was of similar standard to the villa.“We went down to my sister’s place and rang Airbnb. The customer service really was appalling, really terrible,” Ms Conroy said.“I rang the police in Greece.

There have been over half a billion guest arrivals in Airbnb listings to date and negative incidents are incredibly rare.” Airbnb has strict policies governing the use of cameras in listings – they are never allowed in bathrooms or bedrooms or to be hidden – and has a zero tolerance stance when it comes to violations.There have been several high profile cases of holidaymakers finding hidden cameras in Airbnb properties in recent years.Dougie Hamilton was on holiday with his girlfriend in Toronto, Canada, in  when he found one hidden in a digital clock.The Scottish holidaymaker told the Daily Record: “We were only in the place for  minutes when I noticed the clock. There was just something in my head that made me feel a bit uneasy.“I took the charger out of it and saw there was a lithium battery in the back. At this point, I slid the front facing off the clock and could see there actually was a camera. The hidden camera was facing into the living area and open-plan bedroom, so it could see everything. We didn’t knowthe owner had been watching. It just felt really creepy and we didn’t want to stay.”"},{"url":null,"title":"judge tells narcissist julian assange to get over to us","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No extradition” and “True journalists support Julian Assange”.Speaking to a waiting pack of reporters, photographers and camera operators, WikiLeaks’ editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: “Anyone who wants the press to be free should consider the implications of this case.“If they will extradite a journalist to the US then no journalist will be safe.

We are a small school and have been in danger of this for many years.“With everything going on politically at the moment, and money drying up everywhere and Brexit, I’m not surprised they would come after a small school now.“I am absolutely devastated though and won’t know how to tell my childrenthis goes forward. They call it ‘The Little School with a Big Heart’ for a reason.”Some parents have decided to await the outcome before telling their children, but Mrs McLaughlin gave assurances that they won’t allow the school to close without a fight.“I think a lot are waiting to see what happens. I’m fairly certain the parents here will give a good fight...we feel very passionately about it,” she explained.“The relationships the children have with each other and the teachers are so important. Not to mention the solid academics with such a small ratio. My son has gone strength to strength.“I don’t know anywhere  we could have such a lovely educations for our children.”The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell.  Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and .The school has been a part of the local community for over  years.  It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs part of a pre-publication consultation, the Education Authority is currently seeking any objections or comments on the proposed discontinuance of Groarty CIPS from the Board of Governors, parents and staff of Groarty CIPS and Trustees, and other interested parties in the local community.The consultation document makes reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S.It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daróige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places.The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school.Joint campusThe EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education.  And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daróige.Both schools made a joint submission under the Shared Education CampusesProgramme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.”At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.In justication of its proposed closure of Groarty CIPS, the EA said it believes other schools in the area can cater for the children’s educational needs and home-to-school transport will “mitigate against this impact” and provide for the safe transportation of pupils from the area to their nearest school.Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still not up and running, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The closing date for the consultation process is June  and for those who want to have their say, you can visit: www.eani.org.uk prepublication-consultations groarty-ips"},{"url":null,"title":"richard bolitho derry born dam buster commemorated city cemetery","story":"CAPTION: Derry born Richard Bolitho is pictured on the far right.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

Both race courses were demanding and involved some climbing over Slievenaslat.First home in the km race was former St Malachyrsquos old boy Castlewellanrsquos Connaire McVeigh and fellow student, Bryansfordrsquos Sean Russell followed closely in suit.Dromara teacher Jonny Crutchley used the local race for his attack on the London Marathon, hopefully he will remember his club vest for that.The Newcastle hotelier was next showing the younger McVeigh how to climb. It was notable to see Jack OrsquoHare, fresh from his winter hibernation and Brexit debates, back racing again.Next home was Kilcoo man John Kelly, who relished having a recce over the course with the young lads. Other finishers were Dominic McGreevy, who took a detour looking for another climb.St Johnrsquos man Micky Flynn enjoyed the local trails, Rita Devlin, Lorna Cunningham, Nicola Mathers and Mr lsquoCastlewellan Parkrunrsquo McCann took time out from their marathon preparations.Mr and Mrs McCrickard completed along with Castlewellanrsquos Charlie McAlinden, who missed the local GAA derby in the Meadow, loved reminiscing from his school days.The locals did notice a notable absentee in Burrenbridge man James King whose excuse was he didnrsquot have enough eggs for lunch and was busy calving.Young Tom Crudington took part in the k race where he finished sixth.

With just a tenth of a second separating him from top spot, he carried plenty of momentum into qualying the following day with the JTR team.After dealing with a treacherous first few laps, it became clear it was the right decision and Harper took full advantage.

People have moved on and these types of actions are not acceptable and have no support in our community.ldquoThose responsible need to accept that they progress no-onersquos agenda but their own and the wider community will condemn this activity and call for it to cease.Local Sinn Fein councillor John Rice also condemned those responsible for the device.The Slieve Croob representative said: ldquoAs we approach the local government election, the only acceptable way to get your message across to the community is at the ballot box, not like this. This also seriously inconvenienced members of the public with the road closure, particularly schoolchildren trying to get to school.Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis has said he commended ldquothe diligence of the local resident who spotted the device and alerted emergency service.He said that it looked like the device was ldquopositioned to ambush and kill, adding: ldquoPolice should now begin to carry out local searches to establish where and how this device was constructed.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues.

Two members of the party managed to make their way to Tollymore Mountain Centre to report that a  year-old girl had collapsed with exposure. She was brought down to a rescue vehicle by the others in her group and they were all taken to safety in a minibus.The Ardnabannon team handled the third rescue operation when children got into trouble at Lukersquos Mountain.

Both firms have extensive involvements in the agricultural industry.Public reaction to the sale is cheerful as Montalto will continue to be run as an agricultural enterprise and will not be stripped of any of its assets.The future of the mansion will be carefully considered by the new owners. They have bought the whole estate so that they can control everything that happens and they are anxious that nothing is ruined or destroyed. The estate workers have been offered continuity of employment.Both firms clearly recognise the esteem in which the Clanwilliam family and the property are held and they aim to preserve the traditions and attaching goodwill.Lord Clanwilliam will be remaining in residence for some months until he acquires a home in England.

But Ms Godfrey made it clear that this is not a viable option on a long term basis.Her letter adds: ldquoThe current marshalling area cannot operate as a self-policing facility due to restrictions of the road infrastructure within Strangford village.ldquoWe are currently exploring alternative arrangements to facilitate queueing vehicles and have agreed to work with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to bring forward options on this matter for consultation after the local elections.At the start of the year, politicians on both sides of Strangford Lough joined forces to help improve the busy waterwaysrsquos ferry crossing and address local concern.As part of a new initiative, they met with the arearsquos most senior roads official who is responsible for the service with two key issues dominating the agenda mdash an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry and the congestion in Strangford village caused by ferry traffic.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the commitment to investigate both areas of concern, explaining that the congestion in Strangford is particularly acute at times which impacts on residents and businesses.He said locals are keen to see drivers wishing to board the ferry using a dedicated lane which runs alongside the ferry terminal, with additional finance provided to enable staff to ensure the lane is used to combat the congestion problem.Cllr Curran continued: ldquoThere is a need for an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to meet the needs of people heading for work. The first sailing is always busy and many are left frustratedthey are not able to make it.It was reported recently that some workers are forced to leave their car in Strangford all week and travel as foot passengers on the first morning crossing from Portaferry to make sure they get across the waterway and on to their place of work.ldquoThere is a clear need for the earlier sailing and I fully recognise the need to ensure this does not create an unnecessary convenience residents when the ferryrsquos engines are started.

In , electricity workers at Ballylumford power station cut electricity supplies as part of the Ulster Workers’ Council strike and it was the threat to turn off electricity entirely which saw Stormont’s power-sharing Sunningdale Agreement administration collapse.In , SONI was sold to Eirgrid, the Irish state-owned company which runs the grid south of the border, while Arlene Foster was Stormont’s energy minister. The following year, also during Mrs Foster’s tenure, another Irish government-owned company, ESB, bought Northern Ireland’s entire electricity network of pylons and cables. It also owns one of the main power stations, Coolkeeragh.SONI is now facing a strike by members of the Prospect trade union, mainly over pay. However, some staff have also raised concerns about SONI’s independence from Eirgrid.The News Letter asked SONI whether it was possible for Eirgrid control room staff in Dublin to dispatch electricity generation north of the border and whether Eirgrid staff would be brought in to help run the system during the industrial action.SONI said in a statement that its operational licence “contains conditions to ensure our independence” and insisted it was “compliant with this requirement”.It said that the wholesale electricity market has been operated on an all-island basis since the Single Electricity Market was launched in  and “the dispatch and scheduling of generation is done on an economic basis for the benefit of customers in both jurisdictions, undertaken on a shared basis via the two control centres in Belfast and Dublin”.SONI said that the trade union was “committed to maintaining security of supply in the actions planned” and “on this basis, SONI has made arrangements to ensure that the industrial action would have no impact on the integrity of the Northern Ireland electricity system”.It urged the union to call off the strike and enter into talks.Grant Thornton probed over Interserve audits Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Professor Jon Tonge, who has researched the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement, said that although Harold Wilson and Merlyn Rees had never really believed the agreement would work, they had been willing to give it a chance but “once the lights were literally going to go out was when they called time on it”. “Electricity was everything in ,” he said. “The electricity workers were literally pulling the plug on a country – that was the crucial moment when they paralysed Northern Ireland.”The University of Liverpool academic said that control of electricity had been a “toxic” issue at that point and the fact that things have changed so radically “speaks volumes” about wider political changes.“Dublin is in one aspect literally controlling the north. That speaks volumes for the change in all-island relationships. In , even broader economic cross-border activity was sometimes seen as threatening.“But we have seen a thawing, not just politically but societally – the two business classes barely recognise the border. There has been a withering of the border which is reflected here in an all-island electricity system where in effect power is conceded to the south – quite literally.”The Northern Ireland Utility Regulator said that its immediate priority was to ensure that services are maintained and consumers protected.

People are “bombarded with encouragement to gamble online” he said, and called on the government to intervene.As well as its shops, William Hill also runs an online gambling operation.In the Commons chamber itself, whilst in  Mr Paisley voted to tighten the law on planning permission for betting shops, he was absent from votes in  and  on fixed-odds betting machines according to the website TheyWorkForYou, which tracks MPs’ voting records.His father Rev Paisley had taken a strident line on the issue of betting – in  he told the Commons: “The gambling craze is no new sprite but an old transgression that’s come down the centuries, bringing with it a thousand woes.”The News Letter contacted Mr Paisley yesterday. He was asked about why, given his past calls to tighten regulation of the gambling industry, he accepted the gt.“I’ve really no comment to make”, he said.He was also asked about his father’s views on the subject, to which he said: “I’ve really no comment to make.”Asked lastlyhe would even say which match he attended, he replied: “I’ve really no comment to make.”Cltonville Football Club issue statement on future of striker Jay Donnelly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Commons register shows the gt from William Hill was received on March , , and registered five days later.Assuming the tickets were used on March , he could have been at one of three matches: Liverpool v Burnley, Cha v Wolves, or Arsenal v Man Utd.In addition, looking through Mr Paisley’s register for  shows that in May that year, the same month he made his statement calling for a clampdown on gambling, he used £,-worth of travel and hospitality provided by the Northern Ireland Friends of Israel.The address of Northern Ireland Friends of Israel listed in the Commons’ register is “c o Oasis Retail Services Ltd, Mallusk Drive, Newtownabbey”.Founded by NI-born man Gerald Steinberg in , Oasis describes itself as the “premier supplier of gaming and betting machines to licensed betting offices in Northern Ireland”.These include things such as poker machines. Mark Baillie, Northern Ireland policy officer for the charity Christian Action Research and Education , which has been critical of the gambling industry, did not address Mr Paisley’s specic case but said in general: “We hope elected representatives think very carefully about taking money from the gambling industry.“Obviously we don’t want the industry, with all its financial muscle, to be exerting undue influence on our politicians.“Problem gambling is a very serious issue here in Northern Ireland and we have four times as many problem gamblers than in England.”try catch  TrendingStricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant end like thisThese are the  bizarre items you can take on a plane from Belfast International AirportMan dies after three vehicle collision on NI roadlsquoIrsquoll stab you in your pregnant bellyrsquo, child tells NI teacherBomb scare in N.I. housing estate -

The so called ‘flexible’ extension to October  was a compromise solution thrashed out by EU leaders after French President Emmanuel Macron dug in against a longer delay lasting into .The deal has drawn sharp criticism from Tory Eurosceptics and prompted questions about how long Mrs May can stay in power.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson – whose party keeps the minority Tory administration in power – said Mrs May’s credibility as PM is now in question. And in a scathing assessment, DUP deputy leader Mr Dodds said the extension to Halloween was “another embarrassment for the UK”, adding that the move has led to “much concern and anger” at Westminster. The North Belfast MP told the News Letter: “It was inevitable, after she decided that any deal is preferable to no deal, that Mrs May would have to accept whatever extension the EU gave her.”He added: “It is a humiliating position for the British government to be in, but it is a position which it has created for itself through its inept handling of the negotiations. “It is bizarre that three years after the referendum result we are going to end up in a situation where we are still in the EU and fighting European elections. It is entirely the result of the way the negotiations have been carried out.”Under the terms of the extension,Mrs May finally gets her Withdrawal Agreement approved by the House of Commons the UK could leave the EU earlier than the October  deadline.When askedhe thought the latest Brexit delay would increase the likelihood that Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement – complete with the controversial Irish border backstop arrangement – would be voted through Parliament, Mr Dodds replied: “I don’t think the delay makes it any more or any less likely that the Withdrawal Agreement will go through. “I don’t think it settles anything, it simply prolongs the current limbo and uncertainty, which is the one thing people are keen to see ended, as it is bad for everyone.”Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP would not back her Brexit deal unless the party’s concerns over the backstop are addressed.“The fundamental problem is still the backstop. If it were addressed things could move on to the next stage of the talks,” he added.

It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees.

Close to half the list recorded double-digit percentage turnover growth.These are positive trends given modest economic growth levels and uncertainties caused by Brexit, global trade ‘wars’ and the lack of an Executive here in Northern Ireland.This group of  firms is a dynamic cohort when looking at the broader economy.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
