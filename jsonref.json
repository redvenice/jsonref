Campaigners claim that the US practice of giving chicken a chlorinated wash to remove harmful bacteria can compensate for poor hygiene and welfare standards on farms, allowing American producers to undercut their rivals.Minette Batters, from farming union NFU, warned this week that ‘opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt, it would be the work of the insane’.Environment minister Zac Goldsmith said Mrs Batters was right about the principles but wrong about the Government’s policy.‘To impose high standards on our farmers, only to undercut them with low standard imports would be wrong on every level, and there is no argument about that,’ Lord Goldsmith said.But Government sources last night cautioned that ministers were not proposing a blanket ban on cheap American food.One pointed out that, while the Tory manifesto talked about ‘safeguarding high standards of animal welfare’ in any deal, it was silent on issues such as genetically-modified crops, which are produced on an industrial scale in the US.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is said to have underlined the importance of removing barriers to its farm produce during talks with Miss Truss earlier this week. A formal response to the UK’s proposals is not expected for a fortnight.

But they remain far apart on key issues, including legal oversight, fishing and the EU’s demand that Britain should continue to follow its rules after the transition period expires at the end of this year.And the agenda revealed they cannot even agree on terminology – with the EU demanding talks on a ‘level playing field’, while the UK refers to ‘open and fair competition’. But it was agreed that the talks will be conducted in English, with Brussels agreeing to pay translation costs if Mr Barnier wishes to speak in French.Talks will alternate between Brussels and London, with five rounds pencilled in ahead of a ‘high-level summit’ in June when Mr Johnson will decide if it is worth continuing with them.But France’s Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin warned yesterday: ‘We cannot let our level of ambition be affected by what I would call artificial deadlines.

The fact that, in a civilised democracy, part of the European Union, serious news outlets can be used as a platform for the kind of fake news that doesn’t even withstand the most rudimentary scrutiny is profoundly shocking.’From the beginning of what she describes as the campaign against her, Corinna and her staff – including several British citizens – have found their phones and computers tampered with.There have been constant cyber attacks on her house in Belgravia, including the remote disabling of the panic button in her bedroom.Today Corinna says she’s routinely followed in London, and that her home was at one point put under special police protection.Then, in 2017, came the mysterious break-in at her Regency mansion, Chyknell Hall.Adam Crookshank, a former officer in the British Army and Corinna’s chief of staff, said: ‘It is astonishing that somebody would be able to cut a perfect hole in Corinna’s bedroom window.‘It shows a high level of competence, not only to execute it, but to know which bedroom was hers.’On March 5 last year, Corinna’s legal team wrote to the head of the Spanish royal household informing them of the alleged abuse, requesting a meeting and talking for the first time about legal action.There was no response, but several days later the king called her from his satellite phone and made an urgent request for an appointment to see her in London.On Saturday, March 16, he flew to London on a private jet and met Corinna and her son, Alexander. The British authorities were not informed.Alexander, 17, confirmed that the meeting had taken place and said: ‘I cannot discuss the details of this private meeting except to say the King Emeritus was very preoccupied with the subject of media interest.’What could motivate agents of the Spanish state to behave in such a way? Corinna believes it is the result of political infighting within Spain, combined with a suspicion that she knows more than she actually does from her time with Juan Carlos – plus a wish to keep her firmly under control.‘I believe they want me out of the way,’ she said. ‘It is quite obvious that they fell I am a threat.’         Princess Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein is pictured with Prince Charles and Bob Colacello. According to her lawyer, Robin Rathmell, legal counsel at Kobre \u0026amp Kim, the case is of the utmost importanceFar-fetched as her account might seem, it is a story that some extremely serious people are prepared to believe.James Watt, a former British ambassador to Lebanon and Egypt, is one of her advisers on the case.He said: ‘An extraordinary campaign of character assassination and psychological pressure was mounted and has been driven with obsessive persistence for eight years.‘It must have involved a major commitment of resources by the Spanish secret services.’In a sworn affidavit, which will form part of the High Court evidence, Jose Villarejo, a former commissioner with the national Spanish police, said: ‘I can only say there are about 120 agents in charge of actions referring to the so-called incidents with the monarchy. Corinna was fully controlled, fully monitored by a team of the CNI.’Corinna’s legal team has written to MI5 and MI6. The Foreign Office and Buckingham Palace have also been informed.So far, she says, the Spanish royal household has refused to engage with her or her legal team.The team have met the Spanish ambassador in London to outline the allegations, she says, but they came away with no denial and feel they were dismissed.According to her lawyer, Robin Rathmell, legal counsel at Kobre \u0026amp Kim, the case is of the utmost importance. ‘The fact that people from a foreign intelligence service flew to London unannounced in order to threaten a private citizen in her hotel room is astonishing and demands a serious investigation,’ he said.‘All reasonable attempts to resolve the situation out of court have failed.‘Our client has no choice but to pursue a formal legal path.

He discusses his new book of unseen small camera worksIn the early 1970s, Stephen Shore made a series of large-format photographs of main streets in the US. He showed them to his friend and fellow photographer, Hilla Becher, one half of a rigorously formal German photographic duo with her husband, Bernd Becher. Nearly 50 years later, Shore can still remember her reaction. “She looked at them and said: ‘So, Stephen, you want to photograph every main street.’ I replied, ‘No, Hilla, that’s what you want to do. I want to photograph the quintessential main street.’”To do that, Shore made several road trips across the country, photographing main streets, but also car parks, road signs, gas stations and shopfronts as well as the furniture in his rented motel rooms and the food he had for breakfast. The results appeared later in two influential photo books, Uncommon Places and American Surfaces. In them, Shore had captured not just the quintessential main street, but a quintessential America, both familiar and unsettling in its surface sameness. “I wanted,” he says now, “to somehow get to my perception of the underlying quality of the American landscape.”Together, they amounted to a new topography of the vernacular American landscape, his style in places approximating what came to be known as the snapshot aesthetic, in other places adhering to a detached, almost neutral formalism that only added to the deadpan everydayness of his images. Shore later described his democratic approach thus: “To see something ordinary, something you’d see every day, and recognise it as a photographic possibility – that’s what I’m interested in.” Though dismissed at the time by many critics, his style has been enduringly influential and he is now recognised as one of the greatest living photographers.His approach was singular, not least for the amount of thought he put into depicting the seemingly ordinary. “I have always been interested in everyday experience,” he says, “It relates to an idea I had back then of what it might be like to pay attention to the average moments in your life, rather than just the dramatic moments. Attentiveness is self-awareness – you are aware of yourself paying attention. It was a different experience and I was nourished by it. I still am.”While making the work that became Uncommon Places, Shore’s attentiveness was further honed by his decision to use a large-format 8x10-inch camera. “It’s unlike any other camera,” he says. “It’s unwieldy. You have to physically lift it up on its tripod and move it to get the shot you want. That alone makes any decision you make very clear and visceral. The camera is no longer an extension of your eye it’s this tool that is outside of you.”Perhaps for this reason, Shore also carried a small 35mm Leica on his travels, allowing him to shoot more freely and instinctively. Now, having finally revisited those long unseen images, he has produced a new photobook, Transparencies: Small Camera Works, 1971-1979. It is intriguing, not least because the America that emerges from it seems quintessentially Stephen Shore and yet somehow different: the style less formal, the tone more intimate and spontaneous.There is, too, a distinct aura that emanates from these pictures, a sense of another America, recognisable but distant, that seems at times luminous in its very everydayness. This is not just to do with time passing, but with the singular quality of the Kodachrome colour slide film he was using, which, according to Shore, “is the sharpest film that Kodak ever made”.It also allowed him to home in on illuminating details: an elaborately embossed cowboy boot, a garishly patterned tie, a pair of scuffed brown shoes discarded on a fading orange mat. He captured shadows falling on city streets and, in a single dramatic moment, a cloud of thick smoke billowing ominously over a country road. There are several snapshot-like pictures of bad art hanging in drab commercial interiors, as well as signage of every kind, from the makeshift to the stylish: an unfinished US that seems by turns charming and downbeat.Elsewhere, it seems as if the country is unfolding before him, a flow of fast-food joints, freeways, roadside stores and billboards. Did he set out, like Robert Frank before him, to look for the tarnished soul of America? “Well, I was more fascinated by it than critical of it,” he says, “I had no political axe to grind. I felt more like an explorer.”For his first road trip, he tells me, laughing, he purchased a safari-style suit from Abercrombie \u0026amp Fitch, which was then a traditional sporting and outdoors outfitter – “It was where you went if you were going on an African safari or fly fishing in Norway.” For his later trips, he wore a jump suit. ”Back then,” he says, laughing, “they just seemed to me like the right outfits to wear if you were going to drive around exploring America for three months with a camera.”Did he draw much attention in his safari suit, lugging an old-fashioned plate camera on a tripod? “Strangely, no,” he says. “No one seemed to care at all that I was standing there, maybe six feet away, waiting for the light to change so I could photograph them. Often, they were more concerned when I was wandering about with the Leica. People would often chase me off their lawns and sidewalks.”Shore’s interest in photography began in childhood, when he was given a Kodak Junior darkroom set by a thoughtful uncle on his sixth birthday. He bought his first photography book, Walker Evans’s classic American Photographs, aged 10, and, at 14, cold-called the esteemed Edward Steichen, curator of photography at Moma in New York, to ask whether he could show him some work. “I didn’t know you were not supposed to do that sort of thing,” Shore told me, laughing. His precociousness paid off, however, and Steichen purchased three photographs, though they have yet to be exhibited there.Shore’s next port of call was Andy Warhol’s Factory in New York. Having turned up unannounced, Shore hung out at the studio for three years, photographing between long bouts of “sitting around on couches waiting for something to happen”. In 1971, he became the first living photographer to have an exhibition at the politan Museum of Art in New York, showing a sequence of early black and white images. A year later, he arranged 200 unframed Kodak colour snapshots in grids on the walls of the city’s Light gallery. The exhibition was met with bemusement and consternation from critics, visitors and other photographers, including Paul Strand, then in his 80s, who later told him that “higher emotions could not be communicated in colour”.Strand and Shore had conflicting views on the function of photography indicative of a wider generational shift in attitude – a move away from traditional pictorialism towards new ways of seeing that embraced colour and the more knowing strategies of conceptual art.Before Shore embarked on the first of his many road trips, he made a tentative series of colour pictures in Union, New Jersey in 1971, six of which appear in Transparencies. In a way, they are a small, pivotal moment that prefigures the bigger one. “They were all taken at funny angles like I was shooting out of a car window, which I wasn’t,” he explains. “What I was trying to do was take pictures that looked like they weren’t composed. I wanted to get away from the visual conventions of photography, the weight of tradition that informed how you were supposed to structure a photograph. Basically, I wanted to take screwy pictures, but intentionally screwy pictures.”Now aged 72, Stephen Shore is still interested in the possibilities of what might be called democratic photography. He posts a daily iPhone photo on Instagram, where he has 171,000 followers. Over the past few weeks, he has posted pictures of his dog, Wally, a cute Havanese, his compost, a frozen lake, ice-covered branches, a portrait of Debbie Harry and several snaps of the interior of his car.“It means I work every day,” he says. “It can be diaristic or it can just be pictures I find interesting. I recently posted a picture of the steering wheel of my car and someone commented something along the lines of: “Jeez, you’ve finally run out of subject matter.” So, I replied: ‘Yep, that’s it exactly.’ I think most people understand my Instagram feed is not my gallery.”In his 2017 Moma retrospective, he included three years of his Instagram pictures. “People flew in from different parts of the world for the opening, he enthuses, “and they all knew each other from Instagram. It’s amazing in a way. I’m interested in visual thinking, and there is something very personal and revealing about this kind of visual thinking that I just find fascinating.” Still curious, still engaged, Stephen Shore’s way of seeing remains singular and defiantly democratic.• Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971–1979 is out this month (Mack, £50).

There is no need to fake enthusiasm or force yourself to go the extra mile when the business in hand is very much your business.”Admittedly, all the companies in the report have grown since becoming employee-owned and have yet to suffer the kind of sales decline and cost increases that have put John Lewis on the rack. But many have disaster planning in place – or at least plans to cope with a contraction in sales – that staff have been involved in compiling, which has in turn made workers feel more secure.Employee ownership usually starts with a gift. John Lewis handed the Peter Jones department store to workers in the 1920s. Employee ownership at the engineering firm Arup and the chemicals firm Scott Bader, named after Ernest Bader and his wife, Dora Scott, date back more than 50 years, while more recent examples include Richer Sounds, donated by founder Julian Richer, and Riverford Organic Farmers, the vegetable-box provider started by farmer Guy Singh-Watson.Liberal Democrat influence in David Cameron’s coalition government translated into improved tax breaks for owners and staff, but the wider adoption of employee ownership has been slow. The Employee Ownership Association set up an inquiry into the ways different ownership structures affect a curse of the modern workplace: low productivity. Since the 2008 financial crash, Britain’s productivity rate – the output of each worker per hour – has failed to rise more than a fraction.Could the traditional joint stock company with absentee owners be holding back productivity in an era when people want more from time at work than just a pay packet? Part of the inquiry examined how smaller employee-owned firms functioned to see if they, too, suffered from the low investment and sluggish output that characterised what Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane calls “zombie firms” dragging down the UK productivity rate.The report’s author, Stefan Stern, chose four businesses for his study: Community Dental Services, a worker buyout from the NHS based in Sharnbrook, near Bedford Childbase Partnership, a nurseries business based in Newport Pagnell, near Milton Keynes Union Industries, a maker of industrial doors, based in Hunslet on the edge of Leeds and Gripple, a manufacturer of wires and cables, based in Sheffield.Stern, a business writer and former head of the High Pay Centre, which monitors executive remuneration, says he put together focus groups made up of 10-12 colleagues working at all levels in their businesses. The report is due out in a couple of weeks. “What do the workers tell us? That employee ownership binds colleagues together, supports innovation, enterprise and risk-taking, wins engagement and commitment, and rewards people well for their efforts.” Stern says he “kicked the tyres” of each organisation and couldn’t find anyone who wasn’t positive. . Workers can buy shares under some structures (and be loaned the money to do so) or be gifted them. Either way, they end up owning the business.“Employee ownership is not necessarily an easy option, especially when a business changes from a more conventional ownership structure. But it was quite hard to elicit serious criticisms or concerns from these witnesses, none of whom seemed to want to go back to working for any of their previous employers,” he says.The nearest comparison in the mainstream corporate world in terms of holding staff close is probably Toyota, the world’s largest car maker. Its management, developed by its founder, puts workers into teams and gives them responsibilities for monitoring standards, incorporating new ideas and developing new products.Even looser structures seem to occur in worker-owned businesses, as staff question traditional command-and-control management methods.“Employee ownership is clearly liberating for many workers,” says Stern. “But with that freedom to operate comes responsibility, accountability and a genuine sense of ownership – the benefits which accrue from that, but also the seriousness that goes with it. Taking ownership means thinking harder about how you work and how you make money.”A survey of managers at the same businesses, released this week, showed they need to make an even bigger leap, shedding any bombast and egotistical tendencies on their way to the boardroom.As Mike Thompson, founder and chairman of Childbase Partnership, says: “You have to understand, as a leader of an employee-owned business, that you have to be able to make it not about yourself. It has to be about the people.”Under the heading “letting go”, Stern says it is counter-productive to be bossy.Alison Reid, chief executive of Community Dental Services, says: “People know what they need to do on the ground, and we need to create this structure that enables them, that doesn’t fetter them, and so trying to free that up was a really important part of our approach.”There is a recognition that some decisions take longer when the staff are more involved. For instance, setting aside the cash to open new outlets is a move that will need more than a quick board meeting. But hundreds of decisions are taken every day by middle managers in conventional businesses without much concern that anyone wants to waste money or embark on crazy escapades.“The issue with autocratic leadership is if everyone goes through you, then you are the bottleneck,” according to Andrew Lane, managing director of Union Industries. “We like to think that we do the big checks but let people get on with it ... I’ve only got so much time in the day to ask for something.”This is important when growth is hurtling along. Gripple has 700 employees and a turnover of £90m. Half its staff are in the UK and half are overseas.“We set out in 2016 a 2021 plan of getting to £100m turnover. And in 2016 it meant to hit that target we had to generate £25m of products that didn’t exist,” he said.This kind of drive can appear intimidating to any worker who just wants a nine-to-five job and no responsibility beyond their immediate tasks. That can easily be dispelled when word gets around that profits can increase several-fold and bonuses can be taken tax-free up to £3,500 a year.Stern says that a sector with a £30bn turnover and hundreds of successful companies needs to be taken more seriously across the economy. If that happens, in the future there could be more employee-owned household names to stand alongside John Lewis and Waitrose.“If we lose someone it is usually in the first year and it often happens because they can’t cope with the flat structure and open environment,” he says. “It means that when we recruit we focus as much on how the person will fit in as on their skill set.”Revill manages an in-house marketing and video department that most firms would outsource.He studied media production at the University of Lincoln and went straight into a job making videos for the steel maker Corus. He joined £90m-turnover Gripple Automation in Sheffield to do much the same, but persuaded his bosses to widen the department’s remit as the firm expanded abroad. “There is a huge level of trust that what I asked for has been worked through as an idea. And when it doesn’t work, that we will do something about it. It’s in all our interests that we constantly review what we do.”Two of the eight people in his department sit on a board of the Glide group, which oversees Gripple and five other businesses, all employee-owned since the founder handed over the business to his staff in 2011. “They see all the financial details of the groups and discuss strategic objectives. It is great for their development and careers to be so involved,” he says.Trade unions are considered irrelevant in employee-owned businesses, but Angela Brown comes closest to the role of shop steward.As chair of the partnership council at the nursery business Childbase, she speaks regularly to the 44 workers that represent staff on each nursery site.Childbase’s founder, Mike Thompson, began shifting the firm’s ownership to its employees in 2000 with a succession of share issues. In 2017, the workers agreed to move to a fully owned trust structure with everyone owning the same stake.One reason, says Brown, followed concerns that lower-paid staff could ill afford to buy shares each year, even under tax-free schemes.The reps meet every three months, “but everyone knows they can ring me when they have a question,” she says.“We have been asked about pay levels and gone back to reassess them, and after that things have changed. But that is a benefit to the organisation.“If your team isn’t happy, that is going to be a problem for the manager, so talking it through is important.”Brown, a former deputy nursery manager, joined eight years ago, thinking she would stay just a year or so. But the business, she says, encourages leadership through devolved decision-making and offering education and skills training.“When you are engaged you care about what happens, but that doesn’t mean someone can’t switch off when they go home. I do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb545fd0ec4994bbb4cf21148e98b8d25d0997d/0_333_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa0c11097474b69c242fa7f3bc7408e","title":"john lewis launches hand me down clothing drive","story":"Retailer seeks to cut fashion waste with children’s coats featuring reusable name tagsJohn Lewis is tackling fashion waste by launching a hand-me-down drive with extended name labels attached to children’s coats that can be easily amended by parents.The department store chain is introducing organic cotton labelling inside its own-brand children’s coats so the new owner can cross out the name of the last person and write a new name. Coats have been chosen to test this labelling because they have a long life and are often the most costly garment for parents.A new slogan – “Wear it, love it, hand it down” – is also appearing on all cardboard labels attached to the retailer’s entire ranges of own-brand babywear and childrenswear.Baby and childrenswear represent a disproportionate amount of the thousands of tonnes of clothing in landfill because children quickly outgrow their clothing, typically moving up seven sizes in their first two years. As well as the high cost and limited life, mass production of garments places huge pressure on the environment through waste, water consumption and carbon emissions. Britons bin about 300,000 tonnes of clothing a year.Caroline Bettis, the head childrenswear buyer at John Lewis, said: “We’re proud of the quality of our clothes and want them to have a really long life and be handed down again and again. “We hope these new labels will help to grow the culture of handing down clothes which can be worn again by other children.”The retailer will also from next week further extend its fashion “buyback” trial covering any worn and unwanted clothing from its customers – including underwear and old socks – to five more stores and a Waitrose branch.In an initiative first trialled at its Oxford store, customers who bring back unwanted womenswear and menswear brands stocked at John Lewis \u0026amp Partners will receive £3 per item, up to a maximum of three items, off any purchase made that day. To take part customers need to have a John Lewis loyalty card.Among other high-street clothing recycling initiatives, the fashion retailer Monsoon has also introduced a “Love. Wear. Recycle” label.In another solution to the high turnover of barely worn babygrows and vests, families are saving time and money by renting or hiring clothing “bundles”. Subscribers pay a monthly subscription to companies such as Bundlee and Belles and Babes which offer ethical-branded, age-appropriate clothes and receive new outfits in the post. The clothes, washed, ironed and ready to be worn again, are sent back when the child has outgrown them, with another bundle arriving soon after.• This article was amended on 29 February 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described the John Lewis “buyback” initiative being trialled in six stores and a Waitrose branch as involving home collection. The text has been changed to correctly describe the scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974c0d5bbcb57112c8f4f88d408b3209d0096a2b/0_42_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29c6fc78c43cc9274f6767116e00da1e","title":"dear carrie symonds dominic cummings is more bogeyman than babysittter","story":"Congratulations to Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, and of course to the father, prime minister, Boris Johnson.As no doubt many will be quick to remind her, Ms Symonds will soon be looking after two big babies – one presumably less prone to embarrassing red-faced tantrums than the other, but we shall see.While one hesitates to proffer unwanted advice, as a seasoned mother of two, could I politely suggest that Johnson’s aide, Dominic Cummings, not be the very first choice for babysitter, should the exhausted couple need a night out?For a start, Cummings’ hoodies would need to go straight into the sterilising nappy bucket, and the thought of a man who resembles the Incel-Gollum putting his own spin on The Tale of Peter Rabbit chills the blood (“Seems to me that Mr McGregor was well within his rights, kiddo”).

Certainly, young people who don’t go to university remain far worse off, whether inadequately catered for in terms of apprenticeships, or harassed into dead-end, low-skilled low-income employment. However, older generations need to acknowledge that even those young people who make it to university are having a markedly different, more stressful and, above all, financially fixated and economically shaped experience than students of the past.That’s why I feel embarrassed – at my own relatively easy ride. I was skint, squatting and working throughout my degree, but the education was free, I received a full grant, and was encouraged to study what I was interested in.Did I appreciate any of this at the time? Did I hell, but I should have done. This goes beyond money, and into the territory of educational-cum-vocational freedoms, and whether those are becoming reframed as unaffordable luxuries – not just by debt-raddled students but also by a government over-keen to promote subjects that “pay” at the expense of others.While it is only fair for students to know which degrees are more lucrative, churning out lawyers, medics and economists is not the sole purpose of academia. Ministers should not feel justified in further increasing pressure by pronouncing obviously valuable subjects (literature, art, drama, languages) “low value” and unworthy of funding. The government makes money from taxing higher-earning graduates so, while there’s no wishing tuition fees away, there is some justification for lowering them for struggling students, and not just for approved (ie, profitable) courses.The higher-education conversation has moved on – this is no longer just about losing the right to study for free in money terms, but about feeling able to make educational choices on grounds other than economic ones.As for older generations who didn’t have to deal with any of this, let’s at least have the grace to count ourselves lucky.What’s the point of stressing and demoralising job seekers to the point of psychological collapse? A study by Liverpool University, published in the Lancet Public Health, found that the introduction of universal credit across the UK was related to a 6.6 percentage point increase in jobseekers’ mental health issues, compared with the employed or retired. The findings, based on interviews with 52,000 people between 2009 and 2018, are equivalent to 63,674 claimants being affected by stress.The study didn’t include disabled people who claim other benefits – one can only imagine how anxious they are. Regarding universal credit, the stress is multifaceted – caused by anything from the five-week wait to receive benefits, to mounting debts and falling behind with rent, to being hit with sanctions and punishments, and having benefits withdrawn.The most shocking thing is that it doesn’t seem that shocking any more. Last year, a study by Newcastle and Teesside universities found some low-income claimants in the north-east of England had considered suicide. Indeed, nothing about this mess is surprising, considering that the widely criticised welfare system changes have resulted in less money for claimants to live on, and a much more difficult time accessing it.To add to the senselessness, the Liverpool study estimates that around a third of those affected are likely to become clinically depressed. These people would need to eventually seek help, putting more pressure on the NHS.So, this amounts to psychologically damaging people in one part of the system, and using taxpayers’ money to treat them in another. What a bleak, shaming merry-go-round, and one that the Conservatives would doubtless cheerfully continue to facilitate, rather than sort out what has become a cruel, incomprehensible, inefficient welfare system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e768843e67996b6baf62612d0df45d066b147753/974_1376_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5430c6921ee13e85d9df4b682088b33","title":"it is official tory austerity has stifled lives untold poor britons","story":"The finality of the grave brings clarity. On the tombstone of this administration the epitaph should read: “Here lies the Conservative party, it brought death to the country it claimed to love. It killed the working class it claimed to represent. It said it was for the north but wouldn’t keep northerners alive.”Sir Michael Marmot’s review of health and inequality confirms what you already suspected. But suspecting is one thing and knowing another. Marmot shows that England is now the sick man of Europe with such authority and cool precision, he replaces doubt with certainty and transforms the way you think about your country.From the end of the 19th century, life expectancy increased by one year every four years for men and every five-and-a-half years for women. Since David Cameron took power in 2010, the steady improvement in the condition of England has stalled and in the case of the poorest gone into reverse. And people say Cameron will only be remembered for Brexit.The Health Foundation, which supported the research, can show that the Tories’ new seats in the north have lower average healthy life expectancies – that is, life without chronic illnesses – than Labour seats. It implies it would be a blessing if Johnson decided that he had a political interest in changing that. I hope he does but I have my doubts, despite Johnson wanting to end austerity and the NHS cooing about its commitment to tackling health inequalities.The Conservatives have already taken decisions that will have monstrous consequences. The hard Brexit they favour will hit the poorest regions hardest, and they show no signs of caring. The next phase of universal credit will capture 750,000 sick and disabled people, many of whom do not have the cognitive skills to negotiate the system. The culture of Tory England matters as much as its political decisions. Ever since the Brexit referendum I’ve written about the folly of allowing journalists to run a country. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are not merely journalists but the worst type of hacks: crowd-pleasing, dilettante opinionators, performing bullshitters, who do not see wilful stupidity as a source of shame but as a smart career move. It’s not just that they can picture the ignorant attacks from the right that a policy of improving the national health would bring: they’ve written them themselves.Jon Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, makes the point well. He noticed that the Marmot inquiry found that mortality rates have increased for 45- to 49-year-olds. In the US these “deaths of despair” have attracted huge interest, particularly after the death rates for middle-aged white men began to reach the level of their African- and Native-American contemporaries. The same phenomenon can be seen here among middle-aged men (deaths of despair among women are also rising, but less quickly). Now suppose that the government considered curbing alcoholism with minimum prices, health warnings and an advertising ban. Johnson and Gove would know their own words on the nanny state would be thrown in their faces.Hardly anyone has noticed that there has been no great pressure from Labour to relieve the health crisis. It may have shouted loudly about food banks and passed its conscience round for the public to applaud. But over the protests of Ashworth and others, Corbynism remained a thoroughly bourgeois movement. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, at the last election Labour preferred to spend “considerably more” on making up the pensions of “relatively well off” Waspi women than on alleviating the all too genuine despair of the working poor.Write like this and one is in danger of falling into the journalism of despair. So I will end with an upbeat question. This cannot go on – can it? The British don’t expect much from their politicians. But is it too much to ask that they stop trying to kill us?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f94ed0f2082748d2fad4fcab457fd5bc965ea385/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef6c853389f2340c9a4ca5ecaeecada2","title":"rishi sunak reality check yorkshire tea simon armitage charlotte awbery","story":"Let’s call it a brew-haha. When Rishi Sunak tweeted a picture of himself “making tea for the team” as he prepared for his first budget as chancellor, he also whacked in a free and, by all accounts unexpected, endorsement of Yorkshire Tea.Posing with a gigantic packet of teabags, plus six mugs, and a pot that clearly only holds about three cups’ worth, which made me suspect a potentially catastrophic “piss-weak” scenario was playing out in front of my eyes, he added: “Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew” – a little bonus track for his constituents.This being 2020, a simple picture of a boss doing the tea round and showing off about it – a scene that can be witnessed daily in offices around the nation – turned into a drawn-out, brand-based crisis not experienced since Kendall Jenner solved racism with a can of Pepsi. If Johnny Marr thought that David Cameron saying the Smiths were his favourite band was bad, he’s got nothing on the poor social media managers of this humble tea giant.Yorkshire Tea spent the next few days swatting away a swarm of angry boycott-promising tea-drinkers by insisting that it was only a simple tea, not a conduit for the frankly gaga fury of our polarised age, and that, actually, Jeremy Corbyn also had a cup of Yorkshire Tea once, and please could everyone stop being so horrible.With advance apologies for a sentence nobody wishes to read: Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to join in the fun, posting a picture of himself that can only be described as provocative. He added a link to an article in the Grocer about “uncancelling” a brand, while posing with an open packet of Walkers and a closed can of Pringles, both ready salted, of course, because what else would you expect from the self-certified arbiter of common sense?There is light at the end of this unedifying plain-crisp tea-war tunnel. It seems to have placed the first crack in the grim spread of anthropomorphic brand-based Twitter accounts. I could only ever read companies pretending to be people and hear the words as if said in a fake baby voice, but this seems to have torn away the mask. Brands tweeted at other brands supportively, beginning to acknowledge that they were “social media managers”, human workers, rather than the brand itself posing as some grotesquely sassy cartoon character.I was a Yorkshire Tea drinker before, but by instigating this shift, my loyalty, my loyal tea, has been cemented.Singer Charlotte Awbery’s life changed dramatically when she was accosted by a man on the tube, in a rare instance of that happening in a good way.Awbery was walking to meet a friend when prankster Kevin Freshwater shoved a camera and a microphone in her face and asked her to finish the lyric. He threw the start of Shallow from A Star Is Born at her. She responded by A Star Is Born-ing him, an amateur knocking it out with all the might of a seasoned West End a.What I loved most about the original clip was the moment it turned. You can see that Awbery looks surprised – as you would if a stranger shouted “Finish the lyrics!” at you when you were just trying to have a coffee and catch a train – but she joins in, tentatively at first, clearly a professional singer, clearly nailing it. And then she makes the split-second decision to belt it out, to sing with all the power she can muster, and the freedom of it is almost as brilliant as the passing Londoners being as London as possible, ignoring what is happening in case the joy might be catching.The obligatory endpoint of any heartwarming “gone viral” moment, particularly when it involves music, is an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’s US talk show. Last week DeGeneres got a still-shellshocked Awbery on to sing Shallow in full, then had a quick chat with her afterwards. “I do weddings, I do pubs, bars, restaurants,” Awbery told the host, explaining that her father had told her never to give up. The fact that this might have made a better plot for A Star Is Born than the plot of A Star Is Born only adds to the magic.There should be a word for the unsteadying, uncertain feeling that comes with hovering over the name of a person you admire, when that person’s name is trending on Twitter, because you’re unsure what news the imminent click is about to reveal.Death, scandal or that rare moment of celebration? Happily, Simon Armitage was trending because he had announced that plans were in development for an ambitious national poetry centre in Leeds. There should be a word for the relief that comes when it is a happy case of someone trending positively, but I’m sure those who make the poetry headquarters a place for them will be in the best position to come up with something.Armitage, who is professor of poetry at Leeds University, as well as poet laureate, said that he wants the proposed centre “to bring poetry in line with other national art forms that have their own headquarters and venues, such as the National Theatre and the National Gallery, etc”. It should be outside London, he says, and will make the most of the “incredible renaissance” going on in poetry.A trying week for Yorkshire Tea, then, but an excellent week for Yorkshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/699b19bc6cbe1491f7196eb4e109bb472ce1a650/143_257_3711_2227/master/3711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=715ece4b44119f0f3d238501b39a4df0","title":"no deal brexit rears its ugly head again cartoon","story":"Chris Riddell on Boris Johnson asking the EU for a Canada-style trade deal• You can buy your own print of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d29f5e2aa8ebb32afb2cf06a43b731e816b4135/0_348_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5b8cf3cde405a750b107aafca11cd54","title":"one in five students lose money by going to university ifs finds","story":"Men benefit more than women and creative arts provide worst returns, according to tax dataOne in five students would be financially better off if they skipped higher education, according to groundbreaking research that compares the lifetime earnings of graduates and non-graduates.The IFS research – which uses tax data to measure the earnings of those who went to university from the mid-90s onwards – found that after accounting for taxes and student loans, men gained on average £130,000 and women £100,000 over their careers, compared with their peers who didn’t enter higher education.As well as the total “graduate premium” being different between the sexes, it is also unevenly distributed over time, with women reaching a glass ceiling on earnings growth in their 30s and 40s, even among Oxbridge graduates. The premium also differed depending on the subject studied.The report comes as the government in England is applying additional scrutiny to universities and outcomes for graduates, with some ministers looking to restrict the numbers taking so-called “low-value” courses.Overall, the IFS found the government benefited from extra tax revenue and national insurance contributions of £110,000 per man and £30,000 per woman, over and above the costs of study to the government.“The exchequer gains a lot on average from higher education, despite the high costs of writing off unpaid student loans. That is mainly because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax,” said Ben Waltmann, an IFS economist and co-author of the report.“But this analysis also shows that the government makes an overall loss on financing the degrees of nearly half of all graduates. These losses are concentrated amongst those studying certain subjects.“For creative arts, for example, the losses are substantial. This need not mean that the government is misallocating funds but it is important to be aware of the costs involved.”Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said that while the benefits of higher education included “unquantifiable experiences and friendships,” she was still concerned about value for money.“It is no surprise our universities attract students from all over the world. However, that prestige is built on quality and my role is to work with the regulator to safeguard that, while ensuring students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment,” Donelan said.The Department for Education said the earnings data would define the benefits of higher education and “help students of all ages make smart choices about their future”.However, Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “It is vital to recognise that education is about much more than just financial benefit. Focussing on future income following university ignores the wider benefits that education brings to iniduals and to society.”But while men’s earnings rocketed up from the age of 30, women’s earnings growth was far lower, with childbearing and family formation the most likely factor. The IFS said women “see little difference in average returns” across different universities, while male graduates who attended Oxbridge and Russell Group universities earned more than their peers at other institutions.Jack Britton, another co-author of the report, said: “This work highlights how important the 30s are for graduate men. Rapid earnings growth of male graduates in this period has a large positive impact on their average return to higher education such that three quarters of men end up better off as a result of having done a degree.”The new research is based on annual incomes and fails to take account of hours worked, with non-graduates working longer hours for the same income, according to previous research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801574d804e937a790ae5a1f322bea82c96afbb6/540_142_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a2a9d204b593e0712ba2db28495e54","title":"50 ways to green up your life save the planet","story":"Expert tips on how to be kinder to the planet – from cooking and cleaning to fashion and financeLove your leftoversLook at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says Feast food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, £25), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough.Treat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.”Use tech for goodApps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.Shop little and oftenA lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.”Pick your own“Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.Switch your floursCrops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.”Befriend a butcher“There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. Compost on the goCompost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.”Plan aheadMake the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter.Minimise packagingLook for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.Clean with castileBy making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth.Go for plastic-free personal careThere is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.”Recycle as much as you can“Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap.TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliancesThe Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too.Create clean air“You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas.Change your shower head“Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliersThere are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne.Draught-proof your homeOne of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal.Buy vintage furniture“Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts.Encourage beesHoneybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. Spend less, propagate moreYour own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and ide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbonIn The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” Let the grass growLetting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer.Encourage hedgehogsHedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, £14.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.”Set a barIf a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying.Find a secondhand that works for youOpting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites.Shop in person – and aloneThat said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on.It can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry.Choose materials wiselySome fabrics age better than others the ’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand.Unsubscribe and unfollow“If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too.Get swishingClothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.Make your clothes fitLayla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner.Make your own apron from a pair of old jeansTurn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March).Darn your socks“Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic.Primp your trainersThis is a growing service industry. Gråel in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand’s sneaker-care technicians.Lose the disposablesA staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about £10.Don’t be tempted by minisThose pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them.Embrace bathsBaths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too.Save water and lower your billsConsider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.Get a loan to improve your home’s energy efficiencySome lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures.Choose an environmentally friendly current accountNearly £150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide.Invest wisely“Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” Evaluate your pension“For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus.Get a green financial adviserLast year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,” MacDonald says.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc86e98ddddcd93ad50b885e8e8d8d6e4b5f3027/0_0_1588_1139/master/1588.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df5922475ac9fc756f996f903da3c1de 660w","title":"tell us have you not bought clothes for more than 10 years","story":"We’re interested in hearing from people who haven’t bought any clothes for the last 10 years Konnie Huq has revealed that she hasn’t bought any clothes in 10 years.

His mouth froths. He gets so excited that he spills some of his lemon and ginger tea on the floor of the photo studio we’re sitting in. “Oh dear,” he says, Iggy Pop transforming rapidly into an extremely apologetic, polite young man. “I’m just going to wipe that up with my bum.” And so he does – sliding across the floor while his black trousers soak up the drink.A polite young man George MacKay might be, but at just 27 he’s had plenty of practice trying on other personas: a closeted gay activist in Pride, a singing Scottish squaddie in Sunshine On Leith and – most recently – Lance Corporal Will Schofield in Sam Mendes’ first world war smash, 1917. He is soon to play the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in True History Of The Kelly Gang, which is where today’s unlikely punk outburst comes in: director Justin Kurzel wanted his young actors to put a punky spin on the tale of the Aussie folk hero, so he booked a gig venue and told them to perform their own songs live as a punk band. MacKay is treating me to one of his self-penned numbers.“We put on dresses and rubbed ash in our eyes,” he recalls of the performance by the resulting band, Fleshlight. MacKay came up with the name: “It’s a… it’s a sort of… sex toy that you can, um, unscrew and, er, make love to,” he says, his bashfulness further proof that Iggy has left the building.MacKay adores this immersive way of working – not just researching but living his roles. To prepare for True History Of The Kelly Gang, he lived in the bush, bulking up by chopping wood and riding horses. Sadly, not every aspect of physical transformation was as easy to achieve: the outlaw Kelly was renowned for his manly whiskers, yet baby-faced MacKay struggled to grow any facial hair. “I honestly thought I was going to lose the part,” he says.What did his attempt at a beard look like?They tried a stick-on beard but Kurzel wasn’t convinced. Then the director had a brainwave – what could be more punk rock than playing Australia’s hairiest antihero with baby-smooth cheeks? “Just grow a mullet instead,” came the instructions, which MacKay managed.Fortunately, no facial fuzz was needed for 1917, in which MacKay’s role – alongside another relatively little-known actor (Dean-Charles Chapman) – was to be a young man in an old man’s war. The story follows the two soldiers on their mission to carry a vital message deep behind enemy lines. Again, MacKay threw himself into the part: army boot camps, six months of rehearsals, understanding the function of every bit of archaic military kit. The Oscar-winning film was famously shot in “one take” (in reality, very long takes – some of them almost 10 minutes – stitched together) and the last thing anyone needed was to get seven minutes into a take, only for the safety catch on a rifle to jam.Sometimes, though, mistakes were encouraged. In one epic scene, MacKay hurtles down the frontline while allied troops emerge over the trenches he gets floored by one soldier, something that wasn’t scripted. “When everyone’s blood’s up and the bombs are going off, that happens,” MacKay says. “Sam wanted it to be natural and alive, so he kept it.”As an actor, MacKay is already something of a war veteran: he’s fought the first world war three times, and the second world war twice. For him, this has meant delving into an awful lot of history books, including harrowing first-person accounts. “We talk about seeing the inside of a person in a spiritual or figurative sense,” he says. “But these people would really see it. To see someone’s organs, or their bone split and poke out. Picking up a friend’s leg and it coming away…” He shudders.At the same time, he is keen to stress that being an actor is nothing like being a soldier. “I hope this isn’t a terribly misjudged thing to say,” he caveats at one point, and, “This is only my extremely cushy version of it.” But he does note some parallels: there is the sense of brotherhood on a film set the returning home after an experience that nobody else has been through the sense of pushing yourself beyond normal limits. MacKay’s 1917 character, Schofield, is a quiet soul who bottles up his emotions as a way of forgetting his life back home, and MacKay thinks he did something similar while working on True History Of The Kelly Gang.MacKay grew up in Barnes, a villagey suburb of south-west London on the bank of the Thames. His parents (his mother is a costume designer, his father a lighting and stage director) sent him to the independent Harrodian school, which encouraged his love of drama. By the time he was 10, MacKay had his first acting job, and was whisked away to Australia for eight months to play Curly, one of the lost boys in PJ Hogan’s 2003 version of Peter Pan. Back in London, he got on with the business of becoming a normal teenager: “I didn’t really talk about it much,” he shrugs.His career hasn’t been all plain sailing. He failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but refused to be disheartened: “I decided the next job I got, I was going to actively learn and listen, and look for jobs that could facilitate the learning I would have done there.” And so he picked roles that pushed him to new places. The part he wanted more than anything was that of Edmond in the 2013 postapocalyptic teen drama How I Live Now – because he wanted to learn from its director Kevin Macdonald and then rising star Saoirse Ronan. “I was 20, had spent a year not working, and I knew she was this amazing actress,” he says. “Even back then, she was a trailblazer.”The two ended up dating while on set (“I suspected what was going on but they kept it very quiet,” Macdonald would later say), which must have made finding the onscreen chemistry a bit easier.“Yeah,” he says. “I just admire that woman so much. She’s an amazing human being, but that’s all I can say.”Does he make a habit of falling for his co-stars? “It seems obvious that, if that’s who you’re spending time with, and who you’re getting to know, that’s how we meet everyone,” he deflects. “It’s not a constant through-line but we all meet people some way, either at work or in a pub.”Is he single at the moment? “I can’t say.”He is less cautious when it comes to picking his parts. MacKay’s cross-dressing Ned Kelly, for instance, is charged with sexual energy: there’s a homoerotic frisson between him and Nicholas Hoult, who plays a young constable interested in Kelly’s sister and his relationship with his onscreen mother (played by the director’s wife, Essie Davis) would make Freud blush. As MacKay puts it, “It’s a beautiful, weird oedipal relationship where he’s the little boy to his mum but he’s also her man, and she’s his greatest woman and greatest love.”Playing characters such as Lutz and Kelly has made him “think a little bit harder” about social constructs, he says, specifically ones that have benefited him. “I am recognising that I have never, as a white male, felt like I couldn’t walk into a room,” he says. “It’s a wonderful thing to feel confident. So it’s been a brilliant realisation to be, like, wow, that’s not a feeling that everyone feels? Not everyone feels they could get cast for this? Why, subconsciously, do I feel that confidence – and other people subconsciously feel inferior?”In an interview last year, MacKay said that he wanted to be more political in his life and work, but his innate caution and fear of offending means he probably won’t usurp Joaquin Phoenix in the wild outburst charts any time soon. When I ask which way he votes, he flushes, looks panicked and, after a pause that seems to hang in the air, puts his hand to his chest and says he would prefer to keep that private. He wants to say the right things about ersity in Hollywood, and equal pay, too, but when we try there are so many false starts – an avalanche of ums and ahs – that watching him try to answer each question feels almost cruel.“Sorry, I’m not really articulating myself,” he says. “I’m just trying to be careful. I should know the answers to these things, for myself more than anyone.”A few weeks after we meet, 1917 wins big at the Baftas, scooping seven awards including best film, best director and best cinematographer for veteran film-maker Roger Deakins. MacKay presents an award with Dean-Charles Chapman, who has been by his side almost constantly over several intense months of publicity-blitzing around the globe. The actors look nervously out at the crowd before MacKay asks if this is still part of Deakins’ continuous take. Unlike most presenters, they get a genuine laugh.A week later, MacKay is presenting again – this time at the Oscars – and then he is back on a plane to the UK, where he calls me. If he’s exhausted, it doesn’t show. “It was huge,” he enthuses of the Academy Awards. “I grew up watching the results, so to be part of it was overwhelming. Just being in physical proximity, just 10 yards away from Brad Pitt, or Beyoncé, or Scarlett Johansson – and look, there’s Tom Hanks!”But the memory that will stick in his mind is of reuniting with the cast and crew of 1917 at the Bafta after-party: “When we were making the film, everyone was in their gear all the time – either war costumes or boots and rain macs. So to walk into that room and see a huge number of the crew all done up and smiling was the best thing.”It sounds as if he’s got a taste for this kind of thing. He laughs and shrugs off the notion, saying that it was a privilege just to be part of a successful film. But I suspect this is MacKay being the polite young man again. And I suspect there will be plenty more plaudits coming his way – probably before he’s managed to grow a proper beard.● True History Of The Kelly Gang is out nowIf you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9949ea75fb0d6525c76273996b77eb597dee5598/0_1292_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c8de3e0df8a6536a64ab0dd4641a10","title":"yotam ottolenghi winter vegetable recipes celeriac cafe de paris sauce tomato barley stew tunisian potato beans","story":"Spring may be around the corner, but there’s still time to enjoy winter veg in the form of celeriac steaks, barley stew and a Tunisian potato and butter bean stewWith spring officially three weeks away, ingredients that provide ballast are still very much the order of the day. Starchy root veg – potatoes, kohlrabi, celeriac – bring both sustenance and reassurance that, at this time of the year, it’s OK for our raw materials to be pasty-white, knobbly-kneed and slightly hairy – nothing that a lick of oil and a bit of heat won’t sort out.So enjoy the delights of hibernation for a while longer yet. Stack the shelves with jars of creamy butter beans, briny capers, salty anchovies and nutty barley. Fill the fridge with soft herbs, rich cream and sweet little tomatoes.And keep lemons in a bowl on the counter as a daily reminder that the sun – spring! – is just around the corner.Bkeila is a Tunisian Jewish condiment made by cooking lots of spinach in lots of oil for many hours, leaving you with a very dark, intense paste that’s traditionally used to flavour soups and stews. This version is simpler – less oil, fewer hours – but it still delivers on the flavour front. It will keep in the fridge for up to three days or in the freezer for up to a month.Prep 35 minCook 1 hr 10 minServes 4 as a main course80g coriander, plus 20g extra to serve, roughly chopped30g parsley600g baby spinach120ml olive oil, plus extra to serve1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 green chillies, finely chopped (pith and seeds removed if you like less heat)1¼ tbsp ground cumin1 tbsp ground coriander¾ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp caster sugar2 lemons – 1 juiced, to get 2 tbsp, the other cut into wedges, to serve1 litre vegetable stock (chicken stock would work, too)Salt500g waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm pieces1 x 700g jar cooked large butter beans (425g drained weight) – we use the Navarrico ones from BrindisaIn a food processor, pulse the coriander, parsley and spinach in batches, until finely chopped (or do so by hand), then scrape into a bowl.Put 75ml oil in a large, heavy-based pot on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry gently, stirring occasionally, for eight minutes, until soft and golden.Add the garlic, chilli and spices, and cook, stirring regularly, for six minutes. Turn up the heat to high, add the chopped spinach mix and three more tablespoons of oil, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until the spinach turns a dark green, almost grey colour. You want it to catch a bit, but not to burn, so turn down the heat if need be.Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, stock and two teaspoons of salt, scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula as you do so. Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat to medium, add the potatoes and cook gently for 25 minutes, until they are soft all the way through. Stir in the butter beans and cook for five minutes, until warmed through.Off the heat, stir in the roughly chopped extra coriander, then ide the stew between four bowls. Drizzle over some more oil and serve with the lemon wedges.It turns out that roasting whole celeriac for the best part of three hours with lots of oil and salt makes it taste very “meaty”. This isn’t what any card-carrying Parisian would recognise as steak with Café de Paris sauce, I know, but it is a punchy, meat-free alternative.Prep 20 minCook 2 hr 45 minServes 4 as a main course2 large celeriac, hairy roots discarded and scrubbed clean – no need to peel (1.8kg net weight) 120ml olive oil, plus extra, if neededFlaked salt and black pepperFor the sauce110g unsalted butter, cut into 2cm cubes 1 small banana shallot, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed3 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped (optional, but adjust the salt if not using)½ tsp medium curry powder¼ tsp cayenne powder1 tbsp mustard powder1 tbsp baby capers2 tbsp finely chopped chives 2 tbsp finely chopped tarragon leaves1 tbsp finely chopped parsley leaves2 tsp thyme leaves2 tsp lemon juice 110ml single or whipping creamHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)375Fgas 5. Pierce each celeriac all over with a fork about 40 times and put them on an oven tray lined with baking paper. Mix the oil with a tablespoon of flaked salt, then rub this all over the celeriac. Roast the celeriac for at least two hours and 15 minutes, or up to two hours and 45 minutes, depending on their size, basting them in the oil every 20 minutes or so, until the celeriac is deeply browned all over, soft all the way through and oozing “caramel”. Leave to rest for 15 minutes, then cut each celeriac widthways into 2½cm-thick steaks and brush all over with any oil left on the tray.Put the first seven ingredients for the sauce and a half-teaspoon of flaked salt in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Cook, swirling the pan, for six minutes, until the shallots have softened and the butter has melted and turned golden. Add the capers, herbs and a very generous grind of pepper, cook for a minute, then turn off the heat.Turn the grill to its highest setting. Line a large oven tray with greaseproof paper, arrange the celeriac steaks on top in a single layer and spaced well apart, then brush all over with extra oil, if need be. (Make sure there is no overhanging paper, because otherwise it might catch and burn.) Grill the steaks on the top shelf for six to eight minutes, until golden brown on top, then keep warm while you finish the sauce.Return the sauce pot to a medium heat, leave for a minute just to warm through, then add the cream and lemon juice, and swirl the pan around for two minutes, until the sauce is again warm – take care you don’t mix it too much: you want this sauce to stay split, not homogenise.Pour the sauce on to a large platter with a lip and arrange the celeriac steaks on top (or plate them up inidually with the sauce alongside). Sprinkle over a little flaked salt and ground black pepper, and serve hot.Vegans, vegetarians: this dish is easily adaptable to suit you by dropping the anchovies andor the cream – there’s more than enough going on flavourwise for it to work without either. If you do omit the anchovies, however, you’ll need to up the amount of salt.Prep 25 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 4 as a maincourse4 small kohlrabi (1kg), trimmed and peeled4 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped (optional)140ml olive oil1 large whole head garlic, top cut off to expose the bulbs, plus 4 cloves extra, peeled and crushedSalt and black pepper300g sweet, ripe cherry tomatoes, such as datterini300g pearl barley2-3 banana shallots, peeled and finely sliced (120g net)2 tsp caraway seeds2 lemons – 1 zested in 5 fine strips and juiced, to get 2 tbsp, the other cut into wedges, to serve1 red scotch bonnet chilli (optional)3 tbsp tomato paste150ml dry white wine100g watercress60ml double cream (optional)Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)410Fgas 6½. Cut each kohlrabi lengthways into eight 2½cm-wide wedges (if they are on the large side, you may need to cut them into more than eight wedges). Put the kohlrabi in a large bowl, and toss with the anchovies (if using), two tablespoons of oil, half the crushed garlic, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then spread out on a large oven tray lined with baking paper.Drizzle the whole garlic bulb with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle over a little salt and pepper. Wrap the bulb tightly in foil, put it in one corner of the tray, then roast everything for 25 minutes. Turn the kohlrabi wedges, add the tomatoes to the tray, then return to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, until the kohlrabi is softened and browned and the tomatoes are nicely blistered. Keep warm in a low oven (or reheat gently before you serve).When the garlic is cool enough to handle, peel off the foil, squeeze out the flesh from each clove into a small bowl and discard the papery skins.Meanwhile, put the barley in a medium saucepan, add plenty of cold water to cover and put on a medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, turn down the heat and leave to simmer for 20 minutes, until the barley is semi-cooked but still has a good bite, then drain and set aside.While the barley is cooking, put a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a medium-high heat with 50ml oil, the remaining two crushed garlic cloves and all the roast garlic flesh, the shallots, caraway seeds, lemon peel, scotch bonnet (if using) and two and a half teaspoons of salt. Fry gently for 12 minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden brown (turn down the heat if the mix starts to catch). Stir in the tomato paste, cook for 30 seconds, then add the wine, 500ml water and plenty of pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer on a medium heat, cook for seven minutes, then add the drained barley and cook for 10 minutes more, until it swells a little and takes on the flavour of the sauce. Discard the chilli and lemon peel.In a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor, blitz half the watercress with the lemon juice, the remaining 60ml oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, until you have a smooth salsa.Drizzle the watercress salsa and cream (if using) over the barley mixture and gently swirl them in. Top with the remaining watercress and the roast veg, and serve straight from the pan with the lemon wedges alongside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76232fee8b2e2f92f3a1f8828ee9cd841d8d32d3/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20c481d0c40ae7080e5976bd099ba5d1","title":"chelsea women arsenal womens league cup final","story":"A tap-in from Chelsea’s Beth England for her second goal of the final snatched the Continental League Cup trophy from Arsenal at the death, after Leah Williamson looked to have exorcised the ghost of her missed penalty in last season’s shootout by equalising in the 85th minute. Instead it was devastation for Arsenal on the final whistle, though they may take a little consolation from the words of the opposing manager.Emma Hayes said: “The better team did not win the game the most resilient team won the game, and I value defending, and I value resilience.”Sloppy Arsenal defending had allowed England to give Chelsea the lead inside 10 minutes, but Williamson sent the Arsenal bench wild when their heavy spell of pressure looked to have paid off and delivered extra time. This, though, is a Chelsea team that never say die, having come from behind nine times in the Women’s Super League, and up popped England to earn them their first ever League Cup.“We knew that this would be a dominant Arsenal, so to win the game knowing that shows what a great team we really are,” said Hayes, who also singled out Chelsea’s goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger for praise.“She was unbelievable,” said Hayes. “We always talk about attacking being the most dominant feature of a football match instead of saying why don’t Chelsea deserve to win the game on the basis of an outstanding goalkeeping performance. It’s not often we have to defend like that.”When the team sheet arrived there was concern for Arsenal fans. Joe Montemurro could name only four outfield players on his bench, including two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old. Injuries to Beth Mead, Jen Beattie Lia Wälti and the captain, Kim Little, have devastated Arsenal’s squad.There was a sense of deja vu to the narrative. With Montemurro’s penchant for a small squad rocked by a freak injury crisis last season, Arsenal travelled to Bramall Lane for a backs-against-the-wall battle with Manchester City. Then, the unfit Vivianne Miedema was the only senior outfield player seated alongside the manager. This time it was the defender Leonie Maier who could provide the best depth from the dugout.Arsenal were hit by an eighth-minute sucker-punch as left-back Jonna Andersson found right-back Maren Mjelde at the far post. Mjelde headed down to England, who swivelled and struck low past Manuela Zinsberger.However, this was not an Arsenal side likely to buckle as easily as they did at Borehamwood in January, where a 4-1 bruising was kickstarted by a flurry of three goals inside 20 minutes. In a chilly City Ground, Montemurro had ditched his attempt to outfox Hayes by dropping his wingers for a more centrally focused attack, instead restoring much more familiar width to their forward play. It worked.“It could have been a different story,” said Montemurro. “We were badly beaten at Borehamwood. And look at the mental attitude to come back and completely dominate a team that did what they did to us.”Despite their lead, Chelsea looked to be losing the midfield battle. So much so that Hayes could be seen passing notes to Mjelde late in the first half.Perhaps it was emotions getting in the way. This was Chelsea’s first League Cup final and, with Hayes donning a green coat in tribute to idol Brian Clough as promised, it was a title they badly wanted. “The players haven’t got a clue who he is. My sister sent me lists of quotes this morning, my favourite one being this one, she sent me it twice so clearly she wanted me to read it out to you guys: ‘I wouldn’t say I’m the best manager in the business but I’m in the top one.’ Well, I’m there today. I’ll take that,” said Hayes.This is a competition that has been kind to five-time winners Arsenal, and to Montemurro, who lifted it within three months of taking over in 2017. “There are no second chances,” he had said in his programme notes. “The team that controls their emotions and tempo the best will make the least mistakes and most likely win.”They would be words to haunt the manager. Despite the Arsenal forward line flooding the Chelsea half over and over again, the equaliser that would amend for the ropey defending that had allowed England in early on seemed elusive.However, after a lengthy pause for an injury to Berger, Arsenal bounced the resulting corner into the box for Williamson to ert from six yards. It was a short-lived celebration though, with England poking in Mjelde’s cross to kill the Arsenal comeback.“A lot of coaches say: we should have, could have, would have,” said Montemurro. “But in the end, you have to do it. We created chances, we created opportunities, and in the end they scored the ones they created and we didn’t. This team will keep fighting – we showed that today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5ca6d7260a2ae3320d8e7a70bb1ae271e2df7a/111_0_4225_2536/master/4225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=922c000be6dec2efffe746d46bb52257","title":"watford liverpool premier league match report","story":"A sense of inevitability characterises Liverpool’s pursuit of the title but no longer is it one cloaked in invincibility. Yes, that’s right, Jürgen Klopp’s men have lost a Premier League game, 423 days since they last did so, and in a manner that was so complete that its unfolding felt like an almighty trick of the mind. Was this really happening? Was a side that had won their last 18 league games and maintained a 22-point lead at the top of the table really utterly out-thought, outfought and outplayed by opponents fighting relegation? Indeed they were, and then some.Quite simply Liverpool were battered. From first minute until last Watford refused to display any sense of an inferiority complex against esteemed opponents and instead delivered a display of great togetherness, aggression and potency. They scored three and could have had more on a night that will be spoken about in these parts for years to come. That much could be taken from the thunderous roar that greeted the final whistle from the majority of those in attendance. A famous victory for Watford’s supporters to celebrate and one that also lifts their side out of the bottom three on goal difference and gives them renewed belief they can avoid the drop after all.There was no doubting their best performer, either. Making his first start since 18 January having been sidelined with a hamstring injury, Ismaïla Sarr was sensational, scoring Watford’s first two goals, assisting Troy Deeney for the third and generally tormenting Liverpool with his pace, skill and intent from the right wing. The 22-year-old, who joined Watford from Rennes for £25m in the summer, earned a standing ovation from the home fans when substituted on 82 minutes as well as praise from his manager. “He’s a really good player,” said Nigel Pearson in his typically understated manner.Others in yellow and black also caught the eye, most notably Will Hughes and Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield and Gerard Deulofeu up until he had to be substituted on 37 minutes after twisting his knee while challenging Virgil van Dijk for possession.The Spaniard had to be carried off on a stretcher before being taken to hospital. Pearson suggested the 25-year-old could be out for a very lengthy period of time.Deulofeu’s injury aside this was a perfect night for Watford on the back of their best display of what has been a difficult season. Equally, however, there is no denying they were helped towards a first win in seven games by the manner of their opponents’ showing. Liverpool were incredibly poor, playing with a complete lack of cohesion and purpose in attack, while defensively they were, quite frankly, shocking.No one more so in defence than Dejan Lovren who, having been surprisingly selected over Joël Matip in place of the injured Joe Gomez, did little to dispute the idea that he is an accident waiting to happen with the manner in which he let Adam Mesina’s throw-in bounce over his head in the buildup to Watford’s opening goal on 54 minutes.The Croat allowed himself to be put off by Deeney’s presence and it severely cost Liverpool as Doucouré collected possession and put in Sarr who sent the ball past Alisson.Watford’s third goal also came from a Liverpool defensive error as Sarr pounced on Trent Alexander-Arnold’s weak back pass and, under pressure from Alisson, played a pass to Deeney which he placed into a gaping net. For Alexander-Arnold it was a harrowing moment and also a case of going from the sublime to the ridiculous given the excellent display he had delivered in Monday’s win over West Ham.That goal was also the moment the hosts knew they had wrapped up the three points having gone 2-0 up on the hour after Sarr had collected Deeney’s cute pass and, having sped through on goal, coolly lifted the ball over the out‑rushing Alisson.It was a wonderful moment during a wonderful display by the Senegal international whose only regret was that he failed to secure a hat-trick after dragging a relatively easy chance wide of the far post before he was substituted.Liverpool’s threat was all but nonexistent. Adam Lallana hit the post with a long-range strike soon after coming on and, overall, they produced only one shot on target – Andy Robertson’s second-half strike that Ben Foster saved with ease.That, ultimately, was that for the visitors. And while they will no doubt recover and go on to win that first championship in 30 years – they require 12 points from their remaining 10 games to do so – there was no record-breaking 19th consecutive top-flight victory to celebrate here, nor the chance of going the entire campaign unbeaten, something that will no doubt be savoured in the red half of north London in particular.Arsenal’s class of 2004 will not be superseded by Liverpool’s class of 2020 following a night of genuine shock and awe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8453001ac0b7f9b80ccac46e5d535a34486a31/0_167_4822_2894/master/4822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980275baf8673d074e588777d5578bf9","title":"technologys potential for good private gain tech giants machine learning medicine halicin bacteria","story":"The new antibiotic, effective against super-resistant pathogens, is proof that AI can do more than make tech giants richOne of the seminal texts for anyone interested in technology and society is Melvin Kranzberg’s Six Laws of Technology, the first of which says that “technology is neither good nor bad nor is it neutral”. By this, Kranzberg meant that technology’s interaction with society is such “that technical developments frequently have environmental, social and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves, and the same technology can have quite different results when introduced into different contexts or under different circumstances”.The saloon-bar version of this is that “technology is both good and bad it all depends on how it’s used” – a tactic that tech evangelists regularly deploy as a way of stopping the conversation. So a better way of using Kranzberg’s law is to ask a simple Latin question: Cui bono? – who benefits from any proposed or hyped technology? And, by implication, who loses?With any general-purpose technology – which is what the internet has become – the answer is going to be complicated: various groups, societies, sectors, maybe even continents – win and lose, so in the end the question comes down to: who benefits most? For the internet as a whole, it’s too early to say. But when we focus on a particular digital technology, then things become a bit clearer.A case in point is the technology known as “machine learning”, a manifestation of artificial intelligence that is the tech obsession de nos jours. It’s really a combination of algorithms that are “trained” on “big data”, ie huge datasets. In principle, anyone with the computational skills to use freely available software tools such as TensorFlow could do machine learning. But in practice they can’t because they don’t have access to the massive data needed to train their algorithms.This means the outfits where most of the leading machine-learning research is being done are a small number of tech giants – especially Google, Facebook and Amazon – which have accumulated colossal silos of behavioural data over the last two decades. Since they have come to dominate the technology, the Kranzberg question – who benefits? – is easy to answer: they do. Machine learning now drives everything in those businesses – “personalisation” of services, recommendations, precisely targeted advertising, behavioural prediction… For them, AI (by which they mostly mean machine learning) is “everywhere”. And it is making them the most profitable enterprises in the history of capitalism.The team of MIT and Harvard researchers built a neural network (an algorithm inspired by the brain’s architecture) and trained it to spot molecules that inhibit the growth of the Escherichia coli bacterium using a dataset of 2,335 molecules for which the antibacterial activity was known – including a library of 300 existing approved antibiotics and 800 natural products from plant, animal and microbial sources. They then asked the network to predict which would be effective against E coli but looked different from conventional antibiotics. This produced a hundred candidates for physical testing and led to one (which they named “halicin” after the HAL 9000 computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey) that was active against a wide spectrum of pathogens – notably including two that are totally resistant to current antibiotics and are therefore a looming nightmare for hospitals worldwide.There are a number of other examples of machine learning for public good rather than private gain. One thinks, for example, of the collaboration between Google DeepMind and Moorfields eye hospital. But this new example is the most spectacular to date because it goes beyond augmenting human screening capabilities to aiding the process of discovery. So while the main beneficiaries of machine learning for, say, a toxic technology like facial recognition are mostly authoritarian political regimes and a range of untrustworthy or unsavoury private companies, the beneficiaries of the technology as an aid to scientific discovery could be humanity as a species. The technology, in other words, is both good and bad. Kranzberg’s first law rules OK. Every cloud… Zeynep Tufekci has written a perceptive essay for the Atlantic about “how the coronavirus revealed authoritarianism’s fatal flaw”.EU ideas explained Politico writers Laura Kayali, Melissa Heikkilä and Janosch Delcker have delivered a shrewd analysis of the underlying strategy behind recent policy documents from the EU dealing with the digital future.On the nature of loss Jill Lepore has written a knockout piece for the New Yorker under the heading “The lingering of loss”, on friendship, grief and remembrance.

And she knows he approves of the majority of what she subsequently did to the interior, because he revisited last year, during the inaugural Crystal Palace Artists’ Open House, an annual event running over two consecutive weekends, which Jacobs established for the area.Nevertheless, the green of the kitchen walls – Little Greene’s Sage \u0026amp Onions – paired with fresh turquoise on the window frame (Dulux Trade’s Marine Splash) looked so outré when he later spotted it on her Instagram feed, that it prompted a visit from the property agent. “It just meant I had to sign an addendum to my contract saying I will return anything to neutral that my landlord doesn’t like when I leave,” she explains. He may want to reconsider this when the time comes. The flat has proved so popular on social media that a queue of wannabe tenants is already forming. “I’ve had people messaging me to ask if they can move in after me because they love it so much!” she says.Decorating a rental property this thoroughly is rare. Most of us can’t be bothered to invest so much time and effort, preferring instead to inject our own personality by hanging pictures on ubiquitous magnolia walls. Jacobs is not, however, most people. A bit of a creative dynamo, she switched from a career in the city in her 40s and, despite being a single mum with two children, successfully launched her own design business in 2015 specialising in home textiles, lighting, art and wallpaper. Furniture store Heal’s snapped up her colourful cushions and table lamps, featuring bird and leaf motifs, within her first year of business and then gave her a pop-up concession at their Tottenham Court Road store in London, which ran for nine months in 2018.Not all of Jacobs’s application of colour theory went according to plan. She decided to paint her hallway pink to create a warm and welcoming entrance space, but her son Zach walked in and shouted: “You’re joking! I refuse to live in a house with a pink hall!” then stormed upstairs and slammed his door. She compromised by keeping just the woodwork pink – Floris by Mylands – which bounces off the now white walls.Zach reaped his revenge by requesting a green and purple palette in his bedroom. “I’m not a big fan of purple, it’s really hard to use,” says Jacobs. She offered him a pre-selected limited choice of 12 shades, from which he could choose three or four. “It turned out beautifully and is now almost my favourite room in the house,” she says.The rest of the interior was completed very much on a shoestring budget. Most furniture is borrowed, inherited from friends, or from eBay, skips and flea markets and then upcycled with a lick of paint or self-adhesive wallpaper. Even the sofabed in the lounge was discovered, abandoned, by her children, who dragged it up the hill and sat on it outside the front door, pleading to keep it.“It’s a horrid old 1980s grey chenille sofa, but it was free and huge. So, I bought some pink velvet Ikea curtains and threw them over it. When they get dirty I just shove them in the washing machine.” Pragmatic, resourceful and inspiring, Jacobs has an infectious positivity that is surely proof we all need to bring a bit of colour into our lives.Crystal Palace Artists’ Open House is 11am-6pm, 29 February – 1 March and 7-8 March (crystalpalaceart).

I feel very bad in fact. It is a strange cold. Not like usual. I know the kinds of cold I normally have, how my body reacts.“This is different. I am just as bad as I was. I often get better after three days. But with this there is no improvement. I haven’t got one bit better.”She said she had had a severely sore throat for more than five days, after first experiencing a runny nose and a cough.“Now I have this continual cold sweat, I have a temperature, though not all the time,” she said, telling of shivering every night for the past couple of days and feeling nauseous.“I have difficulty breathing and pain in my muscles, and fatigue. I do not pant, but I am finding it hard to breathe. And I am just very, very tired. I have a real tiredness, and a heavy head. I am too tired to do anything.“For a long time this has not felt like a normal cold. These symptoms have lasted almost a week. I know I need to get medicine to get better. This does not go magically.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she has consistently denied. She called her family on Saturday to update them on her health, the wider conditions in the prison ward and the reluctance of the prison to test her for the virus.Her husband Richard Ratcliffe had earlier raised concerns at Evin prison’s “refusal to test her” for the virus, which has spread rapidly in Iran.The Foreign Office (FCO) has called on the Iranian government to “immediately allow” health officials into the prison .The FCO said: “We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities on reports that coronavirus is spreading in Evin prison, including to British-Iranian dual nationals.“We call on the Iranian government to immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there.” So far 43 people in Iran have died from coronavirus – the most in any country besides China. Schools and universities have been closed and concerts and sports events cancelled.Iran confirmed 205 new cases of the coronavirus over the past day, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 593, The family of another imprisoned British-Iranian national, Anoosheh Ashoori, 65, warned this week of plans to transfer him to the prison’s ward 4, where at least three people are suspected to have the virus.The Iranian judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Ismaili, has responded to growing political pressure over the risk of contagion in prisons by putting prison staff on high alert for signs of the disease.He said he was activating a range of preventive measures including cutting the number of people being sent to jail and allowing some inmates out on temporary early release.Several high-ranking officials, including a vice-minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The rapid spread of the outbreak prompted the government to call on people to stay at home on Saturday.Iran is preparing for the possibility of testing tens of thousands of people for the coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the country rose again, according to an official quoted by the Associated Press.Tehran has dismissed a BBC Persian report that cited unnamed sources in the country’s health system who claimed at least 210 people in Iran had died in the outbreak – about five times as many as officially acknowledged.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in April 2016 while trying to depart Iran with her daughter. She was also accused spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic, charges she denies. United Nations officials have called for her release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214fea0779b4daecfce207fbd29bb82e9611afd5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8faa20e2a73866249769d7fa35e55789","title":"india modi and the rise of hindu nationalism","story":"With Delhi rocked by deadly protests as Muslim and Hindu groups clash violently,  writer Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism within India.

That makes sense given the complexity of many transactions. Worth noting, that is with skilled, trained, experienced labour.“So if we are dealing with 200m extra declarations, at a productivity rate of 4,000 per year that equals 50,000 staff needed on day one, and probably more.” Gove has access to about £7.5m to fund new HRMC customs agents but may seek funds from the wider Border Delivery Group cross-department initiative to prepare for 1 January 2021.Neighbouring countries including France, the Netherlands and Ireland launched customs officials recruitment drives last year, with six-month training schedules considered a minimum.Agents in Dover who deal with lorries coming in from the Ukraine, Turkey and other non-EU countries have warned that the skills base around customs disappeared with the creation of the single market in 1991, with just a handful of customs agents now operating in offices in Dover.The emergence of the human resource needed puts into perspective the scale of the task – the number of staff needed dwarfs the 12,000 people estimated to work in the fishing industry, a sector emblematic of Brexit.Government sources have said the new recruits would largely be “intermediaries”, agents who help businesses process their export and import paperwork with HMRC.The tax authorities will also recruit government agents to process the paperwork and guard against tariff evasion on borders.The Freight Transport Association and the RHA have been pressing the government for the past three years to wake up to the realities of a hard Brexit.The FTA said Thursday’s publication of the government’s negotiating goals gave some “hope” in that it provided confirmation that the government was not pursuing frictionless trade.However, it called for “more ambition” to help road, aviation and rail transport prepare to minimise the disruption from 1 January.“Over recent months, the FTA has repeatedly requested the UK government prioritise the needs of logistics in its negotiations around the future trading relationship with the EU or risk a devastating effect on the UK’s highly interconnected supply chain. The business organisation has also warned of knock-on effects on UK plc’s future productivity, and on the economy as a whole but these concerns seem to have been overlooked,” it said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbaf337001fb725e61a98dcc460bbc0a06c7139a/0_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eadf87eddf9a8f8efe649b607a63862c","title":"philip rutnam from unflappable civil servant to priti patel headache","story":"Becoming Home Office permanent secretary should have been the crowning point of Philip Rutnam’s career, but things soon became very uncivil indeedImagine the archetypal career civil-servant, and Philip Rutnam is it. Privately schooled and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Harvard University, the 54-year-old has always been considered unflappable and discreet. And when he was named in 2018’s new year honours list for his “public service”, Rutnam was on a roll. The previous year, he had been rewarded for three decades in the civil service with a move to the post of permanent secretary in the heavyweight Home Office, managing 35,000 staff as well as immigration and security at a time of Brexit and a heightened terror threat.Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service who appointed Rutnam to the post of permanent secretary at the Department of Transport in 2012, described him as “just the kind of person a minister needs in a department like the Home Office”.But in July 2019, the Home Office was to undergo a change of leadership. Out went Sajid Javid in came Priti Patel, after 18 months on the backbenches following her acrimonious ousting by Theresa May as international development secretary.There was a brief period of calm. It didn’t last long. Tensions steadily escalated and led, eventually, to Saturday’s explosive announcement by Rutnam. Not only was he resigning, he was suing the government for constructive dismissal. He had received allegations that Patel had sworn at, belittled and acted unreasonably to staff. It was behaviour, he said, “that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”. He added: “My experience has been extreme, but I consider there is evidence it was part of a wider pattern of behaviour.” These claims have been denied.Sources yesterday confirmed that Rutnam was far from the only person to have clashed with Patel, with many senior Home Office officials having had “run-ins” with her. A source close to the home secretary, however, argued that these officials had simply wanted to introduce a new work ethic and found that not everyone felt the same. The source, asking not to be named, admitted that their approach may have “pissed people off”.The first signs of trouble appeared within weeks of Patel’s arrival. Last August, one of Rutnam’s most senior colleagues, Mark Thomson, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration, announced that he was leaving. He told the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) that Patel was “coming in and doing things we weren’t comfortable with”. The Home Office claims that Thomson had decided to resign before Patel arrived, but has not provided evidence for this.By late October, Thomson had met with union officials and discussed a “breakdown” in relationships between Patel and senior civil servants. Tensions continued to rise. As the general election was announced, Patel wanted to appoint a new Home Office team, one that appreciated her hardline outlook on issues such as immigration. Members of her team now admit, with hindsight, that “perhaps we could have gone a bit slower”.As it was, Andy Tighe, who had been at the Home Office since 2011, and was communications director from 2017, felt he had become a target. The former BBC journalist, who was highly regarded by journalists in the parliamentary lobby, was considered by Patel’s team to have become “too hands-off”. Patel reportedly tried to sack Tighe on Christmas Eve. Rutnam was aghast, and though Tighe tried to hold on, he left in February.“There was nothing personal against Andy, though I think it was taken like that, which I understand,” said a Whitehall source.Others have said that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s closest aide, who has promised to reform the entire Whitehall machine – which he says acts as a break on radicalism – further emboldened Patel to take on Rutnam following the election.“In focus groups, they say it’s good that the civil service is working hard, and that is what Dom Cummings basically says,” said an advocate of Patel. Cummings is currently under pressure to give evidence under oath to an unfair dismissal employment tribunal involving the former Treasury aide Sonia Khan, who was sacked and marched out of Downing Street by an armed policeman.The new year brought little respite for Rutnam and his colleagues. In early February, another “heated” meeting with Patel and senior immigration officials over a deportation court case to Jamaica saw a high-ranking civil servant collapse after working overnight. The incident is said to have left officials in despair.Briefings against Patel became more pointed. One report suggested that MI5 did not trust the home secretary, though MI5 has disputed this. Patel’s supporters fought back, launching what Rutnam dubbed a “vicious and orchestrated” campaign against him.Any semblance of protocol has been abandoned. Usually such clashes are managed quietly behind the scenes until the civil servant is discreetly ushered into a new role. Sources pointed to the case of Helen Ghosh, who, as permanent secretary at the Home Office, reportedly clashed with May, the then home secretary. The situation was neatly resolved when Ghosh stepped down in November 2012 to become director general of the National Trust.The former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull, who was head of the civil service and cabinet secretary between 2002 and 2005, said he had never heard of a dispute involving a secretary of state and permanent secretary being allowed to intensify in a way that held such potentially serious consequences for the civil service.“Normally when there is an issue, a way would be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route to resolve the difficulty. For this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging,” said Turnbull.Rutnam, too, could have bided his time and held on for a new position. Or he could have resigned and gone quietly with financial compensation. It appears he had seen too much. His unprecedented salvo yesterday was clearly designed to topple Patel. For those Home Office civil servants left behind, some of whom yesterday praised Rutnam’s “courage and integrity”, the issue is not if a successor to Patel is announced – but when.

This created tension with the home secretary and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours.” He said he had been accused of briefing the press against Patel, a claim he said was completely untrue.“The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office,” he said. “I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to disassociate herself from the comments.”On Saturday night, Keir Starmer, the favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader, called on Patel to make a statement to parliament on Monday “to explain the allegations made about her own conduct”. He also demanded that the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, launch an immediate investigation into the reasons for Rutnam’s departure, adding: “Over recent weeks, there has been growing evidence of a serious breakdown of government. The prime minister’s handling of the flooding and coronavirus has been woeful, advisers in No 10 are out of control, and attacks on the civil service are growing.”Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA – the trade union for senior civil servants, which will back Rutnam’s legal case – said Rutnam had been offered the chance to “resign and go quietly with financial compensation” but had instead chosen to speak out against “attacks on civil servants”. It is expected that Rutnam will demand a public hearing at which he can outline his case against Patel.Penman added: “The Home Office now needs to find new leadership at a time when it needs stability. Those who engage in anonymous briefings need to bear the responsibility for this destructive behaviour.”Doubts over the home secretary’s ability to survive come less than three weeks after Sajid Javid’s resignation as chancellor, when he refused to bow to demands from Boris Johnson and the PM’s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, to sack all his advisers.It also emerged recently that a former adviser to Javid, Sonia Khan, is pursuing a case for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination after she was sacked by Cummings and marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer last September.Patel has already resigned once from the cabinet, when in 2017 she had to quit as international development secretary, having failed to be candid about unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, business executives and a senior lobbyist.Lord Kerslake, who was head of the civil service from the end of 2011 until September 2014, said he knew Rutnam well and had been involved in appointing him to his first post as permanent secretary at the Department for Transport in 2012.“For him to do this means he must have been driven to the limit and beyond,” Kerslake said. “To resign is serious enough, but then to take legal action is quite extraordinary. I think it will send bad signals through the civil service. It speaks of some very toxic relationships at the heart of government.”Kerslake said he would expect Patel to resign if Rutnam won his case for constructive dismissal.Lord Turnbull, a former cabinet secretary, said such personnel disputes were normally settled quietly behind the scenes. “When there is an issue, a way would normally be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route would be found to resolve the difficulty,” he said. “For this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging for the civil service.”When asked if Johnson retained full confidence in his home secretary, a Downing Street official said: “The prime minister has complete confidence in all of his cabinet.”Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the home affairs select committee, said Patel’s position was now in doubt “following this chaos”. He added: “This utterly extraordinary statement by a senior civil servant is clear evidence of just how dangerously dysfunctional relationships are becoming at the heart of this government – driven by a toxic culture at the very top.”The tensions between Patel and her permanent secretary surfaced last weekend. Reports suggested she had clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and was distrusted by intelligence chiefs. One report suggested Patel had tried to move Rutnam from her department after the rows.Labour’s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the row reflected “extremely badly on the government”.She said: “To end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government.“For the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6966a35958e751a9e28056e89c0d8c27bec28b/0_0_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d3aea43148d4c6a31f5eb157c0c33a","title":"rutnams refusal to go quietly leaves priti patel facing tough questions","story":"Pair clashed over Patel’s management of staff and Home Office’s workloadThere was never a question of whether Sir Philip Rutnam would leave the Home Office after briefings against him by government aides. The only question was how – and if one of Whitehall’s most senior civil servants would do so quietly.Rutnam’s explosive resignation statement, in which he effectively accused the home secretary of lying and of bullying staff, spectacularly killed off Cabinet Office hopes of a discreet resolution. It raised questions not just about Priti Patel’s behaviour but about Boris Johnson’s government and whether it can force through a legislation-heavy Brexit whilst confronting the civil service.Government aides believed on Thursday that they could smooth over the dispute and keep Rutnam onboard for at least a few weeks more. Discussions were still taking place between Rutnam’s union, the FDA, and the Cabinet Office late on Friday night. A payoff had been offered, which would have been overseen by the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill.But Rutnam’s resignation and vow to sue for constructive dismissal means Patel will be forced to defend her management style and say whether she had a role in the briefings against him.They had clashed not just over Patel’s management of staff and demanding nature but also over the workload being placed on the department. The Home Office is one of the busiest Brexit delivery departments in Whitehall, drawing plans for up a new immigration system and border inspection regime and managing the settlement scheme for 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK.It is also working on new rules on how to cooperate with the EU on security and crime-fighting, as well as bringing in new IT systems to manage all the projects. All of it must be up and running at the latest by the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, which Johnson has refused to extend.Insiders said Rutnam had put forward concerns about the workload. Patel’s aides briefed one newspaper that he was “Eeyore”, a reference to the ponderous, negative donkey from Winnie the Pooh.Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s key aide, will also face pressure to explain his role at the heart of this scandal. Questions will be asked about whether this could be considered the second resignation he has been involved in this month, following Sajid Javid’s decision to step down as chancellor.Cummings has made no secret of his plans to shake up Whitehall and has previously complained at how difficult it is to remove unwanted civil servants. As reports of tensions between Rutnam and Patel emerged 10 days ago, No 10 offered support for Patel but said nothing about Rutnam.One Whitehall source said: “Rutnam’s advisers may well want to know whether Cummings signed off a statement released by No 10 last week which backed Priti Patel as home secretary and the civil service as a whole but pointedly refused to offer support to Rutnam.”Once this statement was released, it was obvious to seasoned observers that Rutnam would leave.Rutnam’s statement made it clear he believed he had made efforts to reach out to Patel and had been met by a refusal to engage. Sources say Patel had refused to meet him for more than a week after the reports emerged that she was trying to force him out.In his statement, Rutnam said he expected several more days of briefings against him. Any such briefings may be a mistake. There is a distant possibility that Cummings, Patel and perhaps the prime minister could be asked to appear before an employment tribunal and explain their behaviour under oath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a62b56da0fe8a676faef4220d76d8dfe7ce282d/0_233_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce069c505e10061ca57ce169819cc164","title":"uk turning security into eu trade talks bargaining chip","story":"Boris Johnson has been accused of playing politics with the safety of Europeans after rejecting an EU proposal for future defence and foreign policy coordination.At No 10’s insistence, the issue has been left out of negotiations starting in Brussels on Monday on the post-Brexit relationship.EU sources accused the UK of trying to create leverage in the talks by rejecting Brussels’s suggestion in its negotiating mandate of an “ambitious, close and lasting cooperation on external action to protect citizens from external threats”.“On paper London’s vision of global Britain looks increasingly isolationist,” an EU diplomat added.The EU concern is that Johnson is attempting to put a “sword of Damocles” over the head of member states, particularly in the east of Europe where there are continued concerns about Russian aggression.Yan St-Pierre, a counter-terrorism expert, said the UK was “playing politics with Europe’s security”. With the US, it was “light years ahead” of the EU in electronic security capability – the online monitoring of terrorist activity, electronic surveillance, drone and satellite technology, he said.St-Pierre, head of the Berlin firm Modern Security Consulting, which advises EU governments, said: “The UK knows, especially when it comes to its electronic security capability, that it has a major bargaining chip.”The UK’s approach was effectively holding Europe hostage over its needs to protect itself. “The Germans, the French, a lot of other European countries, don’t have the capabilities that the UK has. It’s a very real bargaining chip compounded by the fact that US foreign policy is unreliable in the era of Trump,” said St-Pierre. “The EU countries are extremely dependent both on the UK and the US for electronic security and the sharing of electronic information.”The security of Europe, added St-Pierre, operated on a two-tier basis. The first was a formal, structured arrangement bound by official agreements and the second, a more informal arrangement built on human relationships and trusted sources.A government spokesman rejected the claims: “We expect foreign policy cooperation to be substantial but we don’t think we need a clunky institutional framework to deliver it. “We are already working closely with the EU on a wide range of issues including Iran, Libya and Russia absent such a framework, and see no reason why this cannot continue. We are open to discussing technical agreements where genuinely needed, such as a security of information agreement so we can share classified information, and are of course interested to hear the EU’s views.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2566709f9c4a924fa0b205927bec620eebe1e496/0_200_7042_4225/master/7042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c7aa3ed7ef09120aec41d39c37649f5","title":"treasury adviser farming and fisheries are not important","story":"Tim Leunig, who advises Rishi Sunak, has suggested ministers could look to be like SingaporeOne of the most senior government advisers has said the UK does not need its farming or fishing industries, according to reports.In comments seen by the Mail on Sunday, Dr Tim Leunig is understood to have said the food sector was “not critically important” to the country’s economy – and that agriculture and fisheries “certainly isn’t”.The economic adviser to the chancellor, in his leaked emails, is reported to have said that ministers could follow the example of Singapore, which is “rich without having its own agricultural sector”.Leunig’s opinions are likely to propel industry fears that ministers could discard safeguards for farmers and fishermen in the forthcoming post-Brexit trade talks with the US and the European Union.The government has, however, distanced itself from the comments made by the Treasury adviser. A spokesman said: “We have made clear the comments are not in line with government policy.”Sources told the PA news agency that the remarks were made in personal emails and that Dr Leunig was not speaking in his Treasury role.But rural and coastal communities voted out in large numbers during the 2016 referendum after the Vote Leave campaign argued that farmers and fishermen would would be better off once free of EU rules.Food standards have proved to be a crux issue as negotiators prepare for trade talks with their US counterparts in the coming weeks.Last week, the environment secretary, George Eustice, came in for criticism after he refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US as part of a trade agreement with Washington.Allowing such treated and often cheaper foods into the UK could undermine British farmers who operate to higher standards.Fishermen also fear promises made to them on increased catch quotas and controlling who fishes in British waters could be traded in exchange for market access during the talks with the EU, which are due to begin next week.Brussels has made clear it wants little to change in terms of access for European boats and quota allocation once the transition period is over in December.Leunig’s comments would not be the first time a government figure has managed to upset UK industry.Boris Johnson is said to have made controversial comments on the topic of Brexit, having reportedly said “fuck business” when questioned about the sector’s concerns over a no-deal exit from the EU in 2018.Treasury adviser and academic Dr Leunig is said to be close to Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser in Downing Street.Cummings has called for “weirdos and misfits” to join the civil service in an effort to break the mould of current Whitehall thinking.Whitehall saw a huge rupture at the head of the Home Office on Saturday when Sir Philip Rutnam, the department’s most senior civil servant, quit and launched a tirade against the home secretary.Sir Philip accused Priti Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department.He told the BBC he planned to sue for constructive dismissal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

The lead had changed hands throughout, especially in a second half that featured turn after turn. Exeter faced one passage of play, well after time and down to 13 men, but the final deed – a penalty try at the umpteenth chaotic scrum – settled the game in the home team’s favour five minutes after the clock had turned red.“It was one of our more important wins,” said Harlequins director of rugby Paul Gustard. “I was really impressed with the character of the team to keep going for the win when they could have settled for the draw.”Repeatedly, Quins opted to scrum penalties, several after normal time with a three-point deficit and the posts beckoning. It was an all-out assault, which came off with that climactic penalty try. The bonus-point win takes Quins into the top six, from ninth, but Exeter remain clear at the top. Curiously, it was at the scrum they were found out, even as they ran in three fine tries with an aplomb more associated with Harlequins.It looked as if they would do no more than pick up where they left off the weekend before, when they had put 50 past fellow play-off contenders Northampton. With pretty much their first stretch of possession, Phil Dollman dummied and broke inside Marcus Smith for a fine inidual try in the third minute.The home side rode that indignity and started to flex their muscles. To begin with, the Quins scrum could do no wrong. Having won an early penalty, they won another within range, which Smith landed. Joe Simmonds replied almost immediately with a penalty before Harlequins levelled, again the points stemming from another scrum. They were scrumming penalties as early as the 20th minute, but at the site of the latest scrum penalty Danny Care, in his 200th Premiership appearance, tapped and fed the formidable Paul Lasike.There is not much arguing with the American on the charge and his path to the line was unbroken. Very direct, very Exeter.A penalty apiece, albeit with Exeter’s scrum starting to win favour for no obvious reason, maintained parity at the break. Neither Exeter’s ascendancy at the scrum nor the parity was to last long. Quins repeated the scrum-Care-Lasike routine to set up Tevita Cavubati from close range.Cue the Simmonds brothers. Sam cut inside Lasike like the centre he might have been in another life for a dazzling break, which was improved when brother Joe ghosted past four more tacklers to the line to draw Exeter level. Three minutes later, and Sam broke again, Elvis Taione charged deep into Quins territory, before Joe ghosted through again, past three this time, for Exeter’s third.Quins levelled on the hour. Another scrum (instead of a simple shot at goal), and Alex Dombrandt fed Care who sent Smith on an arc round the Exeter midfield. Nick Auterac was shown the first of three late yellow cards, when he deliberately knocked-on after Joe Simmonds had split Quins’ defence once more. The latter landed the penalty that put Exeter ahead with quarter of an hour to go.The drama was only just beginning. Ollie Devoto’s high tackle on Smith meant he was next to go to the bin, with six minutes to go. Quins continued to take scrums for each penalty. With a minute to go, the referee apologised for awarding one too quickly when Care cross-kicked to an unmarked Gabriel Ibitoye with what should have been the advantage. From then on, any benefit of the doubt would go to the home side.Alec Hepburn’s yellow card at the umpteenth scrum penalty reduced Exeter to 13 briefly, but there would be time for Devoto to return before the game was finally settled. The scrum splintered into chaos, and the referee marched to the sticks. An unsatisfactory way to win, perhaps, but appropriately dramatic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f7e633dc4d46754b0aa008cb05042ce39852f1f/0_170_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e88a0fd17b93bcb527a985f91a9c2b","title":"wales time adapt new coach alun wyn jones","story":"The defending champions never lost three successive Six Nations matches under Warren Gatland but, with Twickenham next, it could happen in Wayne Pivac’s first campaignThe Six Nations launch is an occasion when hope tends to outscrummage expectation but Alun Wyn Jones was one at this year’s event who did not allow himself to be transported by fancy. The 12-year reign of Warren Gatland, when a success-starved nation was transported back to the 1970s, had ended 10 weeks before and his successor, Wayne Pivac, was coming to terms with replacing a legend.“There has been a lot of change and, to a point, we have to cut ties with the past,” said the Wales captain back then. “If you continue to look over your shoulder, you will slow yourself down. If you are going to evolve, you have to adapt. It is going to be a bumpy road and we cannot shy away from that.”Three rounds in, Wales have been bumped off as champions despite a five-try victory over Italy in the opening round. This was followed by a mistake-soaked display in Dublin as Storm Ciara started to blow in, although they showed the characteristics honed by Gatland of hanging on in a game when they were a distant second, and then a first home defeat by France in 10 years, after which Pivac resisted the very great temptation to blame three instances of the officials failing to apply the rules as a factor in the result.“The performances have been pleasing in patches but there is no consolation in a certain amount,” says Jones now. “It is only pleasing when you win. We made a decent start but our errors against Ireland compounded themselves and we created opportunities against France but did not take enough of them. Test rugby is about winning and we have not done that.”Wales never lost three successive championship matches under Gatland, who marked his first campaign in charge in 2008 with a grand slam, but that fate is on the cards on Saturday when they travel to Twickenham, the ground where they have enjoyed the least success in the Six Nations, their two victories coming in that slam season and in 2012.“I have played there a few times and we know what is coming,” says Jones. “It is always a big week. England are building after a disappointing start and they are putting the pieces together to be the complete team they showed they were in the World Cup. They are pretty rudimentary, in the way they impose themselves rather than the way they play.“It is uncharted territory for us after two defeats but I do not think you can compare this season with the 12 Warren had. The level is here and now and I do not think it is about looking at the two coaches. Warren established himself over a long period of time and everyone became used to what he was about and what he did. It is unfair to compare an experienced writer with one who is new to the job,” he says, turning it back on his questioners.Pivac, who spent five years with the Scarlets, was appointed with a brief to evolve Wales’s attacking game. There has been a distinct change in emphasis with kicking more strategic than a means of setting up the defence and inviting a catcher to break it down and players such as Nick Tompkins have been used to attack shoulders rather than take contact, but understanding takes time, with pressure in the Six Nations unrelenting and the new coach started at a time when a number of his first-choice backs and a couple of forwards were unavailable.“We can be reactionary and throw the baby out with the bathwater or we can step back and reflect that there is change,” says Jones. “I said from the outset that the fact we were changing was no excuse, but we are adapting. People asked for that in the past and it is about getting more out of our performances and turning them into results rather than stepping back and pointing fingers. That way you can come out on the other side.”Pivac and his management team are contracted until the next World Cup but they all have break clauses in 2021, one reason why Shaun Edwards declined to extend his 12 years with the Welsh Rugby Union and instead move to France where his deal runs to the end of 2023. The WRU could not afford to lumber itself financially but it accepted there would be a period of transition.While Gatland won the Six Nations at the first attempt, his next three years in the tournament were unexceptional, with eight victories and seven defeats. It changed in 2011 when he blooded a number of young players and made Sam Warburton captain. Wales made the World Cup semi-finals that year and won the championship in 2012 and 2013.Time, Jones argues, is what Pivac needs. “We are trying to play with our heads up and develop the style Wayne wants, which is anything but robotic,” he says. “Change is the most difficult thing whatever line of work you are in. We have to stay strong and not be shackled by fear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e35d17e8e5609cd4ede9a50571485143faefec5/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=11f0fd5883d9c266cea82d9d2dc614cd","title":"hand sanitiser or hand washing which more effective against coronavirus covid 19","story":"Supermarkets are running out of hand sanitiser as people rush to protect themselves from Covid-19. But does it beat using soap and water?As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitiser gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals.Sanitisers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs?Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not).This means that making your own sanitiser, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. “It’s very unwise, dangerous, even,” she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky – so it is a big no-no.The key thing is when to use hand sanitiser. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food.Bloomfield’s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water – or, if that is not possible, use hand gel – when you return to your “safe place”, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don’t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch – such as door handles and bus poles – and if you can’t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face.A virus needs a host – living cells – to reproduce: so don’t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them.The best option is soap and water. According to a 2019 study by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in.Soap has mild antibacterial properties, but it does not kill viruses. It does remove dirt, though, so wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other. Rinse them thoroughly under running water for 20 seconds (or as the NHS puts it, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday). Rinsing thoroughly is key to washing away any viruses. Dry your hands well with a disposable towel, then use that towel to turn off the tap before throwing it away.It might seem counterintuitive, but a study published in the medical journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012 concluded that, from a hygiene standpoint: “Paper towels are superior to air dryers.” This is because the towels dry your hands more quickly and more thoroughly than dryers do, and contamination happens more through wet hands than dry.Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, says that stocks of hand sanitiser running low is a problem, but cautions against panic-buying. First, you don’t need to use very much – a little bottle will go a long way. In fact, a spokesman for the chemical products company Kao Corporation reportedly said last week that too much hand gel can cause irritation and skin sensitivity, by drying out the skin and removing natural oils. Damaged skin increases vulnerability to infection, so hand sanitisers, like most things, are best used in moderation – and only when handwashing is not an option.As Bloomfield puts it, it is not about being paranoid. She likens the process to vaccinations or wearing seatbelts: it is about being disciplined. While some companies have reportedly banned handshaking and other physical contact in an effort to avoid Covid-19, that is not official guidance.It is impossible not to engage with the world, so you just need to be cautious and methodical in your hand hygiene. “If everyone complies with good hygiene,” says Bloomfield, “then you’re making sure as far as possible that you’re not picking it up, and in the unlikely event you are infected you’re not spreading it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965f1a83746f3fabd33b5ef5d23fa427cb02271a/19_0_3269_1961/master/3269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be652141e7cdfe253f322d813ce3cc9a","title":"nato turkey syria airstrikes russia un jens stoltenberg","story":"Military alliance could strengthen reconnaissance missions to limit threat from Russian planesNato allies will consider strengthening Ankara’s air defences in response to the strike that killed 33 Turkish troops in rebel-held Syria, following an emergency meeting of the military alliance in Brussels on Friday.Turkey had also called for western countries to establish a no-fly zone after the incident but Nato sources stressed that idea – which could lead to direct conflict with the Russian air force – was not seriously discussed.Jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s secretary general, said that members of Nato expressed their “full solidarity” with Turkey in the aftermath of the attack, which took place in Idlib, the last part of Syria outside Bashar al-Assad’s de facto control.But Stoltenberg offered no immediate promise of assistance to Ankara, saying instead in the aftermath of the meeting that Nato members were “constantly looking into what more they can do to provide further support for Turkey”.Sources said this would most likely mean strengthening Nato’s existing reconnaissance mission over the country and building on the Patriot air defence system run by Spain. The US has previously said it would only supply similar equipment directly if Turkey ditches plans to deploy a rival Russian S-400 system.The urgent talks on the crisis were held on Friday after Turkey requested a rare emergency meeting of members under article 4 of the alliance’s governing treaty, on the grounds that its security was under threat.Turkish officials blamed the Syrian regime for the major attack on its troops, which were deployed earlier this month to bolster rebel groups Ankara supports against the regime campaign.However, several sources in Idlib and unverified footage of the night-time strike suggested it had been carried out by the Russian air force, which has helped Damascus conduct a ferocious three-month offensive on the province.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey had retaliated by hitting Damascus regime targets “from the air and ground”. Drone footage released by the Turkish military of the response showed blistering attacks on tanks, howitzers and soldiers.The retaliatory attacks destroyed five Syrian military helicopters and two air defence systems, and “neutralised” 309 Syrian regime soldiers, said defence minister Hulusi Akar, without providing evidence. A war monitor said at least 20 Syrian troops had died in the counterattacks.One Turkish soldier was killed and another wounded in a fresh artillery fire by the Syrian regime on Friday.Adding to the volatile situation, Moscow sent two warships, the Admiral Makarov and Admiral Grigorovich, both capable of firing Kalibr cruise missiles, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean waters off Syria on Friday. They moved through the Bosphorus strait, which is governed by an international treaty, sailing through the heart of Istanbul.Almost a million people have been displaced and driven north to the Turkish border by the regime campaign on rebels and jihadist factions, making the battle for control of Syria’s last opposition stronghold the worst humanitarian crisis in the war to date.Thursday’s deadly bombardment has added to weeks of growing tensions between Turkey, a supporter of some Syrian rebel groups and a Nato member, and Moscow, which is allied with Assad.The UN security council held emergency talks on the escalation of fighting on Friday, requested by the US, Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, Estonia, and the Dominican Republic - some of which have stated publicly that they support Turkey.Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the council Moscow is “ready to de-escalate with anyone” in the battleground Idlib region and reiterated that Moscow “had not participated in the attacks.”In a telephone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Erdoğan said Syrian government troops and allied forces remained legitimate targets for Ankara. The Kremlin said it agreed on the need for a new arrangement to avert clashes in Idlib. Turkey said the leaders agreed to meet as soon as possible.Turkey said Erdoğan had also discussed the crisis with the US president, Donald Trump, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, earlier on Friday. The chancellor’s spokesperson said she “condemned the ruthless attacks on Turkish troops”.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo described Thursday’s attack as “despicable and brazen” and said the US was “reviewing options to assist Turkey against this aggression as we seek to prevent further Assad regime and Russian brutality and alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Idlib”.There was no immediate confirmation from Damascus of the reported troop deaths or any comment on the flare-up with Ankara.The UN said the latest fighting in Idlib was coming “dangerously close” to encampments of the displaced, risking an imminent “bloodbath”. Turkey, which is already home to millions of Syrian refugees, fears more people will attempt to cross its closed southern border. Thursday’s attack brought to 53 the number of Turkish security personnel killed in Idlib this month. Elsewhere on Thursday, jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels re-entered Saraqeb, a key crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government’s devastating offensive.The counter-offensive could be short-lived, however, as Syrian troops backed by Russian airpower continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/511a3cf847b9d8f2e11a19e6c5fc4cdeb7d67218/104_755_6208_3725/master/6208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c7a667e698a9bc2248f4532f47793","title":"italy and france ban public gatherings as coronavirus cases spread","story":"The US recorded its first death from coronavirus yesterday, when a man in his 50s died in a care home. A further 21 residents were confirmed to be suffering from the virus, with four of them said to be very ill.The outbreak at the home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland led to the vice president, Mike Pence, announcing a ban on travel to Iran and stronger warnings on travel to Italy and South Korea.The US president, Donald Trump, said that there were likely to be more cases and he would consider additional restrictions, including closing the US border with Mexico in response to the virus’s spread.The victim was said to be of a high medical risk and there was no evidence he had travelled abroad or had links to anyone who had. Washington state health officials said other residents and some staff were also showing “some sort of symptoms” but had not yet been diagnosed.About 60 cases have been confirmed in the US. Trump said healthy Americans should recover if they contract the virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets. “We’ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus,” he said. “Our country is prepared for any circumstance. There is no reason to panic at all.”Elsewhere, Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador and Luxembourg. Mexico reported two more cases, bringing the country’s total to four, and Brazil announced its second.France and Italy imposed strict bans on public gatherings as numbers of coronavirus cases rose dramatically in both countries.One of the first casualties of the ban was Sunday’s Paris half-marathon, which has been cancelled, while a major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors has been put back from March to June.In Italy, five key football matches were postponed this weekend. The games include the crunch top-of-the-table Serie A clash between Inter Milan and Juventus. The matches had been scheduled to take place behind closed doors after the Italian government banned public gatherings as part of its campaign to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. But now Serie-A officials have decided the matches will be played on 13 May – when fans will be able to attend.Nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus in Italy, and authorities in northern regions – where Europe’s worst outbreak is centred – on Saturday ordered that schools and universities should stay closed for a second week, dashing any hopes of a swift return to normality.In France, authorities on Saturday reported 16 new cases of the virus. “All public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned,” health minister Olivier Véran announced.He also advised people to cut back on la bise – the custom of greeting friends and relatives with kisses. As of Saturday, France had registered 73 virus cases, up from 57 on Friday and of these, 59 people remained in hospital, two had died and 12 had recovered, Véran added.More than 50 countries have now reported cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the outbreak to “very high” – its top level of risk assessment.Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases, and there have been 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries, although the WHO said on Friday that there was still a chance of containing it if its chain of transmission were broken.South Korea has also reported a “critical moment” in its battle against transmission, after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day, while the Japanese island of Hokkaido announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures to slow the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1d34a3b3cf7e14e248b3e711ea1d39a2c57c7f/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1987f1992e263cd52ba1008e653c7f","title":"its the last nail in the coffin venice empties as coronavirus spreads","story":"Outbreak triggers new crisis as city struggles to recover from November’s severe floodsIn St Mark’s Square last week, tables and chairs outside the famed Caffè Florian remained empty, with the few tourists spoiled for space as they posed for selfies. More white medical masks than carnival masks could be seen. Rows of empty gondolas seemed to rock impatiently.After Venice cancelled most of its annual celebrations amid Italy’s attempts to contain Europe’s worst coronavirus outbreak, most visitors ran for the hills, leaving the lagoon city a virtual ghost town.The Venetian tourism industry is still reeling after severe flooding in November left much of the city under water now it has a very different kind of crisis to face. More than 800 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Italy, and 29 people have died.“We were waiting for the carnival to get the economy going again after the acqua alta, but now we have a new problem,” said Sabrina, a worker at fashion store Sartoria dei Dogi.“It’s completely dead: no one comes past, the streets are empty, and people are afraid,” said Paola Bertoldo, who sells her own Murano glass jewellery from a shop in the Santa Croce district. “I don’t know how we can manage this time. This is the last nail in the coffin.”The entire economy has been affected, said Simone Venturini, city councillor for economic development. The real damage would be long-term, he said, with few bookings for the usually busy periods of Easter and the Biennale arts festival starting in May. “In a few weeks, we believe the virus will be a distant memory like Sars, but we need to get the message out that it’s business as normal.”Venice, which receives 20-30 million holidaymakers a year, has a love-hate relationship with tourists. Overcrowding causes antagonism between those Venetians who make a living from tourism and those who feel suffocated. Some residents were finding the reduction in tourism liberating, said Jane Da Mosto, founder of the thinktank We Are Here Venice.“Of course it’s terrible that livelihoods are being affected, but now people can breathe,” she said. “It’s like being on a crammed subway and then being able to read your book and stretch.”As far as Da Mosto is concerned, the tourism timeout ought to be an opportunity to rethink and implement viral systemic changes, but it is unlikely to happen in a city where the needs of Venetians are ignored in favour of the tourism industry. “If this is a wake-up call,” she asked, “who is listening?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4278ce158beb47c02d7c212c243245fd6deb77/0_31_4638_2784/master/4638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f42613411efb4735eb89a6be74a6e1e","title":"muhyiddin yassin named as malaysian prime minister","story":"Appointment follows week of turmoil after collapse of Mahathir Mohamad governmentMalaysia’s 94-year-old former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has lost a power struggle with an ex-interior minister in a shock twist that will return a scandal-plagued party to power.Muhyiddin Yassin will be sworn as PM in on Sunday, royal officials said, after a week of turmoil that followed the collapse of a reformist government and Mahathir’s resignation as premier.“The process to appoint the prime minister cannot be delayed because the country needs a government for the wellbeing of the people and the nation,” a palace statement said. The king appoints the premier, and rival candidates had this week been seeking to show they commanded majority support from MPsAs well as ending the premiership of Mahathir, who was the world’s oldest leader, the developments mean there will be little hope of his designated successor, Anwar Ibrahim, becoming prime minister.Muhyiddin’s coalition is dominated by the multi-ethnic country’s Muslim majority and includes the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the scandal-plagued party of the disgraced former leader Najib Razak.Umno was the lynchpin of a long-ruling coalition that was toppled from power in elections in 2018 amid allegations that Najib and his cronies had looted the state fund 1MDB.Muhyiddin, a former Mahathir ally, joined forces with Umno in an attempt to win power. His coalition also includes a hardline Muslim party that is pushing for Islamic laws.The crisis began when Mahathir and Anwar’s ruling Pact of Hope alliance, which stormed to victory two years ago against Najib’s government, collapsed a week ago.A group of ruling coalition lawmakers had joined forces with opposition parties in an attempt to form a new government without Anwar and stop him becoming premier.After that effort failed, Mahathir and Anwar launched rival bids to win power, reviving a rivalry that has shaped politics in the country for more than two decades.But as Muhyiddin’s bid quickly gained support and it became clear he could get into power with Umno, Mahathir and Anwar did a volte-face and joined forces again on Saturday.The remaining parties from the Pact of Hope alliance threw their support behind Mahathir to become premier, and there had been hopes he could stop Muhyiddin.The Pact of Hope, a band of opposition groups that included a party dominated by the country’s ethnic Chinese minority, Anwar’s People’s Justice party and Mahathir’s Malay-dominated outfit, was uneasy from the start.Mahathir had pledged to eventually hand the premiership to Anwar, but many were sceptical he wanted to give power to his old rival, and rival factions were seeking to push Anwar out.Muhyiddin, 72, was a member of Umno for many decades and held a string of senior posts. He was deputy prime minister in Najib’s government, but Najib sacked him after he voiced criticism of the 1MDB scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e62156f29f032ccad82e0dc8dc3e2c52e64a9ba/224_499_2435_1460/master/2435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e917feca63cae8bc0293fcb7f871e32","title":"rebecca solnit younger feminists shift understanding give new tools","story":"It’s a myth that wisdom comes only with age, the writer argues. Young women and girls offer new tools to useAs you grow older you become an immigrant from a vanished country, a country some of your peers may remember but the young may find unimaginable or incomprehensible. You could call it the land of before before some great change, before we did things this way, before we decided that was unacceptable, before we shed new light on an old problem. I was shaped by a world that no longer quite exists, so I can’t imagine myself at, say, 18 in the present moment, because to do so is to imagine someone utterly different. She does not exist, and I – as we all do – exist as the cumulative effect of my experiences, opportunities or lack thereof, and ideals.So much of what shaped and scarred my younger self, and made me a solitary feminist, and then much later one among many, was the unspeakability of violence against women and all the denigration, harassment and silencing that went with it. It was epidemic, and yet every incident was supposed to be an isolated incident, and nobody was supposed to connect the crimes to the culture that relished violence against women as entertainment, and denied it existed in any significant way as fact, and made sure that prevention and prosecution were as feeble as they were rare. All those forces still exist, but something else does alongside them: a vigorous conversation, speaking and naming and describing and defining rejecting the excuses and cover-ups and justifications.That conversation is exhilarating for me. It’s also a conundrum in that I have spent much of the past dozen years reading horrific stories of rape, torture, murder, stalking and domestic violence in the news, and hearing them directly from survivors. I have been both exhilarated to see change come – although not enough – and exhausted by this immersion in (mostly) male violence and (mostly) female annihilation. But we have at least diagnosed the problem.There is no 18-year-old me, but there are plenty of 18 year olds to show me how much has changed, and to promise through their beautiful insubordination and high expectations that more is going to change. Last year, when a young woman I know shared an essay she wrote about accompanying her friend through the all-night ordeal of getting a rape kit from a hospital, I was amazed to see how truths and stances that were so hard-won for many of us were built into her worldview. She had this new equipment, and seemed never to have had the self-doubt that undermines people’s ability to recognise what just happened that old voice saying “you’re overreacting”, which is another way to say “you’re having the wrong feelings”, which really means “your feelings are inconvenient for others, so strangle them at birth”.Decades ago, I came across an aphorism that said, more or less: “Remember the respect due to youth.” One of the pernicious myths of our time is that wisdom accumulates with age in some steady, standard way, like tree rings. In this scheme, the old have it and the young lack it, and should open their little beaks and wait for a worm of wisdom to be dropped in. Told this way, wisdom is also the result of inidual development, rather than of how we as a society become better at seeing something, smarter about knowing how something works. I think that conversations about generational ides miss the point, and are all too common in the attempt to set up feminism as a generational catfight – because people like it when ladies fight. This culture doesn’t know how to tell stories that don’t pit groups against each other in some warlike drama of scarcity and selfishness.Me, I admire and am grateful to the younger feminists at work, and learn a lot from them – not any one big truth but a host of insights that have gradually shifted my understanding, and given me new tools to use. What I find in so many young women and girls – right down to toddlers in my family, as well as that young woman taking her friend to get the rape kit – is a clarity and confidence about their rights, needs, and truths that feels new and different. We can credit an older generation with sowing some of the seeds, but they are the beautiful harvest. They are the victory.For this collective awakening, the young often lead by being more demanding, less willing to settle, less willing to believe that something is impossible – though almost six decades on this earth have taught me that those things the status quo says are impossible do come to pass, from time to time. I remember that, 20 years ago, leaving the age of fossil fuel behind seemed impossible because solar and wind were as expensive as they were inadequate. And I remember 1992, when a total of six women in the US Senate (including the first woman senator of colour) saw it hailed as The Year of the Women, since that was more than there had ever been before. There are currently 25 women senators.Feminism is part of an immense endeavour on all seven continents (and sometimes a space station or two) to change how we imagine gender, rights, equality, consent, voice to create a conversation that invites participation for those who have felt excluded, silenced. It’s a conversation about race, gender, sexual orientation, trans rights, disability rights, religious freedom, neuroersity, and so much more, and about how these things can intersect in a single person or interaction. Anyone in this conversation learns from others to look harder, see farther, ask new questions, use new terms that admit new possibilities. It is as though we’re wandering through the night, each with our small light, sometimes all shining our beams on the same problem until we see it clearly, passing descriptions from one to another, building trail maps together, sharpening the focus, until we reach somewhere new. Or become something new.There have been some very literal choral moments, as when huge numbers of feminists use the same hashtag: for example, in 2014, a young Muslim woman launched #yesallwomen in response to the dismal male response to the Isla Vista massacre, when a 22-year-old incel killed six people near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. She was responding to the widely used hashtag #notallmen, which shifted the focus to exonerating men rather than recognising how immense the threat of violence is for, yes, all women.But it’s more often been a conversation than a chorus. Just the very simple line “rapists cause rape” – maybe coined by the website Feministing in 2010, or maybe they got it from someone else – gave us a tool and perspective to push back on all the victim-blaming all the emphasis on what she was wearing and drinking, and what else she did wrong by not being locked inside a bank vault clad in a nun’s habit, while holding a revolver.So I admire the young, and that seems worth saying when boomers complaining about millennials is a thing, and when some older women are so inured to the task of surviving patriarchy that they can’t break out of the “not that badtoughen up” framework to acknowledge that, yes, this shit sucks, and it does have an effect on us, and it’s wrong. And it’s not just me, who was born when John F Kennedy was president. Mary Beard, who was born when Winston Churchill was doing his last round as prime minister, recently wrote about that lost continent of silence, saying: “One of the reasons that my students in the 2010s get anxious about reading Ovid’s Metamorphoses or the early books of Livy is that they have a much sharper idea of what those works are about. Fifty years ago, we usually did not recognise (nor were we taught to) that the Metamorphoses was a poem founded on rape. Back then, we saw it as a series of ‘ravishings’ (with an awkward hint of pleasure implied) and the transformation of the victims into trees, or whatever, was treated as just one more curious aspect of ancient mythology.”She’s defending millennials against charges of fragility – and I’m with her in her enthusiasm for the more acute perceptions of this generation. In a superb 2018 New Yorker piece, millennial feminist Jia Tolentino revisits Ovid in the wake of the 2018 hearing for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, because she feels “a shameful, increasing desire to stop running, to find some way to be impassive and serene”, like those women turned into lakes and trees. If younger readers like Tolentino and Beard’s students recognise that Metamorphoses is full of rape, then it is because of groundwork laid by older readers, writers and dissidents. Whether or not we stand on the shoulders of giants, we stroll on the topsoil into which the past has decomposed, and some seeds planted then are sprouting, and even blooming, now.There was so much we couldn’t talk about then, and still some aspects and consequences we haven’t yet talked about enough. Recently I wrote a book about those things, Recollections Of My Non-Existence, about the muteness of my formative years. Because nothing I could say seemed to mean “no” in any effectual way to the men who harassed and menaced me, nothing I could do made them desist, and speaking up seemed likely to make things worse. What I wanted, for starters, was someone to shout, with me, that this was absolutely wrong. I wanted someone to ask questions with me about how we change it all, and why we must.I had experiences that are still common. Last summer, my friend’s teenage daughter had a man threaten to kill her when she responded defiantly to his harassment – the kind of thing that happened to me, over and over, in my youth. It’s so ordinary, and there’s so much of it. The past several years have been an extraordinary collaborative exhumation and reinvention of women’s experience, and one in which the old have learned from the young at least as much as the opposite.I still think the conversation is far from complete. But I’m glad it’s begun. When people suggest feminism has somehow been a failure, I like to hark back to the world I was born into, the world that made my mother so full of suppressed fury, the world in which women were, by law and custom, so much more deeply unequal. Marriage laws in the US, the UK, and many other countries defined wives as property of a sort, or chattel, or pets, whose bodies husbands had the right to rape and beat, and whose choices husbands controlled, from financial to medical decisions. Women were excluded from nearly all positions of economic, legal, social, educational and governmental power, and the language to even describe phenomena such as workplace sexual harassment as something serious and illicit did not exist. I could go on, but I’ll stop, after referencing how routine was the denigration of women as subjective, unreliable, incompetent creatures, undermining the foundation to participate and even to object. Not that that bit is over, but at least we’ve been pointing it out for half a century.Even to see some of these forms of oppression was a great collective project. In one of the books I can’t call seminal – is there a feminine equivalent? ovarian? – but that was formative, Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique (1963), she talks about “the problem that has no name”. We have named it bit by bit: with old words like patriarchy and gaslighting put back to work with new words like marginalisation, mansplaining (not coined by me, by the way), Kate Manne’s himpathy, Kimberlé Crenshaw’s intersectionality, rape culture, misogynoir, victim-blaming and slut-shaming.What has been beautiful and amazing about the past several years has been the great collective research expedition to examine our lives, to turn up the volume on historically silenced voices, and turn down the volume a little on the people who always got heard. We have made a new map of who we have been, and are, and could be. To be one voice in this global conversation has been a joy and an honour to hear others has been an education and an inspiration. And the one thing I am surest of is that we are only beginning.• Recollections Of My Non-Existence by Rebecca Solnit is published by Granta Books at £16.99.

He is awaiting sentence and is reportedly discussing an appeal.The London lawyer for British women bringing claims against the producer was worried that until Weinstein was convicted his team might have been tempted to leak the identities of the British women in a move to destabilise them and deter them from pursuing their cases.Unlike in the UK, there is no automatic anonymity for victims of sexual assault in the US. Jill Greenfield, a partner at law firm Fieldfisher, said her move had been made in order to protect victims from undue pressure. “We have made sure that key parties involved cannot disclose details of my clients. You’ve also got to think about the person who’s had the allegations made against them and who might want to put victims’ details in the press.“When you have someone so powerful in any walk of life, they may want to put those details out there”, she said.Greenfield, who lodged the first civil claim at London’s high court against Weinstein for alleged rape and sexual assault days after the allegations against the producer emerged in October 2017, said: “They are entitled to automatic anonymity here but the defendant lives abroad, and the concern is that they are not entitled to automatic anonymity in the US.”However, Weinstein’s guilty verdict is believed to have convinced at least one of his alleged British victims to speak publicly about her experience for the first time.Evidence exists that Weinsten and his team have previously attempted to target his alleged victims. In 2017, it emerged that he had tried to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.Weinstein hired private security agencies to collect information on the women as part of a strategy to prevent accusers from going public with sexual assault claims against him.Most of the women Greenfield is representing are understood not to be high-profile like some of those involved in the New York trial, which featured actresses such as Annabella Sciorra. However, Greenfield added that fears of her clients’ identities being exposed escalated when they had liaised with the New York police department, making it difficult for UK victims to feel safe giving background information for the trial.“One of the real problems my clients had was they realised that stepping into a court in New York meant the flashbulbs would be going everything would be reported. Suddenly their lives would be an open book.”As well as the six cases, which list Weinstein companies in the UK and US as defendants, the politan Police is currently investigating 16 allegations against Weinstein of sexual assault. from 11 women.Analysis of Operation Kaguyak, the investigation into allegations involving Weinstein, reveal that the oldest claims date to the 1980s and concern an alleged attack in west London. One woman says she was sexually assualted three separate times, in Westminster in 2010 and 2011, and Camden in 2015. Seven of the alleged attacks took place in the policing area of Westminster, which covers the West End.Weinstein is facing up to 29 years in prison and is due to be sentenced on 11 March. The New York trial heard weeks of harrowing testimony from six women who claimed that Weinstein had attacked them.They included an actress who said that he injected something into his genitals to get an erection and raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.Sciorra, best known for her work in The Sopranos, told the court that she was raped by Weinstein at her home almost 30 years ago. “My testimony was painful but necessary,” she said. Weinstein now faces an additional rape and sexual assault prosecution in Los Angeles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3afdf51d3f7544170c02734cb302eaa5c10cd343/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdebb004ec1875ca34ec4d9ea48515ac","title":"what is coronavirus what should i do symptoms","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ece6fc47153d85f36c43238bdd1511b6f3c3887a/0_0_3940_2365/master/3940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b837e88c97f6f018657fd0230724412","title":"worse than flu busting coronavirus myths","story":"The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c182c55d1854e6002f6aeec27921f2dc935ca6/67_402_4793_2878/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf00ebab0d785815a0ff400ee89c316","title":"coronavirus spreads across the world in pictures","story":"As cases of people infected with the coronavirus or Covid-19 grow rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the rest of the world is bracing for a pandemic"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178619.1582129804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bogged down bleak outlook for the west s blanket peatlands","story":"Looking out at blackface ewes caught in the squalls, tails to the wind, hailstones sequinned on their fleeces, it has been hard to grudge them their share of the western landscape. How fair would it be to call the high, bare slopes of the hills “sheepwrecked”?This was a coinage from George Monbiot, radical columnist on ecological issues for the  newspaper. It headed a chapter in Feral, his book that urged “rewilding” of the upland ecosystems.Monbiot lived until recently at Machynlleth in Wales, below Cambrian mountains “grazed to destruction” and the source of both the Severn and Wye rivers. After previous Welsh floods, he dared to put the blame on the hill sheep. His comments on Countryfile raised a storm.This came to mind as I watched, appalled, the latest flooding of western UK. Both these islands share “extreme events” of unconscionable rainfall. An avalanche of soil unfurling on one Welsh hillside was so like the one that still scars the mountain round the corner in Killary harbour, opposite Leenane. Other Irish landslides have been far more damaging, and the Geological Survey has even mapped more potential sites.It has been three decades since I had to describe the severe overgrazing of western hills caused by the EU’s headage subsidies on unsustainable peatland. A great deal has changed since then, in reduction of sheep numbers, environmental grant schemes and enlightened local initiatives.The fabric of the hills has been slow to repair, as Nardus and Molinia grasses hold their grasp. Whole communities of mosses and liverworts have gone. Heather creeps back on the drier ground. but rarely to the height or luxuriance that once soaked up the rain and sheltered coveys of red grouse. For that, one has to visit, say, the protected slopes of Connemara National Park. Profound changeA different but equally profound change is the current exodus from hill farming. The toll of ageing aside, this is blamed on falling incomes. A study for the Irish Uplands Forum has found these well below the average industrial wage and almost wholly composed of basic EU farm payments. The bulk of sheep, however, are still held on the western seaboard and on uplands in the south and east. More than 800,000 head are mountain ewes. As ageing farmers drop out, their land is often annexed into neighbouring “ranches”.A concern expressed by Teagasc researchers is that “vast tracts of commonage will become . . . completely abandoned” because their condition is seen as agriculturally worthless. Neither the EU nor Teagasc can bear the thought of uplands smothered ungrazably with unmanaged heather, gorse, willow scrub or trees – all vegetation that might be expected to hold back the rain.For many ecological enthusiasts, leaving “vast tracts” of Irish hills to nature, or restoring them with native trees, would be ideal. New woodlands of Scots pine, birch and sessile oak flourish in their dreams.Before the postglacial climate change, many centuries ago, brought its own relentless rains, Scots pine was the dominant tree of the uplands, but there’s no chance of its unaided regeneration. One man in Co Wicklow carries a bunch of pine seedlings on his hill walks and plants them where he can, protected inside little barricades of rocks.Enduring fantasySome of the growing legion of hillwalkers might, perhaps, be moved to read The Man Who Planted Trees, Jean Giono’s enduring fantasy, and carry a pocketful of sprouted acorns of the native sessile oak. Prodded deep into any likely crevice of mineral soil, who knows? Until, I fear, the first snip from a passing sheep. Meanwhile, treeless blanket peat has absorbent values of its own, soaking up both water and atmospheric carbon. In his book Feral, Monbiot was irked to find the EU opposing upland tree planting on the grounds that it would release too much carbon from the soil. One of many objectives in a new “Wild Atlantic Nature” project, backed by the EU Life programme, is “removal of encroaching trees and shrubs” from blanket peatland in protected areas along the Wild Atlantic Way. These, no doubt, would include rhododendron and the lodgepole pines self-sown from ageing Coillte forestry.“Restoring” the bogs in 24 SACs along the Wild Atlantic Way faces a pessimistic description from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a lack of any national conservation plan for blanket bogs, even in protected areas.The project lists the causes of damage: “Centuries of peat cutting, reclamation, burning, drainage and invasive species. In more recent decades afforestation, over- or under-grazing, recreation and infrastructural developments . . . ”Add in “low levels of public appreciation” of how peatland matters to climate change, or why communities should feel a caring ownership for the local bog, and you might wonder where to start."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189346.1583017318!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus first case of covid 19 confirmed in republic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer of the  Department of Health during a press briefing on Friday. Photograph: CollinsThe first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Health said on Saturday.The patient, a male in the eastern part of the country, is currently receiving “appropriate medical care”. “The patient was identified and tested in line with established protocols for the investigation of suspect cases of Covid-19,” the department said in a statement.“The case is associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case.”Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin on Saturday night, officials said the process of getting in touch with people who were in close contact with the man is just beginning.“This process will take some time, but the people who need to be contacted will be contacted,” said Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.The person who had contracted the disease followed the advice of public health authorities and identified himself, enabling the diagnosis to be made, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, Dr Tony Holohan said.“We are confident the systems we have in place, and that we’ve worked on for months, will work well,” he said.Officials declined to specify the nationality of the person, whether he travelled on public transport, what airport he used, whether he travelled alone and whether this case is connected to the case reported in the North several days ago.Dr Holohan said officials had to be careful about the amount of information provided. The reason for not providing more information was to protect the identity of the person affected and to avoid the person being identified publicly. This would lead to a feeling among the public that their privacy would not be protected in the event that they contacted the disease.Dr Holohan, said the case was not a surprise and had not changed the view of officials about containing the disease. “There is still a high likelihood of containing the spread of this disease. We still have a high degree of confidence. The change of developing the disease in this country is extremely low”.Up to last Friday, 115 tests had been carried out on suspected cases of the coronavirus, but all proved negative up to that point. The Department of health said Minister for Health Simon Harris had been informed of the case and has notified Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Harris said: “This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this since January. “I would strongly encourage people to follow the guidance and advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, led by the chief medical officer.”Conference callMr Varadkar and Mr Harris earlier held a conference call with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on Saturday as the unidentified woman in Northern Ireland who recently came home from Italy and was suspected of being infected with the Covid-19 or new coronavirus, had her case confirmed.Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris were joined on the call by Ireland’s deputy chief medical officer, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, health minister Robin Swann, and the Northern Ireland chief medical officer, the Government said in a statement.They discussed the situation regarding the virus on the island of Ireland, and also internationally, and noted the good co-operation in place between authorities north and south of the Border.All agreed to continue the close co-operation and to remain in close contact in the period ahead, the statement said.On Saturday the NI Public Health Agency (PHA) said it had received notification from its counterparts in England that the one presumptive case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland had been confirmed by the reference laboratory it was sent to. The family at the centre of the case has asked that their privacy is respected given the personal impact of this issue, a PHA statement said.The public in Northern Ireland have been advised that they have full access to the National Health Service’s 111 helpline, though the British service is only being made available for people from Northern Ireland in relation to coronavirus guidance and not for other conditions.Sinn Féin MLA Colm Gildernew welcomed the high-level meeting. The party health spokesman said: “It is essential that public health authorities north and south work closely together and co-operate and community effectively in order to deal with this health emergency.“Infections don’t recognise barriers or borders and neither should our approach.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"People in contact with man who travelled from Italy to be identifiedGarda\u0026iacute discover quantities of heroin and cocaine during searches of car and residenceThousands left without power as Met \u0026Eacuteireann issues series of wind and rain alertsBaby Jensen arrives just seven minutes into February 29th\u0026lsquoThat is not Tullamore\u0026rsquo: Locals voice support for plan to house asylum seekersFatal road incidents occurred in counties Louth, Monaghan and Cavan since FridayGarda\u0026iacute say no injuries after incident near Maam CrossOrganisation says governments need to wake up before disease spirals out of controlDaniel Grainger found following public appeal for informationSupplements may slightly reduce heart disease while marginally increasing prostate cancer riskHouse in Coolock Village on Friday night man currently detained in Ballymun Garda stationStatus red, the highest level warning, issued for Clare and Galway as winds batter countryThe most hated man in rural Ireland? \u0027It\u0027s wrong\u0027, says the defeated MinisterMark Condren named press photographer of the yearInidual speaker\u0026rsquos award goes to Rachael Mullally representing UCD LawDriver and passenger pronounced dead at scene of collision with jeep on Friday eveningMet \u0026Eacuteireann says people should \u0026ldquostop everything and stay indoors during red alertStudents nationwide carry out protests against proposed on-campus rental increasesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187838.1582894224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice wash your hands and avoid hugging kissing and hand shaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A spectator wears a face mask at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis ATP Championships  in Dubai. Photograph: Ali HaiderEPAWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world and one case now confirmed on the island of Ireland, much of the focus is on how to deal with the illness and care for the sick.But equally important, if not more important, in what is still a containment phase is how to minimise the odds of contracting the virus and stay safe as the illness spreads.The first and best advice is not to panic. Hysteria is a real enemy in a situation like this.“We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” World Health Organisation head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Thursday night. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” he added.There has been a huge amount of speculation about the illness, much of which is ill-informed or speculative but what we know for certain now is that the Covid-19 coronavirus is new and scientists are assessing how it spreads.We also know that similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets.’Social distancing’That is why so-called “social distancing” will be important in the days ahead. That means you should move at least a metre away from anyone who appears ill if you can. Avoid shaking hands or hugging or kissing people as part of a greeting.There has also been a lot of talk in recent days about face masks and alcohol based hand sanitisers but - by far - the most effective way to protect yourself is by regularly washing your hands.At the risk of stating the obvious, a quick rinse under the tap doesn’t get rid of dangerous germs. Hands need to be vigourously washed with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds or the length of time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song twice.Many people don’t dry their hands either which is why it is important to remember that damp actually can help germs to breed and allows them to spread more easily onto whatever you touch next.According to advice from the HSE, in addition to hand-washing people should also use alcohol based hand sanatisers if necessary.It is also important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze and to put used tissues into a bin and then wash your hands again. People should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth if their hands are not cleanThe HSE advice also reminds people to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.With regard to face masks the HSE advice is simple. People who are well or have no symptoms of illness should not use them. “There’s no evidence that using masks is of any benefit if you are not sick,” it says.People who should use face masks if they have or may have coronavirus or if they are in close contact with someone who has or may have coronavirus or if they are are a healthcare worker in close contact with people who have or may have coronavirus.Healthcare workersAccording to the HSE people who work in a healthcare setting can best protect themselves by regularly washing their hands and covering their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing.Health care professionals dealing with cases or suspected cases of the coronavirus are being advised to wear personal protective equipment which includes a surgical face mask, a face shield or goggles, gloves and a clean, non-sterile, disposable long-sleeved gown. “If this is not available, wear a plastic apron and roll up sleevesIrish people displayed a propensity to stockpile during the two or three days that the beast from the east made its presence felt two years ago.Bread supplies dried up and fresh meat and dairy disappeared from supermarkets as supply chains displayed a worrying fragility.Will something similar happen if panic about the coronavirus mounts? Possibly.Certainly in other locations concerns over shortages have led some people to stockpile and there has been evidence of panic buying.Already in this country all the face masks have disappeared from pharmacies and even hardware shops.“I don’t think it is necessary, and I certainly don’t advise it,” Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh to New Scientist this week.Food suplyJennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland told the same magazine that people should ensure they have at least three days’ food supply to hand as they are advised to do during hurricanes. “I’m not saying it’s specifically necessary in this case,” she said.Meanwhile virology blogger Ian Mackay recommended slowly building up a “pandemic stash”.Certainly do not stock up on prescription medicines - not only will you almost certainly not need them but you may make it harder for those that do need them to access them. Which takes us back to the start and the best advice which is don’t panic.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189274.1582988514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"truck overturns on co galway road during storm jorge","story":"A video of the truck overturning has circulated on social media.

Photograph: Corinna KernReutersIsrael keeps having elections, but nothing really changes.On Monday, Israelis will go to the polls for the third time in a year after elections last April and September failed to result in a majority government. According to the polls, the stalemate is likely to continue and a fourth election cannot be ruled out.Binyamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party was trailing the centrist Blue and White, led by former top general Benny Gantz, by two or three seats for most of the campaign, but in the past week the trend has been reversed, leaving the two parties tied or, in some cases, Likud with a slight edge over its main rival.More important in the context of who will be the next prime minister is the standing of the respective party blocs, and the two main groups remain more or less tied , with both falling short of a 61-seat Knesset parliamentary majority.Here, Netanyahu has an advantage as his right-wingreligious bloc looks solid, whereas Gantz has rejected relying on the support, even from outside the government, of the predominantly Arab Joint List, without which he has little chance of forming a government.The key player in the coalition-building will, once again, be Avigdor Leiberman, the former defence and foreign minister, who heads the right-wing, secular Yisrael Beiteinu party, which gets most of its support from immigrants from the former Soviet Union.This time round Leiberman, whose party is projected to win seven or eight seats in the 120-seat Knesset, has made it clear that Yisrael Beiteinu will not recommend to President Reuven Rivlin that Netanyahu be tasked with forming a government.Jerusalem courtTwo weeks after the election, on March 17th, Netanyahu will face three judges at the Jerusalem district court to defend himself on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in the country’s most significant corruption trial to date.He denies any wrongdoing in accepting luxury gifts from billionaire friends and rejects the allegations that he traded favours with Israeli media and telecom chiefs in return for positive news coverage.The Israeli electorate will decide if Israel’s longest -serving leader will also become the first sitting prime minister to fight a criminal case while in office. He is not required to step down unless ultimately convicted.Netanyahu dropped his request for parliamentary immunity when he realised it would be rejected by the Knesset members. However, the opposition now fears that if he wins the election he will push through a Bill postponing the trial as long as he remains prime minister.Blue and White had hoped that the grave allegations and the start of the trial, so close to the election, would herald the end of the Netanyahu era.“On March 17th, Netanyahu will lose his mandate and his trial will begin,” said Gantz. “Do you want a prime minister who goes on trial? Netanyahu will go on trial and we will take over.”Dramatic impactThe polls show that Netanyahu’s trial and other significant events during the election campaign – such as the January launch of the United States Middle East peace plan, billed by Donald Trump as the “deal of the century” – failed to have a dramatic impact on voting intentions.Netanyahu engineered a number of events in the run-up to the election in the hope of winning votes: the promise of annexation of West Bank settlements and extending sovereignty to the Jordan Valley in the immediate aftermath of the release of the US plan securing the release of backpacker Naama Issachar, who was being held in a Russian prison the promise to bring an additional 400 Jews from Ethiopia to Israel and the promise to build hundreds of new homes for Jews in east Jerusalem.However, the polls registered no significant shifts.Political pundits are finding it difficult to see a way out of the impasse, based on the pre-election polls.Benny Gantz has previously been open to the idea of a unity government with Likud, but he has made it contingent on Netanyahu stepping down in order to tend to his legal troubles. While Blue and White could theoretically swear in a minority government together with Yisrael Beiteinu and the left-wing Labour-Meretz list, it would have to rely on the Joint List for support from outside the government on key votes.Not only is Gantz opposed to forming a government that depends on the backing of the Joint List: the Joint List declared that it won’t vote in favour of a government that includes Leiberman.Elections used to create genuine excitement in Israel with rising passion as election day neared. No longer. Election fever has been replaced by election fatigue.The biggest talking point of the election has been how to handle the thousands of voters who are in home quarantine after returning from countries hit by the coronavirus. The government decided to erect a few dozen designated polling tents in major cities for such people but is finding it almost impossible to recruit staff to work in the tents, even though they will all be issued with protective gear.Another stalematePeople dread the prospect of another stalemate and a fourth election but it appears that the only genuine prospect of a functioning government is a unity coalition including both Likud and Blue and White. Last time round the question of who will serve first as prime minister prevented such a scenario.Blue and White agreed to show flexibility on its commitment not to sit with Netanyahu but only if Gantz served first as prime minister, and Netanyahu agreed to dismantle the right-wingreligious bloc provided he was allowed to serve first. Nothing has changed since then.Even if the deadlock again prompts talk of a unity coalition as a way to break the impasse, the key sticking point remains. Is Netanyahu going to serve first and remain prime minister during his trial, or will Gantz serve first and Netanyahu return as premier after his trial is over – assuming that he is acquitted?If this question cannot be resolved after round three, then get ready for round four.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt

back.Diplomatic debate has long raged over returning alleged historic plunder like the Elgin Marbles.A clause covering these supposed imperial spoils has even appeared in negotiations between the UK and EU.Now French historians have demanded the repatriation of Napoleon III whose remains are in a tomb in a church in Hampshire.France’s final monarch died in exile and was laid to rest in Farnborough 147 years ago.Historians in France hope to secure the ultimate artefact of imperialism and have Bonaparte’s body returned as part of deals being made in the wake of Brexit.Historians in France hope to secure the ultimate artefact of imperialism and have Bonaparte’s body returned as part of deals being made in the wake of Brexit.A request has been sent to the Foreign Office asking Government to consider Napoleon III, nephew of the bellicose emperor defeated at Waterloo, in any future negotiations over returning cultural treasures. The leader founded France’s Second Empire and presided over what many see as a Gallic golden age before his ignominious defeat to Prussia. French historian Dimitri Casali is leading calls for the symbol of his nation\u0027s glory to be brought home, and has formally asked the UK Government to consider the emperor\u0027s repatriation. This follows the EU adding an Elgin Marbles clause to its demands for a post-Brexit trade deal, and it is hoped a spirit of international amity will prevail“This is the moment,” Mr Casali told The Daily .  “I think it’s a gesture, the body of Napoleon III could be a sign.   “It will be an elegant gesture of reconciliation between England and France. “We created the Entente Cordiale.  Perhaps this could be the second Entente Cordiale.  It could be a sign of solidarity.”Napoleon III was laid to rest in St Michael\u0027s Abbey, Farnborough, three years after he was defeated by Otto von Bismarck and fled across the Channel.  His wife Eugenie is buried nearby.  As president and then as monarch he supervised vast imperial and economic expansion, along with a cultural flowering and the beautification of Paris.  Some academic voices in France argue the emperor should be returned to his glittering imperial city as a grand symbol to educate and inspire the nation far more than the banal figures of politics. “He was a very, very great man,” said Mr Casali.  “It’s very important for France to have the body of Napoleon III.“England has their Royal Family, but we have nobody, we have Macron.“France had been a monarchy for 1,000 years before it was a republic.  He represented the republic and monarchy.”Mr Casali, who has support from other academics, has requested that the Foreign Office consider the emperor\u0027s entombed body in future diplomacy between the UK and EU nations.It comes after the EU added a clause to its trade demands some believe could pave the way for the Elgin Marbles to return to the Parthenon.The clause says negating parties should “address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin.While the famous marbles may return to Athens, Saint-Augustin in Paris has been suggested as a fitting final resting place for the exiled emperor, who was in power from 1848 to 1870. There is no more space next to his uncle, who was returned after his own death in exile, in Les Invalides. It is understood from the Ministry of Justice that the Catholic monastic community in which Napoleon III currently rests would have to give their consent for his removal. More from NewsMore from The We urge

surrey contract","story":"Health officials were last night trying to establish how a Surrey man contracted coronavirus amid mounting concern a contagious person is unaware they are infectious.The patient became the first person to catch the illness within the UK, prompting claims it represented a new phase in the spread of the disease.As the number of people in the UK infected with Covid-19 rose yesterday to 23, the Surrey case remains the only one where the patient, understood to be male, has not become infected after travelling abroad to virus hotspots.The Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and Public Health England last night refused to confirm whether a Surrey-based doctor who may have treated the patient was taken to a specialist unit on Friday after showing symptoms of the virus. Although he has not yet been formally diagnosed with the condition, the Haslemere Health Centre in the county temporarily closed to the public following a deep clean. It reopened yesterday, shortly before Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and South West Surrey MP, said on Twitter he was “thinking of clinicians, staff and patients at the surgery during this worrying time.He added: Thoughts today with new Covid19 patient and local GP with symptoms alongside their families.It is believed the Surrey doctor has a wife who also works as a medic. It is not known whether she has shown any symptoms or is ‘self-isolating’ as a precaution.A number of staff at the Haslemere GP surgery who were contacted by the Sunday  refused to comment. One employee simply said: “I’m not allowed to say anything. I really don’t want to get into trouble.”The prospect of a doctor being infected is of particular concern because it is likely he or she would have close contact with vulnerable patients attending appointments. The focus on Surrey intensified yesterday when The Prince of Wales, a pub in Haslemere, announced it had closed “until further notice” for a “deep clean” after a “customer who visited tested positive for coronavirus”.In a statement posted on social media, the landlords Nick and Becky added: “We are all well, no symptoms. This is purely a precautionary measure. We are just trying to do our bit to help.”It is not known whether that customer was the Surrey patient who may have gone to the Haslemere health centre.Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, said it was not clear if the Surrey man had contracted the virus directly or indirectly from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.Ruth Hutchinson, Surrey County Council’s interim director of public health, said she was in continuous contact with Public Health England, adding that those not contacted by either organisation should “go about their life as normal but take extra care to follow public health advice … to help reduce the risk of infection.” If it is confirmed a Surrey doctor has the virus he would be the second GP to contract the illness. The first was a medic in Brighton who worked at Worthing hospital.Of the three cases announced yesterday, two had returned from Italy and the other from Asia. Officials are trying to trace who they had contact with. The patients are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire.Tonight a staff member at Willow Bank Infant School, in Reading, Berkshire, was revealed to have tested positive for the virus.In an email sent to parents on Saturday night they were urged to stay calm and follow recommended hygiene procedures.The school, in the suburb of Woodley, is to be given a deep clean and will be closed for a few days amid growing fears there will be a wider outbreak.The email, from head teacher Michelle Masters, states: “We regret to inform you that we were told today that one of our members of staff has tested positive for the Coronavirus, Covid-19.The school will be shut for some days to allow for a deep clean and to ensure that the risks of infection remain low.We will be in contact to ensure that you are kept updated.“I am sure you will join with me to wish the affected member of staff all the very best for a speedy recovery.”The Foreign Office confirmed it was supporting the family of a British man, believed to be in his 70s who lived abroad, who became the first UK citizen to die from the virus.The man, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off Japan\u0027s coast, was the sixth person from the vessel to have died.David Abel and his wife Sally were both on board that ship and now undergoing treatment for the virus in hospital. They took to social media to express their sadness that a fellow British holidaymaker had died.In a YouTube video Mr Abhel said: Sad news this morning, wasn\u0027t it? We awakened to that, to hear that one of the Brits has sadly passed away in hospital out here in Japan.Our thoughts, our concern is for all of the families left behind. We are fortunate, we\u0027re doing OK, we\u0027re being really, really well cared for.More than 700 tourists have become infected on the Diamond Princess.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met new york updating british galleries show wealth built slave","story":"The dark side of the British Empire and its foundation on slavery and cheap labour is being emphasised in a major revamp of one of the world’s greatest museums.New York’s politan Museum of Art has redesigned its British galleries to highlight the troubled history of the empire as a way of illustrating this country’s rich tradition of arts and crafts.The galleries, which open to the public on Monday as part of the Met’s 150-year anniversary program, hold a rich display of British decorative arts, design and sculpture from the 400-year period between Henry VII and Queen Victoria, including a large collection of teapots and china figurines.The museum says it has made its collection “relevant to a contemporary audience” by  emphasizing the development and growth of the British Empire “with all of its systems of exploitation”.Wolf Burchard, the Met’s curator, told artnet news: “For all the beauty of these objects, the British empire was the backbone of the British economy and the funds made available to produce these things is in part due to the empire and the slave trade—and you have to acknowledge that.”One gallery, devoted to “Tea, Trade, and Empire”, explores the period with 100 English teapots displayed in a pair of ten-foot-tall semicircular cases.In another section an anti-slavery medallion made by the Wedgwood pottery workshop, showing a man in shackles, appears alongside an 18th-century plan of a slave ship.Another display is a figure from 1719, produced in China by the Cantonese artist Amoy Chinqua, showing an East India Company entrepreneur whose imports from China, India, and the West Indies included tea, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, as well as porcelain, cotton, mahogany, and ivory, “produced at great material and human cost, and then transported thousands of miles” for the benefit of Britain’s new middle class.The Met’s publicity material for the display states: “The new narrative offers a chronological exploration of the intense commercial drive among artists, manufacturers, and retailers that shaped British design over the course of 400 years.“During this period, global trade and the growth of the British Empire fueled innovation, industry, and exploitation. Works on view illuminate the emergence of a new middle class—ready consumers for luxury goods—which inspired an age of exceptional creativity and invention during a time of harsh colonialism.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"michael bloomberg using digital media 2020 election","story":"The text message looked like ordinary political spam. Mike Bloomberg is the president we need to unite our country! it read. The next message, however, was more unusual: Please disregard. Vote Bernie or Warren.In fact these messages, first reported by the Los Angeles Times, were not sent by a campaign staffer or an enthusiastic volunteer. Instead they were the work of a financially stressed recent graduate from Sacramento, California, one of more than 500 Americans who have signed up to bombard their friends and social media followers with pro-Mike messages for a cool $2,500 (per month.This unusual scheme – a slightly cleaner and much more generous recreation of China\u0027s 50 cent army of pro-government online trolls – is part of an unprecedented digital advertising blitz from the former New York City mayor, who on Tuesday will formally enter the race to be chosen as the Democratic Party\u0027s nominee for US president. It is emblematic of a candidate who has sought to short-circuit the contest by carpet-bombing it with money from his gigantic personal fortune – but also one who has pushed the boundaries of what is permissible in a political campaign.Not that Bloomberg can\u0027t afford it. According to Forbes, he is the world\u0027s eighth richest man, with a net worth of around $60bn (compared to Donald Trump\u0027s $3.1bn) derived from an empire of financial data terminals. His pitch to voters is taht he is smarter, richer, more successful and far more sophisticated (though not taller) than the carnival barking clown currently occupying the White House, and that he is the boss who can whip America into shape. In practice, he has struggled for breathing space with a crowd of other Democratic moderates who have so far failed to unite against the surging, socialist Bernie Sanders. Still, though Bloomberg will only actually appear on ballots from Super Tuesday, when a huge number of delegates are up for grabs in 14 simultaneous state elections, he has already spent more cash on Facebook and Google adverts than every other major presidential candidate combined.The aim of this bonanza is to beat Trump\u0027s superlative 2016 effort, which Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth recently described as the single best digital ad campaign I\u0027ve ever seen from any advertiser. Or, as Bloomberg\u0027s campaign manager Kevin Sheekey put it last month: We’re gonna spend Trump out of office. The 78-year-old mogul has promised to keep up the shopping spree even if he loses the nomination (including to Sanders). But at times his tactics have bordered on spam, fake news and social media manipulation, leading one expert to accuse him of hacking your attention.In one case, Bloomberg\u0027s campaign sent out a clip of a TV debate which had been edited to make his opponents look far more stumped by one of his attack lines than they really were. Aides defended it as an obvious parody. In another, the campaign tweeted a series of satirical quotes from Sanders praising various dictators, only to delete them after a backlash. It also commissioned a horde of sponsored posts from Instagram influencers, flagrantly violating a ban on politicians running any such campaigns. After that, Instagram actually reversed the policy, and now asks only that candidates and their influencers flag the sponsorship using an official tool.Most controversially, Twitter last month banned 70 accounts that had tweeted identical pro-Bloomberg messages, accusing them of beaking platform manipulation rules originally designed to stop Russian influence campaigns. It is unclear whether these accounts were entirely fake identities or whether they were simply members of the $2,500 army who had copied the Bloomberg campaign\u0027s boilerplate messages instead of crafting their own. Neither Twitter nor the campaign responded to requests for comment.Yet according to Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who has extensively studied Russian covert campaigns, Bloomberg\u0027s methods are drawn less from government government trolls and more from corporate shills. The comparison to Russia is so absurd, she says. The appropriate comparison is astroturfing, in which people are paid money by pharmaceutical companies or whatever to go onto social media and talk about how wonderful their headache medicine is. Normally the US would regulate that as a consumer protection issue  – but DiResta says that election authorities have failed to draw up matching rules for politicians.Groeling, meanwhile, argues that Bloomberg is embracing a tried-and-tested Trumpian tactic: trolling the media to pay attention to what he wants them to pay attention to. The edited video clip, for example, happened to feature Bloomberg\u0027s best moment in a debate that otherwise went badly for him, meaning he may have gained more positive spin from reports that questioned his tactics than from the clip itself. The same is true of Bloomberg\u0027s fake Sanders tweets: everyone who saw them being debunked was also exposed to the claim that Sanders supports dictators, even if they had never heard it before.In other words, Bloomberg might be the first truly post-Trump candidate: a rival oligarch, shameless about his wealth, who is willing to bend the truth and incite controversy in order to hijack the spotlight. Some have therefore feared that his victory would herald the end of American democracy as we know it. But Groeling is more optimistic: yes, Bloomberg has spent a staggering amount of money, but he is far away from actually winning Democratic voters and has suffered in every arena that he does not control.The true test of Bloomberg\u0027s plan will begin on Tuesday – and it may yet transpire that its only real winners are a handful of ordinary hustlers who will breathe more easily paying this month\u0027s rent.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands asylum seekers ferried eu border pawns turkeys political","story":"Thousands of migrants were trapped on Saturday in a squalid no-man\u0027s-land beyond Turkey\u0027s border with Greece, as the realisation dawned on them that they had become pawns in a political stunt hatched by the Turkish government.Huddled crowds from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria gathered on a narrow road that sits between Turkish and Greek territory, their path to Europe blocked by razor wire and armed EU border guards.Less than 24 hours ago, many believed their prayers had been answered when the Turkish government announced it was opening its side of the border and laid on a fleet of unmarked, white buses to ferry migrants to its frontier with Greece. Now they are stuck in freezing temperatures with little food or water, resorting to pulling down tree branches for firewood and erecting makeshift tents, as it becomes clear that the path to Europe has been tightly sealed.Just yards away from angry confrontations between migrants and border guards, children no older than four or five, who were wrapped up in coats and wooly hats, ran around in the mud. A Greek government spokesman described the wave of migration as an onslaught, adding that it would do whatever it takes to protect its borders. And in Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hinted at border closures in the event that Greece failed to keep the crowds at bay.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, has long threatened to let refugees into Europe if they don\u0027t meet his demands. His latest move marks the most serious escalation in his attempts to secure more help from Europe and Nato in tackling the refugee crisis in Syria, where almost a million have fled war in Idlib province in recent weeks.   In a speech on Saturday Mr Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, claimed that 18,000 people had amassed on the border and threatened to send a further 30,000.But in reality the number of people gathered at the main crossing, near the Turkish city of Edirne, appeared no higher than 5,000, while in nearby Ipsala a Turkish police officer said around 500 people had arrived.In what may soon become a sprawling refugee camp unless the crowds are dispersed by Turkish forces, women and children huddled around fires, masking their faces from the smoke.Rumours swirled at the border on Saturday about Turkish authorities transporting most of the migrants back to Istanbul at the end of the weekend, should Mr Erdogan feel his point has been made.The majority of those gathered in Edirne were young men, who angrily shouted at the Greek soldiers guarding their side of the border, behind a barbed-wire fence that stretched as far as the eye could see in each direction.Further south, dozens of migrants were attempting sea crossings to the Greek island of Lesbos in dinghies, with limited success.Some migrants claimed they had been beaten by Greek police, and that in at least one incident those who tried to cross into the EU had their shoes confiscated.Others told the Sunday  of their devastation as they realised they had been duped were now trapped at the border, Many who were unable to board free buses have resorted to paying taxi drivers around 100 lira (£12) and claim they are now out of money.Some migrants rode in on the back of pickup trucks driven by locals hoping to make some easy cash. Meanwhile, a group of taxi drivers bartered with migrants at a crossing near the Turkish town of Ipsala for transport back to Istanbul, after they gave up on entering Europe.Abdullah, an 18-year-old Afghan who came to Turkey with his five siblings six months ago, said they felt their hearts leap as they were waved across the Turkish side of the border, only to be greeted with barbed wire, soldiers and tear gas at the Greek side.We are devastated...we haven\u0027t even tried to cross again because we are too scared. One group today came back without any shoes, cell phones or bags. They were confiscated by the Greek police, he said.They lied to us, they said we could leave and now we are trapped here. We just want to go back to Ankara now but we don\u0027t have the money. I have no idea what to do.One Iranian refugee who said he was fleeing the theocracy in Tehran accused Mr Erdogan of ensuring him and his friends in a cruel political game, while two women from Somalia said they were ready to go back to Istanbul.Most of the people gathered at the border did not appear to have arrived from Syria\u0027s war-torn Idlib province, as they said they had already lived in Turkey without social security or ID cards for more than a year.We have been waiting for four years for this chance and now we are stuck here because the other side is closed, added an 18-year-old from Kabul who gave his name as Hourshid.We have jobs in Turkey but we left them to come here. Now I guess we have to go back.Since 2016, under the terms of the EU-Turkey migration deal, Ankara has been halting refugee flows towards the EU, which in turn agreed to give Turkey €3billion (£2.3 billion) and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU\u0027s foreign policy chief, has said that the Turkish government has offered “reassurances” that Turkey intends to continue abiding by that agreement, even though its side of the border has been thrown open.As groups continued to arrive at Edirne on Saturday evening, Turkey continued to pile pressure on Western leaders for more military support on Syria and used the threat of more migration waves into Europe as a key bargaining chip.Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said the government has urged the United States to provide Patriot missiles as backup in northwestern Syria, following Syrian regime airstrikes this month which killed 55 Turkish soldiers.The Turkish president also called on Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to step aside in Syria and allow Turkish forces to battle the Syrian regime alone.As night fell on Edirne, yet more migrants began to realise they had been duped as part of a cynical geopolitical game.As they trudged back through no-man\u0027s-land, they passed the sign in Turkish which had greeted them 24 hours earlier, when they were filled with false hope of safe passage to Europe.Turkey\u0027s border is its honour, the sign says.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean? And why does it matter?Stock markets in America and Europe have now entered official “correction” territory due to coronavirus fears.After a slight respite on Wednesday stock indexes across the world on Thursday continued their downward lurch as news emerged of more cases of Covid-19 infections outside China.\u0026nbspWhy have coronavirus fears knocked $3 trillion off stock markets?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJapan announced today that it will shut every school in the country next Monday, affecting 13 million pupils, in order to contain the disease’s spread.But what does a stock market correction actually mean?And why does it matter to ordinary people?It’s simply where shares are trading more than 10 per cent below their recent peak in value.On Thursday afternoon both the S\u0026ampP index of the 500 largest US companies and its (rough) European equivalent the STOXX 600 were down over 10 per cent on where they were a week ago.Because traders have woken up to the potential global\u0026nbspeconomic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.If growth stalls and company supply chains are disrupted by measures by governments to contain the virus that will be bad for company profits – and a hit to company profits translates into lower share prices.Nothing magical happens after a stock index falls by a tenth.But it’s a round number and that can be important in the psychology of traders.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It may give rise to a further cycle of fearful selling.It could presage a 20 per cent decline in values, the definition of a “bear market”.More broadly, falling share prices matter in that many of us are invested in stock markets through our pension or other saving schemes.So when markets\u0026nbspfall, we are worse off.It’s estimated that more than $3 trillion of value has been lost from listed companies across the world this week.\u0026nbspHowever, providing we are not about to retire tomorrow we shareholders are only worse off on paper. Shares in the long term have tended to rise.Any other reason to be relaxed amid the market mayhem?Some analysts argue that major stock sell offs and corrections can be healthy if they bring an overheated market down to earth.“Stocks have moved upwards for many months without a significant correction — and there is a compelling argument to make that a correction is overdue,” says Kristina Hooper of Invesco.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only other similar object was spotted in 2006 and has since left its orbit around the Earth.Earth has a new ‘minimoon’, scientists announceThe newly discovered satellite will also leave Earth’s orbit, in the coming months, leaving\u0026nbspastronomers scrambling to get images of the object and understand its origin.“Obtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates.

Since October 2016, GOP registration has dropped by half a percentage point. Democrats have actually declined by nearly a full point over the same . Independents have benefited from both drops.And they have been doing so for years. Democrats are more than three points off their peak this century, which was in 2008 when Barack Obama was about to become president. At the time, 43.62 per cent of voters were registered Democrats.Republicans are also more than three points off where they were four years earlier, in 2004, when 32.79 per cent of voters were Republicans and George W Bush won re-election.Since 2008, the trendline for each party has been relatively steady. But while Democratic registrations fell more between 2016 and 2018 (0.78 per cent) than Republicans (0.15 per cent), Republicans have fallen more since 2018. Since Democrats won back the House of Representatives in that midterm, their registration numbers have declined by just 0.16 per cent, compared to 0.37 percent for Republicans.Bernie Sanders polling higher than Elizabeth Warren in her own stateThese numbers, it bears emphasising, aren’t the full picture and differ from surveys of party registration. While national pollsters like Gallup ask samples of Americans to self-identify which party they align with, these numbers represent actual party registrations, and they only account for the 31 states that actually have party registration. When you ask people in all 50 states to self-identify, Independents do significantly better, and Democrats do significantly worse the most recent Gallup data show 42 percent of people identify as Independents, and more identify as Republican than Democrat, 30 percent to 27 percent.Indeed, part of the reason we still have many more actual registered Democrats is that some Southern and Appalachian states still feature more registered Democrats than Republicans, even though those states have been voting reliably Republican at nearly every level of government for years and years. Louisiana, for example, has more than 300,000 more registered Democrats (1,216,000) than registered Republicans (905,000). Blue states are also more likely to have party registration than red states.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers need officials to deliver a thousand and one things.“And on top of the Brexit tasks there is also the day job of counter terrorism, organized crime, policing and drugs.”But Ms Patel’s allies last night retaliated to dub Sir Philip “a classic, old school establishment mandarin” who is overly cautious.One said: “He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out ‘no’, just lots of ‘ooh minister, that’s very courageous’”.One recent victory attributed to Sir Philip was to signicantly simply the new points-based immigration system, stripping it down from an original more complex plan.It can then be built on over time, once it is up and running and offering visas to businesses in the Autumn.One senior Home Office insider dubbed it “a big clash of cultures, a risk manager versus a radical reformer”.As well as the Home Office, the Departments for Transport and the Environment as well as HM Revenue and Customs are also under heavy strain.“Cracks will appear” in them too soon, it is predicted.Insiders say Government lawyers are under the most pressure of all because of the need to draft so much new legislation and treaty agreements, both with the EU and other countries.The Home Office last night refused to deny Sir Philip has issued warnings.Instead, a Home Office spokesman said: “The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of  allegations appearing in the media.“They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Am I mad  Actually, I think I’m pretty sane, although I may be biased.I’ll explain my reasoning.My abstinence from clothes shopping is no big secret. I’ve mentioned it many times before but I guess in these times of impending climate doom it’s trendier now. The irony, not buying clothes is in fashion.It’s a bit like feminism.That used to be “those bra-burning crazy women”  but now it’s OK. Cool, in fact. Probably because we live in a much more “woke” society.It must be my Blue Peter upbringing. After all, I’m always saying Blue Peter was woke before woke was a thing — the appeals, growing produce in the greenhouse, making things, inclusivity, ersity. It was ahead of the game!Often we overcomplicate matters, overlooking the easy option. Take not buying more clothes, for example. It has so many advantages . . .❶ Keeping your old clothes is a good incentive to stick to the same weight. I pretty much stopped growing by age  so everything I’ve owned since then still fits. Plus I don’t really wear tight clothes either, so fluctuating by a few pounds here and there is OK.❷ I’m pretty lazy and the thought of having to go shopping for clothes feels like a big effort. Even buying online is hard work.What to buy  Will it fit  How do Iit  What a hassle. When I was younger, I liked to shop with friends. But that novelty wore off long ago.Now, as a mum, when I see friends all I want is to have good conversations.❸ Not being fashionable is liberating. You don’t have to hang out with people who judge you on what you wear. You can hang out with people that like you for you. When people glance me up and down to check out my rags, I have a secret sense of satisfaction that I no longer worry what they’re thinking.❹ It’s way cheaper to not buy stuff. Think of all the money you’ll save.❺ I won’t bang on about it but clothes, consumer goods and stuff in general in our society are becoming too dis­pos­able and our Earth can’t cope.

She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.The mandarin claimed he had received allegations about Ms Patel shouting and swearing and creating fear among staff.He added he was offered a payout to go quietly but will instead sue the Government for constructive dismissal.The Sun revealed last night the clash erupted after Sir Philip warned the Home Office will struggle to deliver major Brexit tasks on time.His warnings infuriated Ms Patel, who sees him as “the new Philip Hammond Eeyore”, her friends say.It was also claimed Ms Patel ordered Sir Philip to sack a senior official on Christmas Eve, and he refused.Communications director Andy Tighe, a former BBC journalist, later decided to retire.Only days ago Sir Philip and Ms Patel released a joint statement saying they were both deeply concerned about  reports MI didnt trust her with intelligence.Sir Philip is the third senior civil servant to leave the Home Office since Boris ally Ms Patel took charge in July.The department has been tasked with devising a new points-based immigration system, a border inspection regime and a settlement scheme for EU citizens by the end of .It is also drawing up complex new rules on cooperating with EU nations on crime and intelligence after the end of the transition period on December .I take this decision with great regret after a career of  years.I am making this statement now because I will be issuing a claim against the Home Office for constructive dismissal.In the last ten days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign.It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the Home Secretary.This - along with many other claims - is completely .The Home Secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office.I regret I do not believe her.She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.Even despite this campaign I was willing to effect a reconciliation with the Home Secretary, as requested by the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Prime Minister.But despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this.I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal - and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts.My experience has been extreme but I consider that there is evidence that it is part of a wider pattern of behaviour.One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our , people.This created tension with the Home Secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours.I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.I know that resigning in this way will have very serious implications for me personally. The Cabinet Office offered me a financial settlement that would have avoided this outcome.I am aware that there will continue to be briefing against me now I have made this decision, but I am hopeful that at least it may not now be directed to my colleagues or the department.This has been a very dficult decision but I hope that my stand may help in maintaining the quality of government in our country, which includes hundreds of thousands of civil servants loyally dedicated to delivering this governments agenda.I will make no further comment at this stage.One senior figure said last night: “Philip is concerned by the risk of so much happening at once, some of which is very tricky. Ministers need officials to deliver a thousand and one things.“And on top of the Brexit tasks there is also the day job of counter terrorism, organised crime, policing and drugs.”But Ms Patel’s allies hit back, dubbing Sir Philip “a classic, old school establishment mandarin” who is over-cautious.One said: “He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out no, just lots of ‘ooh minister, that’s very courageous’.”An insider called it “a big clash of cultures, a risk manager versus a radical reformer”.Public school educated Sir Philip, , had been permanent secretary since April .Amber Rudds friends blamed him for her having to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal.In  he sparked outrage by saying he wasnt an expert on immigration as he sidestepped MPs questions on Commonwealth subjects being wrongly deported.He later emailed staff and said he was proud of how they handled the fiasco despite a report damning their failings.IS Britain governed by elected ministers or holier-than-thou civil servants Bolshy mandarins like Sir Philip ­Rutnam too often believe they are really running the country.His decision to quit and go to war on former boss Priti Patel revealed the type of breathtaking arrogance which triggered this showdown in the first place.As the highest ranked civil servant in the Home Office Sir Philip should be a model of probity, diplomacy and restraint.Yet his unprecedented public outpouring of vitriol would have seemed extreme from the victim of a two-footed tackle in the Manchester derby.Sir Philip had reportedly resisted the Home Secretary’s challenging timetable for post-Brexit reforms. This even earned comparisons with former Chancellor Phil “Spreadsheet” Hammond, another stick-in-the-mud Eeyore. But though senior civil servants should advise ministers discreetly, ultimately they must do their bidding.The Government won its large majority on a manesto of change. It cannot be ruled by Sir Humphreys, employing every trick in the book to delay and frustrate those elected to enact the will of the people.Sir Philip is a £,-a-year knighted bureaucrat who will no doubt end up with a gold-plated pension far beyond the dreams of ordinary workers.Instead of bleating he should face the reality of the situation.If he can’t or won’t do the job, the Government has to get someone who can.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is probably the safest place in the country.Earlier this week another man in Surrey tested positive for the virus, although there is nothing to suggest the cases are linked.He had recently been to Milan but did not visit any of the towns that are now under quarantine after a major outbreak that has infected almost  people.And a school in the county - All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham - was shut on Wednesday because staff and pupils showed mild symptoms after a half-term trip to Italy.Across Britain,  schools have closed or turned away pupils because of coronavirus fears.Dr Alison Barnett of Public Health England said after the Haslemere case emerged: Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to usethey become unwell in the  days after contact with the confirmed case.This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.The Department of Health and Social Care added: The virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus is unclear at this stage.We do not currently have complete understanding of the chain of transmission in this case, but there is no immediately identiable link to overseas travel.Given the recent increases in international case numbers, especially Europe, it is highly likely that we will soon see some instances of community transmission in the UK.There are now  infected people in England, one in Northern Ireland and one in Wales.And yesterday the first Briton died of the Covid- illness, a man in his s who caught it on the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan.NHS officials are now drawing up a battle plan to tackle the outbreak amid fears one in ten Brits - around seven million people - could end up in hospital with coronavirus.And Boris Johnson will push emergency powers through Parliament next week.It will give state authorities sweeping powers to take action against the deadly coronavirus outbreak.The British Army is reportedly on standby to step in as the epidemic looms - with barracks bookmarked as potential quarantine zones.Brits are facing months of coronavirus chaos with sporting events, gigs and schools on lockdown to stop the spread of the killer bug.Many Boots stores have sold out of hand sanitiser and face masksOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes, there have been more than , confirmed cases of coronavirus in more than  countries around the world.But in the UK, where more than , people have been tested, there have been  confirmed cases.To date, there have been no deaths in the UK from coronavirus and only one Brit — an elderly cruise ship passenger in Japan — has died in total.So when Covid- is routinely referred to as the “killer virus”, that is something less than the whole truth. Because most people unfortunate enough to catch it recover.Even in China, where there have been over , cases, the ­numbers of ­infection are slowing.Containing the virus works. As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines.

Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

an area described as a final stand for Biden.CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer wrote yesterday that the state contest means everything for Biden, particularly after losing badly in Iowa and New Hampshire, and being placed a distant second in Nevada.Zelizer adds a stark warning: If Biden does not win in South Carolina, the state his campaign thinks will help him rebound, it could easily be the end of the race for him.If the day ends with Bernie Sanders on top, or even a very close second, there will be considerable pressure on Biden to step down.Bidens senior adviser, Anita Dunn, told ABC News that hes pinning his hopes on a real bump in the primary.She said: I think South Carolina has always been a special state for Joe Biden.He has a lot of friends down here, and a lot of relationships that pre-date his relationship with Barack Obama.Reuters reports that Bidens second-place finish in Nevadas caucuses a week ago has boosted his campaign, while polls show he is well positioned to win South Carolina.His campaign has for months argued the state would serve as a firewall given his strength among African-American voters, and Biden himself has suggested anything less than a victory would damage his campaign.Keen to win financial support on the back of a supposed victory, Biden told reporters in Greenville: If we win solidly here I think its going to raise us a lot of money as well and a lot of enthusiasm.However an undeterred Sanders said yesterday that he was in striking distance in the state.When we started this campaign here in South Carolina, I think we were  or  points behind. Weve made up a lot of ground, Sanders added.With Super Tuesday looming, even a comfortable victory in South Carolina might not be enough for Biden to blunt the momentum of Sanders.Biden is not the only candidate for whom South Carolina and Super Tuesday may represent make-or-break moments.After disappointing finishes in the first three early voting states, Senator Elizabeth Warren is hoping her assertive debate performances of late will translate into electoral success.Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who finished third in New Hampshire, have lost ground as the primary calendar has shted to states with more erse electorates.Both have done well with white, educated, moderate Democrats.But they have struggled to connect with non-white voters.After South Carolina, Biden will also face competition from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has blanketed the country with half a billion dollars in advertising. Bloomberg skipped the first four states and will be on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday.President Donald Trump asked the crowd at a rally in North Charleston on Friday whether Biden or Sanders would be the better Democratic opponent for him.“I think Bernie’s easier to beat,” Trump added.Polls in South Carolina close on Saturday at pm.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Like millions of other couples, they have lived together for a while, and now they are having a baby and getting married.Even the way they got that dog, Dilyn the Jack Russell rescue puppy, is reminiscent of other ­couples who get a pet because they have not yet got a baby.Boris is by nature an optimist. He presses ahead where more cautious career politicians would hang back, worried the whole thing would upset too many voters, especially those of an old-fashioned disposition.But Boris has horried them already, by becoming the first Prime Minister ever to live with his girlfriend in Downing Street.Old-fashioned voters ought to be delighted that he is now getting married to Carrie.He has always loved having children, the more the better as far as he is concerned.And he loves being married. This may seem a curious thing to write of a man who will have twice been orced, once the formalities to end his present marriage have been completed.But Boris is not one of those men who regards commitment with terror. With boundless optimism, he dismisses the doubts that might have held him back.His first marriage, to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, whom he met at Oxford University, was not a success. She had appeared on the cover of Tatler, was famous for her beauty and was a sympathetic and sensitive person.But she could not bear being married to such a driven man, who worked with titanic energy to make a success of his chosen career of journalism.She and Boris were completely incompatible, and very soon the marriage broke down.His second marriage, to Marina Wheeler, was in many ways a great success, and lasted for a quarter of a century. They had four children, and were clearly very much in love.From time to time Marina threw him out of the house for having affairs, but she did not generally hurl him into outer darkness.He would instead find himself staying, during these periods of banishment, with mutual friends.But one cannot imagine Marina, a successful lawyer with socialist convictions, would ever have been happy living at No as the we of a Conservative Prime Minister.Carrie will embrace that role. She has worked for the Conservative Party, understands how it works and sympathises with its aims.Ministers for whom she has worked pay tribute to her acumen.Only two PMs before Boris have ever got orced: the Duke of Grafton in the eighteenth century, and Sir Anthony Eden, who succeeded Churchill in .As so often, Boris is breaking new ground, determined to do things his own way, unwilling to observe conventions for which he can see no point.In the theatre of politics, he puts on a performance unlike anyone ’s, and of which not everyone can approve, but which everyone finds themselves talking about. He got into the Commons in  but was soon criticised for ious gross failures of responsibility.When he was found to have lied to the Press about his affair with Petronella Wyatt — he dismissed the story as “an inverted pyramid of pfle”, when actually it was entirely true — he was sacked by the then Conservative leader Michael Howard from the front-bench team.This meant that in  Johnson was in no position to run for the leadership, and had to watch fellow Etonian David Cameron take over. A less resilient character would have abandoned politics for a well-paid career in newspapers and television. Johnson went off and became Mayor of London.He reached the top on his own terms, and now he is doing something wonderfully conventional he is getting married. Good luck to him and his bride, and congratulations on their forthcoming baby.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leadership contender quotes the assassinated US president word for word: “We choose to go to the Moon and do other things not because they are easy but because they are hard.” And that is how the Wigan MP sees the challenge of leading the Labour Party – a hard job, not an easy one. The very existence of Labour is now under threat and in her words it must “change or die”. She adds: “We have to win the argument and we haven’t been making the argument. By the time of last year’s General Election no one was listening. “We’d had four years of factional infighting and cared more about talking to ourselves. So when Labour made promises people just stopped listening. We have to rebuild trust in the Party. We can do that but it will be hard.”  Lisa backs taking railways back into public ownership, and decentralising – as opposed to nationalising – energy firms so communities are in control. She is also keen to take decision-making out of Londoners’ hands and spread it wider. Her plan for the future of the BBC is to give licence fee payers a direct say on who runs the Corporation by electing directors to the board.  She adds: “The people who determine what is made and when it’s aired sit behind a desk in London. It’s not a national conversation.” On social media she says: “There’s a particular problem for women MPs in constituencies where there’s been huge economic decline. We need proper regulation as for mainstream broadcasters.” On dealing with anti-Semitism she wants a lower threshold for suspending Labour members, an independent process to st allegations and more transparency.She says: “We need to be open about the scale of the problem.” The bookies put Lisa, , in third place behind rivals Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey in the contest to be decided on April . Lisa trails with only  local party nominations compared to  for Sir Keir and  for Rebecca. But she is still bullish, saying she is “most likely” to benefitthe race goes to second preferences.

He added: “I regret I don’t believe her.” He claimed that speaking out would mean losing the ­generous payoff offered by the Cabinet Office to buy his silence. Sir Philip, a loyal civil servant for  years, was probing claims that Ms Patel ­shouted, swore at and “belittled” staff. A well-placed Whitehall source said: “Priti must be toast now.

She is a symptom of what is wrong with this government. It’s unheard of for a Whitehall mandarin as senior as Sir Philip Rutnam to quit as dramatically as he did yesterday. And to publicly accuse the Home Secretary of being a bully and a liar is unprecedented. Sir Philip was one of Whitehall’s Sir Humphreys who obey a strict code of omerta. They may pull the strings behind the scenes but they never – but never – speak out publicly. For him to be driven to do so, and give up a handsome payoff to boot, shows there is something rotten at the core of government. And the worst of the bad apples are in Downing Street – Boris Johnson and his sinister sidekick Dominic Cummings. Their goal is to turn a healthy Parliamentary majority into a toxic tyranny. And they will destroy anyone who stands in their way. A ministerial adviser is marched from No to the dole queue by armed men. A chancellor is told he can keep his job but onlyhe sacks his staff. The PM and Cummings put the BBC in Coventry, but will not go to Coventry or other cities when they flood. And they behaved asbedridden when coronavirus first emerged. Only now are they awake to the threat.  Mr Johnson demands to be treated not as first among equals but as Dear Supreme Leader, a dictator firing off commands from deep within his No bunker. And a blind eye is often turned when ministers bully and harass their hardworking staff who do their best to look after us. Sir Philip’s actions yesterday will most likely end in Ms Patel also losing her job. But sadly there is a way to go before Boris Johnson loses his. Priti Patel has got something right though.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs glaciers melt and temperatures rise, the devastation caused by ­climate change can be found here at home... on these muddy slopes that should be covered in snow at this time of year. I’m standing in the Cairngorms National Park, where two million visitors a year enjoy skiing, hiking among the snow-capped peaks and, until now, husky rides from Alan Stewart’s Cairngorm Sleddog centre. But in April,  years after he and we Fiona opened up near Aviemore, the centre will close its doors for ever because it just doesn’t snow enough. Alan, , tells me: “Climate change has finished us off.” His centre is the first business to shut in the area due to global warming. The writing was on the wall in  when Alan’s pack of  Siberian huskies began moulting in winter as warm weather confused their normal cycles. And this year, instead of snow, Alan says: “We just have mud.” Alan, who has welcomed Sir David Attenborough and Bear Grylls to his centre, goes on: “Weaposve got ospreys nesting close to us and I’ve seen them affected by the rain. “I’ve seen flies in the middle of winter because the place is so warm. Craziest thing of all is Iaposve got huskies moulting in the middle of winter – that tells you what nature is saying to them, to us. “To train dogs professionally you need several months of snow but even in Europe you cannot get enough snow.” The park, in the eastern Highlands of Scotland, has seen declining wildle, putting endangered species at risk, because of the lack of snow cover. The Cairngorm Mountains, covering  square miles, are losing snow cover at an alarming rate. Once encrusted in ice and snow for most of the year, a third of it has disappeared over the past  years. It could be snow free by temperatures continue to rise.  A report by the Cairngorms National Park Authority says experts estimate there “is likely to be a substantial decline in the number of days of snow cover” by . It also warns of flooding and a loss in bioersity. I visited the UK’s last wilderness, the set for BBC’s Winterwatch, to discover the impact of ever-warmer winters. Mountain tops have just a smattering of snow and conditions are more like spring. The white pistes at Cairngorm Mountain ski resort, near Aviemore, are turning to barren slopes. To counter that, resort chiefs invested in a snow maker which spewed out almost  tonnes of articial powder every day for more than a month before the season opened.  Snow and ice are also of great signicance to the wildle here. These mountains are home to  per cent of Britain’s endangered species, like rock ptarmigans – a white game bird and relic from the last ice age –  pairs of golden eagles and  pairs of ospreys. But this delicate inter-action of wildle and plants is beginning to buckle. The ptarmigan and mountain hare, both native species which change colour to blend in with the snow, are pushed further up the mountains to avoid being picked off by predators. Another victim is the mysterious sparrow-sized snow bunting.  While thousands overwinter all around the UK from the Arctic, only  pairs are believed to now breed near the tops of the highest mountains in Scotland, making their nests at the edge of patches of snow to eat frozen larvae. Conservationists want to protect the capercaillie – largest member of the game family and one of Scotland’s treasured birds. Breeding has been hit hard by increasingly wet and erratic weather in spring and early summer. Despite spending a morning dedicated to trying to spot one under the watchful eye of wildle guide Duncan McDonald, we fail to find one.  erhaps not surprising as numbers have dropped to just over , from around , in the s. Speyside Wildle is one of several operators which rely on tourists lured by the rich wildle and the area’s whisky distilleries. But even these have been hit – a heatwave in  halted production as water ran dry. There are also fears for another iconic Scottish species – the Atlantic salmon. Once abundant,  saw a low of , caught across the country. On the banks of Loch Morlich, Will Boyd-Wallis, head of land management at CNPA, explains: “This is an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. It’s a breeding space for them. If the water gets too hot then these eggs are not going to be viable and the salmon are not able to breed. It’s important we keep that water cool.  “One way this occurs is through the melting of the snow, which can last until June. With less snow, this is going to have a big impact.” Ski workers literally see the effects of climate change up close.  Jim Coorfoot, who has worked at Cairngorm Mountain ski centre for  years, said: “Stormy weather is stripping away the snow. Last year was one of the worst on record. “Normally there is a reliable source of snow at the top of the mountain but we have had to switch that to the bottom with the use of a machine. “I worry it will accelerate quicker than we can mitigate against. ­ Typically at this time of year the slopes would be covered but the weather now is just so unpredictable.” Temperatures up here this decade have been almost a degree warmer and five per cent sunnier than average.  Lee Schofield, of Highlands and Islands Weather, offers free forecasts to tourists. He cited temperatures in Carrbridge – . degrees higher last month than in January . The rise mirrors staggering reports from Antarctica, where a record high of .C was recorded this month.

The firm is not only distributing and sharing child abuse, it is commercialising it.” The group wants a global regulator with the power to fine porn sites.  The story echoes the  hacking of stars such as Jenner Lawrence whose intimate pictures appeared on other porn websites. Pornhub, which has  million hits a day and is worth an estimated £.billion, boasts categories like UK Teen Snapchat, Young Teen Snapchat and Leaked Teen Snapchat. Ms Isaacs added: “Pornhub can argue that people in these videos are pretending to be teenagers, which some might be.

The first victim was treated at Haslemere Health Centre, Surrey, before going to Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London.

The former crime boss left an Italian hideaway to join celebrations – in Lancashire, of all places – for Marisa Merico’s th birthday. It was a milestone both father and daughter never expected to see. For Marisa recalls loved ones being killed as she grew up – before taking over the Mafia reins herself when her dad was in jail for two murders and other crimes. And Giovine, , has had a bullet with his name on since turning informer on Milan’s feared ’Ndrangheta gang.  Marisa says: “It is such a celebration, as at one stage I didn’t think I would make it to .“It could have been very dferent, given my former le. Many people in my family died young because they were involved in the Mafia. “Many were gunned down or died as a result of drugs, so the fact I’m here today celebrating with Dad is very special.  It is the first time in  years he has been back to England and  years since he has left Italy. “When I met him at Manchester Airport I just hugged him so tightly, it was such an emotional reunion. I can’t believe he is here, where I have lived most of my le. It’s surreal.”  The birthday bash at a country hotel near Marisa’s Poulton-le-Fylde home marked the first time she had seen her father in more than six years. He now lives under a secret identity and is even airbrushed out of family photos. Giovine became a marked man after testying against his fellow ’Ndrangheta mobsters. He ran a drugs and arms racket before being jailed in the late s and ’s. That was when Marisa – then just  – took over, smuggling arms and cash across borders and mixing with notorious mobsters. She was jailed for two years and nine months for using £.million of laundered Mafia money to buy a house in England.  Marisa was held in Durham Prison alongside murderers Rose West and Myra Hindley. But Marisa turned her back on crime and spoke about her past in an interview with the Sunday Mirror six years ago – after a cloak-and-dagger meeting with her dad. These days, she is a contented grandmother of two. When not giving talks about her le, she is studying for an honours degree in criminology and wants to help prisoners change their lives. Marisa’s le story was turned into a book – Mafia Princess – and is being filmed for Italian Amazon Prime. She wore a Versace dress as her kids Lara, , and Frank, , joined her at her bash – and The X Factor finalists Tre Amici were the star turn.Giovine says: “I’m so proud of Marisa, she is so lovely and beautul. To be here is so wonderful. I was absent for so many birthdays that I had to be at this one. “Family is everything, to be here with Marisa in England is a dream come true. I was so emotional when I saw her, I cried like a baby. I missed out on so much and I am very sorry for that. “I was flying around the world or in prison, I didn’t spend the time with her that I should have.”  Marisa says: “There were many times Dad hasn’t been able to be there – my wedding day was one. “There was a price on his head and a gang were after him. He wasn’t able to give me away. We decided it was too risky. Thank God we did. As I pulled up in my wedding car there were men on bikes with guns waiting for him. “They wouldn’t have thought twice about killing me in the crossfire. As Dad wasn’t there they didn’t shoot but it could have been very dferent.” Marisa was born into the mob after her mum Pat – a Blackpool teenager working as an au pair in Milan – fell for Giovine. His mother Maria was known as Granny Heroin for her ­ruthless leadership of the city’s Ndrangheta gang. Anything – anyone – could be used for gain... including Marisa when she was a baby. Giovine hid contraband in her cot and in  of his car as he smuggled cigarettes across the Alps on family “holidays”.  Marisa recalls another crime run, saying: “I went to Klosters where Dad did a deal with a big arms dealer and I had to pretend I went to a posh English school.” Her parents split when she was one. Pat took Marisa back to Blackpool when she was nine. But she ed each summer and remembers, aged just , posing with a doll in one hand and her dad’s gun in the other. At , she ed to Milan and joined “the firm”. Marisa delivered up to £, to gangsters in Seville, Spain. She married henchman Bruno Merico – father to Lara.  Marisa recalls: “Dad sent Bruno and I to Calabria to pick up an arms shipment. It was a -hour drive with me, a distraction in a tight dress, sitting almost on Bruno’s knee as the weapons took up so much space. At dawn we stopped for a coffee and saw five carabinieri cars at the service stop. We decidedwe drove on and didn’t stop it would look suspicious. “So we had a coffee. By the time we were going the policemen were standing right by our Citroen. We got in and, cool as you like, took off like Bonnie and Clyde. This was our le.” Marisa also left sums of £million at drop-off points to be laundered or used to buy weapons or drugs.  She even hid money in her daughter’s carry cot – just like Giovine. When police started closing in, Marisa came back to the UK before being nicked herself. She and Bruno orced in  and she had son Frank during a relationship with Frank Birley, who was shot dead while Marisa was pregnant.

First they tweeted that ­“people of all political stripes” like a cuppa, pointing out that Jeremy Corbyn had been pictured with their brand in , then pleaded for a bit of kindness as the abuse got worse. Finally they told one ranter: “Sue, you’re shouting at tea!” It sparked dozens of memes and was a welcome dose of humour on a social media site renowned for its hatred, mob mentality and endless echo chamber rows. While that Sue is probably fed-up with Twitter now, it gives me a glimmer of hope that all is not lost. A quick search on the internet reveals tweets that left me in fits of laughter. A young American news reporter delivering a traffic report in the snow caused huge shrieks from tweeters when he accidentally activated his Snapchat filters while recording a piece to camera. Viewers saw reporter Justin Hinton turn into, among other things, a Star Wars pilot, a racoon and a wizard. He finished with a pair of googly eyes. Afterwards, Justin told followers he loved seeing how happy his mishap had made them. Another woman posted she had just ­realised that mamma mia sounds like a northerner telling their mother they’re home: “Mam, I’m ’ere.” Yet another posted the picture of her new credit card – complete with numbers – to show off the new blue colour.

Lauren McGarry gave birth to twins Sonny and James prematurely during an emergency C-section after doctors told her and husband James that Sonny was carrying too much fluid.The -year-old mother from Scotland told the Daily Record : As soon as James was born I heard him cry, but when Sonny came out he didnapost and they had to resuscitate him. It was absolutely terrying.Doctors suspected the babies had aposTwin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndromeaposmeaning it was unlikely both twins would survive and kept taking scans to monitor them both. But during a scan doctors noticed Sonnyaposs fluid levels were dangerously high and she had to have the baby there and then. She said: We were both terried. I just remember laying on the bed, but I was behind a curtain, but James could see all the staff in the room and he said there were dozens and dozens of them. Iaposm glad I couldnapost see because I was already terried. After trying to fit both babies with feeding tubes they realised Sonny had been born with a rare disorder called OA TOF which meant he was unable to swallow. A baby with Oesophageal atresia and Tracheo-oesophageal fistulahas a gap in his or her oesophagus which mens they are unable to swallow saliva or milk. Lauren said: We had never heard of it so we were just shocked and scared and obviously confused. The doctors were saying aposhe canapost swallowapos and I just couldnapost wrap my head around it. I mean, how can you not swallow  It was devastating. The couple were then devastated after being told Sonny would have to undergo surgery at just two days old and the family were transferred to Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children.  Sonny had a six-hour surgery to repair his oesophagus. Lauren said it was the aposmost horrendousapos six hours waiting for the operation to finish. Thankfully his operation was successful but the effects of OA TOF will impact Sonny for the rest of his le.  We feel very grateful that the surgery was successful, but we also know that Sonny will have to be careful for the rest of his le, she added. He will always be more susceptible to chest infections, reflux and coughs. He will always have to watch what he eats because although his oesophagus is now joined, it will always be narrow at that repair, so he will be more susceptible to choking. It is very scary as parents because we are currently weaning the boys and we have to be incredibly careful about what we give him to eat.

Rewind  years and I was on the first series of The Apprentice, a groundbreaking show where viewers started to realise, wow, women can be as good as men in the boardroom. If not better. And The Apprentice saw a massive surge in people setting up their own ­businesses too, from the dot mavericks to the whole ­“mumpreneur” movement. It all sounds great, yet here we are in  and most kids – and their parents – still naturally presume it’s men with all the brains and ­business know-how. I just helped out with some research on this subject and, as a woman running her own business and as the mother of a daughter, I made some depressing discoveries. Only two in  children in high school could name ANY women who had set up their own ­companies. So they had no clue about Jo Malone, who sold her fragrance and candle ­business for undisclosed millions. Or Estée Lauder. Or Sahar Hashemi, who set up the first coffee chain, a certain Coffee Republic. Or even Victoria Beckham, who launched her fashion and beauty brand and is now worth millions. And  to -year-olds were more likely to think of a man when it came to making money and being bold enough to build a company. More than six out of  young girls said they have never even considered starting up their own business. We can’t blame them. They have been programmed into thinking this way. When we see successful women, whether they are on social media, TV or in magazines, the focus is still on their clothes and their hair or their make-up and their weight. Not on their talent, skills or ­business sense. But we should be championing these women and making them true role models.  We need to give our young girls the confidence to believe they can have their own business – and the country will be better for it too. It is thought up to £billion could be added to our economywomen started and scaled new businesses at the same rate as UK men.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThese amazing and selfless ­teenagers are taking singing from the same song sheet to a whole new level. Not only do they perform in a choir but they are also united by the ­sacrices they make in their personal lives. Each of them juggle school work with caring for their parents or siblings with le-limiting illnesses such as chronic pain, autism, multiple sclerosis and depression. The ten-strong Young Carers Aloud is the brainchild of Laura Jones, , who single-handedly cared for her mum after she had a nervous breakdown ­followed, in , by a heart attack. Five years ago Laura, who volunteered at young carers’ charity Action for Children from  and studied theatre and media at ­university, hoped to start a song-writing workshop. She said: “I wanted to use performance and music to help these amazing young people. “Singing was always my therapy, my way to heal and find a calm place, and I wanted these little heroes to ­experience that too. “I know how hard it can be to find the time and cover to come to ­rehearsalsyou’re a full-time carer, but I did everything I could do make that dream a reality. Then a colleague of mine at the charity suggested I put a choir together to sing them.” Since then Young Carers Aloud, the UK’s first choir made up solely of young carers, has recorded an album of their own material.  They have also starred in a ­musical and performed at London venues ­including in front of  people in St Paul’s ­Cathedral last October. Laura, of Mountain Ash, Rhondda, said: “I’m like Sister Mary Clarence from Sister Act, getting these children who’ve never sung before not just to enjoy themselves but to find their own voices and also create the tightest possible bonds. “Nothing brings you together more than singing in a choir, and being a carer can be the loneliest, crushing experience ­imaginable. I grew up in poverty as a carer but was adamant I’d make something of my le. I owe that to music. “I held down three jobs to afford to go to university and I made it. I wanted to bring that strength back to The Valleys, to give these kids who dedicate their lives to others ­opportunities and friendships which will last a letime.” Caitlin Brewis, age  Caitlin, who goes to Cardinal Newman RC Comprehensive in Pontypridd, has been a carer since she was nine years old, and joined the choir last year. She said: “My younger brother Zach, who’s eight years old now, is severely autistic, and because my mum and dad are separated and mum works night shts, I spend a lot of time dealing with Zach. I have to get up early to prep him for school, make his breakfast and do all the little jobs a parent would. “It’s exhausting in a way nobody  could really understand unless they’re a carer. “Being out of the house with people my age who get me, it’s a leline. My favourite song is We Will Rise Again, showing we’re stronger together. It hits the nail on the head.”  Caitlyn Homer-Hughes, age  Caitlin has been a carer for her mum Gail since she was diagnosed with MS eight years ago. The pupil at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun comprehensive in the Rhondda Valley had never sung before joining the choir three years ago. She said: “Everyday tasks for mum are just impossible so I have to do everything from cooking to washing Mum’s hair. It’s also really hard for Mum, who feels so guilty for putting me in this position. “Rehearsals, performances, and trips away are the highlight of every month.”  Ffion Corcoran, age  Ffion has juggled studying at Aberdare Community School with caring for her mum Donna, who suffers from depression and anxiety, for the past two years. She said: “Our nan, Mum’s mum, died two years ago and it massively hit her, leaving me almost overnight to pick up the pieces. It’s so hard, getting up at am to prep my younger sisters Cerys and Bronwyn for school, as well as helping out at home with everything . “In the choir I feel at home and happy for the first time in so long. I forget how tired I am when I’m singing.” Corey Barker, age  Corey says the choir is a relief from years of caring for his mum and sister, . The Treorchy Comprehensive pupil’s mum has chronic back pain. He said: “Some days mum’s in so much pain she can’t get out of bed, so I have to cook, clean, do the shopping. It’s become the norm now but it doesn’t get any easier. “The songs we sing make us all feel less isolated. I regularly well-up when I’m singing, the emotion is so powerful and healing. It’s a blessing being part of this.”  Kasey Chapman, age  A first-year student at Coleg Y Cymoedd Nantgarw, Kasey has been a carer for eight years for her mum Natasha, who has severe endometriosis and is in chronic pain She said: “As well as mum, I also have my younger brother Cameron, who’s , and sister Leora, who’s nine, so I’m often up very late at night to get all my coursework done. “It feels like every single minute of the day I’m looking after someone , doing laundry or cooking, or helping with homework, not to mention emotionally supporting mum. “In the choir we share stories and laugh so much. We can relate to each other, and hearing someone next to me singing lyrics about being together, being stronger, it puts a huge smile on all our faces. “All of us are heroes.” Arrabella Eames,  Arrabella looks after both parents while a pupil at St John the Baptist High in Aberdare.Since she was nine she has been caring for mum Claire, who has chronic pain after a bus accident  years ago. Dad Stephen, is a diabetic and has arthritis .She said: “As well as all the chores I often help Mum and Dad get dressed as well as being strong for them, which isn’t easy. Putting Mum and Dad first has obviously taken its toll, which is why the choir is a great escape. It’s better than any medication. Each song is so beautul and personal.”  Arwen Braddock,  Arwen has been a carer since she could “walk and talk”. The Mountain Ash pupil’s twin brother Ewan has extreme anxiety, dyspraxia and other issues. She said: “My dad works full time and my mum suffers from depression so I’ve had help with everything from cooking meals, sorting out his unorm, helping re-teach him stuff from school. “If I ever get a chance to see my friends, I often have to head back early to deal with a situation. The choir is a safe, healing place where everybody understands what you’re going through.” Brodie Townsend, aged  Five years ago Brodie became a carer for her mum, Wendy, when she was diagnosed with severe PTSD and depression. Brodie Townsend, , is in her second year at college at Coleg y Cymoedd Llwynypia in Rhonda. She said: “Because mum’s not allowed to work, it’s up to me to cook, clean, and look after her as well as my younger brothers Stanley, , and Murdoch, . My dad left us when I was  and we moved town, so every morning I’m at am to make breakfast for everyone and clean up before dashing to college, then the moment I’m home it’s non-stop, too. “The choir gives me energy, helps me concentrate and brings me out of my shell.” Keira Phillips, age   For four years Keira has cared for her mum Sharon – who has anxiety, depression, PTSD and is bipolar – while studying at Aberdare Community School. She said: “I have to make sure mum takes all her tablets, take her to doctors’ appointments, as well as doing all the home stuff. On a bad day I have to get Mum out of bed andshe’s in a bad way, take time out of school, which means I’m playing catch-up at break and lunch. My two older sisters, Beth and Charlotte, moved out of home a few years ago. “In the choir I feel like I’m me, I’m alive again. I remember how performing in front of over  people at St Paul’s Cathedral last year was mind-blowing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman slashed across face pub","story":"NewsWoman slashed across face in pub attack needs  stitches to close in woundKeelan Burke, , used a kne or glass to permanently disfigure the -year-old woman, who suffered horric injuries in the Christmas Eve attack in Willenhall, near Walsall, West MidlandsShareCommentsByChris KitchingMatthew Cooper:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsKeelan Burke has been jailed for  years for his attack on the woman \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Horses, dogs and cats were rescued from a dilapidated property filled with dead creatures, with some carcasses so decomposed they could not be identied. Rescue charity - the Green Valley Brittany - discovered the horror with horses and donkeys being found with horrically overgrow hooves and cats and dogs surrounded in the property by dead animals. Laura Kling, president of the charity, has been working all week to recover the animals. She was called to the house which she says was occupied by two women, one who recently died. Her daughter reportedly suffered from mental health issues and was taken to hospital. The  animals had been living in terrible conditions for weeks, with many having already died. It is thought the wealthy owners, who lived in Saint-Hernin, Brittany, north west France, collected pure breeds. Laura added: This case is absolutely tragic and shows the harsh reality of mental illness.  Laura said: We checked out the horses and donkeys that were in the field and straight away saw the horror of what has been going on. All the horses have overgrown hooves, one was so bad he could no longer stand or walk. If we hadnapost come out that day we have no doubt that he would have been dead by morning. The charity managed to get a farrier to the farm to smooth down the hooves, and help the horse get to its feet.  Laura continued: We have never seen a horse with such overgrown hooves before.Heaposd endured so much suffering and probably been down on the ground in the horrendous stormy weather for some time.Unbelievably only one week before, two people had also been living in this place. The animals in the house were visibly traumatized and really fearful.  Incredibly, eventually the dogs and cats came out for cuddles, Laura said. Green Valley is now trying to care for and rehome all of the animals to Brits living in France and is asking for donations from all around the world to help them. People reacted in shock to the images on social media. Julie Franklin said: Absolutely horrendous. I canapost imagine what these poor animals have been through. I hope they will all survive and find their forever homes.

have made things much rosier at Dens Park.That’s coincided with the arrival of new signings like Christophe Berra, Christie Elliott and Conor Hazard.Berra is getting a lot of praise, and rightly so, he’s made a huge dference at the back.Crucially, though, the rest of the team have also upped their game.Jordon Forster has been excellent in the last three matches, heading and kicking anything coming his way with one of each of those resulting in the opening goal in the last two games.Josh Meekings is also looking like getting back to the player we all know he can be and his long throw has been an asset that’s appeared recently, too.Further up the pitch, Kane Hemmings is getting the service he needs and has been sticking chances away.The big job on manager James McPake’s hands now is to ensure those good feelings continue over the next few weeks.We’ve seen it too often already this season where it looks like the Dark Blues have turned the corner but then, as soon as that thought appears, their form has headed straight into a ditch.Saturday is a big game for them to show they can keep on the road to second spot and an easier play-off route.Make no bones about it, Arbroath is a far bigger task than taking on Partick Thistle and Queen of the South, no disrespect to the league’s bottom two sides.Dick Campbell’s side are full of it and loving every minute of taking on the big boys in the Championship.I have to admit I expected them to drop away as the season wore on but they are showing the kind of durability that can see them take a place in the end-of-season play-offs.After that, it’s Alloa at Dens and then Ayr home and away back-to-back before Dunfermline come calling – that’s four home games in the next five matches. vw, px\"  What a great opportunity to take the season by the scruff of the neck finally and put themselves in the driving seat for a shot at Premiership football next season.I expect Saturday to show whether Dundee can put the foot down and pull away from the teams in the middle of the ision or send themselves back into a spin.Whichever way it goes, I expect it to be a cracker between two good

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"famously-hawick-set-tour","story":"A PROJECT to promote Hawick has just launched an imaginative range of guided tours.Famously Hawick wants to provide visitors with an experience of the towns rich manufacturing heritage.And they hope the new all-year-round tours will demonstrate why Hawick gained an international reputation for producing high quality goods.These new lsquoexperience packagesrsquo are the latest development from the collaboration of premium producers in the town.Successfully launched last year, Famously Hawick promotes The Borders Distillery, Hawico, Johnstons of Elgin, William Lockie and Lovat Mill as the Cashmere, Tweed and Whisky town.But based on feedback, visitors didnt want to just buy the quality goods, they wanted to see where they came from and how they were made.As a result, Famously Hawick tour packages have been created.There are three dferent experience packages available - An Introduction to Famously Hawick, which is an independently led tour, The Famously Hawick Experience, which is a fully guided tour including lunch, and the Famously Hawick Gold Standard, which is a fully bespoke tour.The tours can be booked online at www.famouslyhawick"},{"url":null,"title":"council-spend-730k-new-hq-canteen-reception","story":"COUNCILLORS are set to rubber-stamp spending more than pound, on creating a new reception and canteen at their headquarters.As part of the forthcoming years budget proposals, pound, has been earmarked for the building with a further pound, to be spent on demolition of the old canteen.The proposals are part of the planned   capital spend.A spokesman told us: \"The existing staff canteen building at Scottish Borders Council headquarters, which also contains meeting rooms and storage, is le expired.\"The council is establishing a lsquograb and gorsquo facility as part of improvement works to the public reception area of the main headquarters building.\"This will enable the canteen building to be demolished, delivering savings in respect of rates, maintenance, lighting and heating."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-clark-driving-trail-cover-scenic-borders","story":"A CROSS-BORDERS driving trail has been created for visitors wanting to learn more about rallying icon, Jim Clark.The -mile adventure trail will take drivers on a tour of the Borders with pit-stops showcasing regional beauty spots as well as locations steeped in motorsport history.Launched by the Jim Clark Trust, the trail hopes to engage visitors and help them discover the places and stories behind the former double Formula One Champion, Clark.The trail starts and ends at the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum, Duns, and is completely free of charge as it is designed to enhance the experience had at the museum.From the museum, a trail map guides visitors to Chirnside, Jim Clarks hometown and final resting place, then to Berwick-Upon-Tweed where Jim began his racing career.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use

are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

improvement.Inspectors again visited the school in the summer of  before ing towards the end of last year.Ms Cook told the Courier: ldquoWe are very pleased that our visit from Education Scotland recognised the signicant improvements we have made across the school community.ldquoIt has been very much a team effort in getting us to this point and I would like to thank staff, pupils, parents carers and the wider community, who have all contributed to this journey.ldquoWe are keen to continue our progression and plan to focus on our vision and values, ensuring the best outcomes for all of our young people.The inspection, carried out by Carol McDonald, notes: ldquoSince her appointment in August , the new headteacher has led important improvements in the work of the school.ldquoShe has won the confidence and respect of staff and parents.ldquoShe is providing clear strategic direction for change and improvement.ldquoThe senior leadership team are working well together and providing effective leadership for guiding and managing the pace of change.ldquoThe values of ambition, respect and community continue to inform the le and work of the school.ldquoThe school has a relentless focus on the value of respect, resulting in improvements in daily interactions in and beyond classrooms.During Decemberrsquos visit, inspectors spoke with both staff and pupils about the school, while a questionnaire was filled out by pupils and parents carers.The report continued: ldquoThe school has placed a high priority on promoting respectful relationships and providing a positive learning environment for all young people.ldquoSenior and curriculum leaders have supported teachers well to reach a shared understanding of approaches which establish positive relationships for learning.ldquoIn most lessons, the ethos is now calm and purposeful.ldquoThis is an important improvement since previous inspection visits.ldquoYoung people relate well to each other and to their teachers.ldquoAcross the school, helpful routines are being established.ldquoYoung people have contributed meaningfully to the revised Promoting Positive Relationships and Behaviour policy.ldquoTeachers value the wide range of professional learning opportunities on relationships for learning.ldquoMost teachers now feel better equipped and empowered to manage behaviour that is more challenging.ldquoThis has lessened disruption in lessons and the number of calls for promoted staff intervention has reduced signicantly.The report also noted that there was still room for the school to continue to improve.Ms McDonald said: ldquoThe pace of learning, notably in S to S, should be increased further.ldquoToo many lessons are overly teacher-led, as evidenced through the schoolrsquos own self-evaluation analysis.ldquoTeachers should continue to improve approaches to ensuring all young people have learning tasks with appropriate levels of challenge.ldquoThe pupil learning team makes a valuable contribution to faculty reviews, which are shaping improvement priorities.ldquoTeachers are now using feedback from learners more regularly to make learning more effective.Lesley Brown, East Lothian Councilrsquos chief operating officer for education, said: ldquoWe believe the results of this visit accurately reflect the schoolrsquos improvement journey.ldquoWe have been working closely with the school to support its progress and have been impressed with the drive and determination that has been shown to improve experiences for its entire

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

I got the bus here today and walked through town and Irsquoll do the reverse going home. Itrsquos how I normally travel. Nobody comes near me. So, that side of it is easy to manage.Perhaps it shouldnrsquot surprise us that writers go unnoticed, but Doyle, you might think, would be a special case. Since his first novel The Commitments was published in  and certainly since it was turned into a movie a few years later, Doyle has been public property in Ireland. He won the Booker Prize for his  novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, seen his first three books turned into movies, and has been lauded and loathed in his home country for his presentation of Dublin and Ireland in novels and on the big and small screen. The first episode of Family, the hard-hitting  TV series about domestic violence and poverty was watched by half of Irelandrsquos adult population. And they all had an opinion on it. Politicians and church leaders railed against it. There was even a death threat made against Doyle. Things have, thankfully, rarely been so heated since but he remains part of the national conversation.Hersquos good at talking. So much so that he is about to embark on a -date Conversations with Roddy Doyle tour, which is the reason Irsquom here, although wersquoll spend most of our time talking about Dublin and time and mortality and the appeal of a Dublin pub.But the tour first. Where did the idea come from  ldquoAround spring and autumn invites to festivals come in, he begins, in way of explanation. ldquoThere seems to be a huge appetite for festivals. I donrsquot really share it, Irsquove got to say. I couldnrsquot get worked up about going to hear writers talk, but people in the production company and my agency have been to events that I do, and they enjoyed them, and they thought they were good standalone things.ldquoSo, I was persuaded and not with much dficulty to go on this tour. Itrsquos  events. Itrsquos not rock n roll. There is no rider. I wonrsquot be flinging the television out of the hotel window.No karaoke then  ldquoI wonrsquot be breaking into song, no. Not yet anyway.Instead, hersquoll do a bit of talking and a bit of reading. Among writers only fellow Irishman Sebastian Barry might be better at the latter. It is a chance to size up a letime of work.ldquoI have  novels to choose from and two collections of short stories so therersquos plenty, he says. ldquoIrsquom more comfortable looking back on my old work than I used to be. I used to just run away from it when it was finished as quickly as I could and become immersed in something new. And I still try to immerse myself in something new, but I donrsquot need to deny my catalogue.Why do you think you did in the past  ldquoI didnrsquot want to wallow in it. I was afraid I might try to replicate it. Probably the best decision I ever made when I won the Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke was to make the decision never to go back there, never go back to him. I forgot about that book to the extent that I almost forgot Irsquod written it and forgot that I had been involved in The Commitments movie, for example. Itrsquos when my kids started watching it years later that I began to reclaim it.ldquoI suppose Irsquom at an age where Irsquom calmer about it. The Snapper [his second novel about an unmarried teenage pregnancy] in this country, the film particularly, is known off by heart. Itrsquos on every Christmas. Itrsquos a family occasion. I did a stage adaptation and they did a great job but, in many ways, you didnrsquot need it. The audience could have sat there and recited it to one another and just laughed.ldquoThat seemed to me a terric thing. I felt very lucky. Irsquom happy to look back on that work now.Read More: \"Cant you feel the anger \" David Baddiel on social media trollsItrsquos dficult to think of a Scottish equivalent to Doyle, someone whose work has been so central to the national conversation from the beginning. Irvine Welsh at a push, maybe, but it is a big push. ldquoIrsquove always considered myself a political writer, Doyle suggests. ldquoI donrsquot look around for issues. I create characters and the characters bring issues with them. Irsquove written about characters who were unemployed, characters who were pregnant outside marriage at a time when that was very signicant, characters who have been victims of violence in the home. In the last novel Smile the narrator has been abused by a Christian Brother.ldquoI could spend a considerable amount of time in radio studios or on the phone claiming some sort of expertise but beyond my writing I donrsquot. My job is trying to tell a story. I very rarely go beyond the pages of the book and start talking in a general sense. Therersquos an election on the moment and Irsquom not opening my mouth. Itrsquos a few days before the Irish election when we meet. There are posters on every lamp post. The front page of Thehas splashedon a poll that suggests surging support for Sinn Fein. Doyle wonrsquot say who he will vote for or who others should vote for. ldquoIf somebody like myself said, lsquovote for this party,rsquo it would irritate the hell out of me.That said, scratch the surface and hersquoll talk more generally about the soon-to-be-ex Taoiseach , about the crisis of homelessness in Dublin and about the cityrsquos affordability ndash or lack of it ndash for the younger generations. All parties have embraced the need for more council housing, he points out.ldquoSome of them are saying people can then buy them, which will just restart the problem ,  years down the line. Therersquos an obsession with home ownership. Itrsquos not a Dublin problem. Itrsquos an Irish problem and it may go back to the land wars in the s and the famine.Still, unlike the UK, where Brexit was a vote led by the elderly, Ireland has seen younger generations direct the arguments over same sex marriage and abortion.ldquoIt will be interesting to seethey all come out this election. It could be the breakdown of the old system and the old notion that you havenrsquot truly become an adult until you own a house, which is probably unique in Europe to Britain and Ireland.ldquoI speak as a homeowner. I wonrsquot be giving it away. My kids can do what they want with it when Irsquom not around.Doylersquos writing le began before fatherhood . Itrsquos now more than  years since Doyle, then in his late twenties, wrote The Commitments. ldquoItrsquos  years since the film, he adds. ldquoHow do you measure  years  Itrsquos hard to accept that  is  years ago.\"I was just thinking today, my father died six years ago. Thatrsquos one-tenth of my le effectively and it doesnrsquot feel like that at all. It feels like last year perhaps, whereas something that happened in my childhood feels like where it should be, half a century away. The way we measure time changes as we get older, which is interesting as a facet of storytelling.I want to ask him about that -year-old teacher who wrote The Commitments, when he was known as \"PunkDoyle\". How punk were you, Roddy  ldquoNot particularly. I liked a lot of the music. I had a pair of Doc Martens and an earring.An earring in an Irish school  ldquoI took it out for the interview. I couldnrsquot lsquofindrsquo it that morning. Wore a suit. The dress code was quite casual.ldquoI loved The Clash and the Sex Pistols. Still do. But I was never a punk. Never close to being a punk. It just seemed another kind of unorm. I was called lsquoPunkrsquo in school because of the earring and the Doc Martens. That was it, really. There were other Doyles on the staff inevitably and one of them was called Dozy, so I was better off.When he sat down to write that first book, what was he reacting against  ldquoI wasnrsquot reacting against anything really. It was much more positive than that. It was much more joyousyou like. Therersquos an anger. Therersquos an energy. There always has been, always will be. Butthere is such a thing, it was a joyous anger. It was an appreciation of where I came from, what I had, and I think teaching gave me that.ldquoI was listening to the kids around me and remembering when this place was a field because it was more rural when I was a child. That would have been Paddy Clarke. I began to realise the spirit of the place and the energy of the place was there to be used. That was what I was picking up on when I wrote The Commitments.The Commitments and all of Doylersquos novels hum with the rhythm of Dublin speech. As a reader, I guess Irsquove grown up alongside Doyle. The twentysomething I was when I fell so avidly on those Barrytown novels was in my late forties when his short story collection Bullfighting appeared with its attendant intimations of middle age and mortality.Doyle writes what he knows. ldquoTo me it feels natural. This is the material that I have now. My father was , so hersquod led a good le, been healthy, good in his head right to the day before he died. So, grief announces itself in a way it hadnrsquot before. Irsquod had friends who had died, but this was a dferent one, this was your father.He wrote a play, Two Pints, that drew on this. ldquoI think itrsquos the best thing Irsquove written in many, many ways and also I could see it as some kind of tribute to my da.His new book Love which comes out in May sts through similar themes. Itrsquos about male friendships, middle age and dying parents. Doylersquos mother died while he was writing it. ldquoItrsquos bizarre becoming an orphan at the age of . And I think from a writing point of view itrsquos interesting. Itrsquos interesting getting older, mortality, slowing down, speeding up in some ways. Time, the things it does to you. The sense of redundancy when your children grow up and they donrsquot need you. Nobody wants to get older, but it is rich material for writing.ldquoLess and less people will read it. The book clubs are overwhelmingly women and they donrsquot want to read about ageing men. Ageing men want to read about Hitler and Stalin and football. They donrsquot want to read about themselves. But nevertheless hellipThe new book is essentially about a mid-le crisis. Is that a real thing  ldquoI donrsquot know, to be honest. I donrsquot know whatrsquos the extent of the crisis, in terms of how expensive the motorbike is or how long it lasts  How do measure a crisis You havenrsquot bought a motorbike  ldquoNo, but I know people who have. Itrsquos rusting in the back garden. Irsquom nearly  now, so whatever I do it wonrsquot be mid-anything. I didnrsquot go off to explore the world. I didnrsquot go to hellip What do you call it  Burning Man. So, maybe I missed an opportunity.Love is a novel about missed opportunities. Itrsquos dark and comic and sad and takes place mostly in Dublin pubs. There are a lot of pubs in it, Roddy. ldquoAnd, actually, a fraction of a fraction of the ones that could have been chosen.What is the appeal  \"Itrsquos hard to explain. Itrsquos the sense at certain times of dayof calm. The sense of it being slightly forbidden, which is great. It does good things for the self-respect. I really should be somewhere .\"Therersquos a pub near here I could sit in, and I mightnrsquot talk to anybody but I amlistening to the conversation. And theyrsquore looking at the race on the telly and I feel somehow involved, even though I donrsquot have skin in the game. Somehow I know thatI said something it would be answered and then yoursquore in.\"You say at one point that the pub is a ldquoshy manrsquos haven. Are you that shy man ldquoCould be, yeah. I can feel at home in a pub. Depends on the pub, depends on the time of day, but, yes, I could be that shy man. I suspect a man who isnrsquot shy couldnrsquot have come up with that line.ldquoI have very close friends, men I have known since I was a child and we meet regularly. I havenrsquot been in their houses in decades. We donrsquot do that. We go to the football and we meet in a pub and we have the autopsy in a pub and itrsquos like the football is the meat in a sandwich in a way.ldquoIf I didnrsquot drink,I was warned off the alcohol orI was an alcoholic this might be a very dferent conversation, but Irsquom not. Itrsquos a good question. Would I be comfortable in a pubIrsquod done damage to myself and drinking is dangerous  I suspect I probably could be. Luckily, I donrsquot have to.Love, as he has already said, is about two ageing men. Two ageing men talking, increasingly drunkenly, about their feelings. Are we as a gender getting better at that  ldquoI think maybe. I do know there are people who, when you are talking about a problem, get it and there are others ndash and itrsquos not just men ndash who root around in their memories and say, lsquoThis happened to someone ,rsquo asit is a card game. lsquoIrsquoll top your king with an ace.rsquoHisfather, he recalls, was fostered as a child. \"He was sent out of the house to a relationshouse miles and miles from where he lived. It was a huge family, he was the eldest.The pressure was on for space and money, I suspect. And He didnrsquotsee his mother for a year at least.\"I was trying to draw him out on it, but he was very reluctant to say that he was devastated.Very reluctant. He did say that an older cousin met him and realised he wasnrsquot happy and went to my grandmother and told her and that was the end of that, whereas I know myself,it had occurred to me, Irsquod make more of it.I would be more open about talking about it. So there are things like that that suggest we are better at talking about it, but itrsquos a huge generalisation.\"Your new book is called Love. Whatrsquos your definition of that word, Roddy  ldquoI donrsquot have one. Itrsquos such a vague word. I love coffee. I love my children. I love my we. I love Dublin. I love a bag of chips. And the word is perfectly accurate on all occasions. And it means entirely dferent things. So, I donrsquot really know.ldquoI wonrsquot be losing sleep trying to define love, but you have indicated that I am going to be answering that f****** question quite a lot in the next six months.We walk outside to take photographs. People walk past, look at him and walk on. Soon, he will get back on the bus to go home. He loves this city, he says. Not uncritically, but wholeheartedly.He might not be a writerhe hadnrsquot lived here, he says. Or at least hersquod be a very dferent one.

They warn many areas are now at ldquocrisis point.In an interview to be published in tomorrowrsquos Herald on Sunday, Mr Kerley said a wide-ranging review could help shape a sustainable future for local government.He said: ldquoI think it would be helpful to have another review of what we expect local government to do, and how we expect local government to do it.ldquoWhat is appropriate to charge for and not charge for  Because that makes a signicantdference in terms of the usage of facilities and services.He added: ldquoI donrsquot think it can be done by just saying, lsquoOkay, wersquoll increase this tax or that tax, or stop doing thatrsquo.The academic said the review could examine what services Scots expect councils to deliver, ldquoand how we might raise some of the money to do that, some of which could be raised locally, some of which would be raised through general taxation as it is now.He said it could involve representatives from all of Scotlandrsquos councils and the government ldquoand citizens as well.Mr Kerley, professor of management at Queen Margaret University, said: ldquoWersquove seen experiments in terms of the Citizens Assembly.You could incorporate something like that ndash plus people who have a particular interest.He said the current Citizensrsquo Assembly of Scotland, which brings together more than  people randomly recruited from across the country to discuss key issues facing it, has shown such an exercise is ldquoperfectly possible.In the years since devolution, there have been a number of reviews set up to consider local taxation.In , the Local Government Finance Review Committee proposed a ldquoradical alternative to council tax. Itrecommended a ldquonew progressive Local Property Tax... based on the capital value of inidual properties.Around a decade later, the Commission on Local Tax Reform recommended a programme of changes, including multiple forms of tax and a review of central grants.The Barclay Review into business rates in  also examined the role of local authorities.Mr Kerley said it is ldquoundisputed the proportion of central government spend that has gone to support local government over the past X years has been decreasing gradually compared to other areas of spend.It comes as Scotlandrsquos council leaders yesterday expressed disappointment that the agreed Budget deal only makes good the underfunding of new and existing commitments required by the Scottish Government and does nothing to address inflationary or demand pressures.It also fails to make any restoration of the signicant cuts to Local Government core funding in previous years.Leaders agreed that, as such, the settlement represents a  per cent or poundmillion cut in real terms in revenue funding for Local Government.Council Leaders instructed the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities to continue to lobby strongly for the additional % funding for inflationary pressures and % for restoration of previous funding cuts and for restoration of the poundm cut to the capital allocation.Mr Kerley said: ldquoThere clearly comes a point where councils have to say, as they have been saying for years, some of them, lsquowe canrsquot keep trimming a bit off here and a bit off there, and turning the lights off earlierrsquo and stuff like that.ldquoIn the longer term, you canrsquot provide for increased public services without increasing the flow of money into that ndash whether thatrsquos through taxation or charging, and wersquove generally resisted charging of ious kinds, though everywhere you look where councils are enabled to charge they are increasing the charges they are putting on things.ldquoAnd they are testing out, with for example musical tuition, whether they can charge for that. I think thatrsquos going to be an interesting test of legal commitment and legal powers and legal authority when it ndash as I think it will ndash goes into court in some shape or form.Mr Kerley said local authorities charging for services has always been ldquoa bit of a tangle, adding: ldquoWe charge for some things and we donrsquot charge for others. Some of them are statutorily protected in terms of charging. You canrsquot charge for lending library books,but you can charge for the lateof library books.ldquoYou charge for theatres, you charge for going into a swimming pool ndash how much you charge is a matter of what you need to raise and what you think people will pay.He said reforming council tax is ldquoone possibility, but added the ldquobig challenge for any government is the notion that you can, through a local property tax and indeed through income tax, make all of this additional money up through just affecting wealthy people or rich people...[it] just doesnrsquot hold.Councils argue funding provided by the Scottish Government is often ringfenced, funnelling extra cash directly into areas chosen by ministers, such as the expansion of free childcare.But Mr Kerley said the degree of ring-fencing ldquois considerably less than it was  or  years ago.He said: ldquoItrsquos reduced, but itrsquos now creeping back up again ndash I think most obviously with nursery education, because the huge commitment to, in a sense double, the amount of nursery education available for three and fouryear-olds meant councils had to create often purpose-built facilities or improve the ones they had, increase staffing and so on.

Deer numbers on the estate, part of Caenlochan Glen, increased by % between  and  from , to ,.The Scottish Government says deer population control in Scotland is a major issue, because the animals destroy forests that are needed in the fight against climate change, as are peatlandrsquos, which the deer can disturb.They are also estimated to cause , road accidents every year in Scotland. Earlier this year, a report ordered by the Scottish Government recommended thousands more deer be culled annually across the country to address the issue.Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland, the countryrsquos association representing hillwalkers, said: ldquoWe have major problems in Scotland with too many deer and the effect itrsquos having on the natural habitat.ldquoI think Caenlochan is the worst area for deer in Scotland and Balmoral is part of the problem.ldquoItrsquos time the Royal Family,they are serious about climate change, start reducing numbers of deer.Robbie Kernahan, director at Scottish Natural Heritage said: ldquoThe estates in the South Grampian and Caenlochan area, including Balmoral, have been working with SNH to reduce deer numbers.A SNH spokesman added: ldquoOur recent Deer Progress Report showed that while challenges remain, signicant progress has been made by landowners and managers.ldquoSNH leads a programme of work to promote sustainable deer management across Scotland, recognising the essential role it needs to play to help address climate change and bioersity loss.ldquoResearch shows deer numbers increased in Scotland from  to , but numbers have since stabilised because of increased culling, which is sometimes necessary to ensure healthy deer populations, reduce road traffic accidents and prevent signicant damage to our agriculture, forestry and nature.A Balmoral source said: ldquoRed deer are an iconic addition to Balmoral but there can be a clear conflict between deer culling and ensuring local forests are maintained around the estate.ldquoThe estate is doing itrsquos very best to ensure a balance is maintained and is working with relevant authorities to ensure this is achieved.A recent report has said up to one million wild deer, nearly double previous estimates, could be roaming the country, damaging the landscape and hampering environmental efforts.The findings, published by the Deer Working Group, is urging Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control deer numbers to protect their lucrative hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls.But landowners have criticised the recommendations, saying the report comes in sharp contrast to similar research by Scottish Natural Heritage published just two months earlier.The body that represents rural businesses and landowners, Scottish Land and Estates , also insisted conflicting evidence on the future of deer management in Scotland should not overshadow the recent progress achieved.It maintained the issue was not about overall deer numbers but about their impact on local areas.Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of the SLE, said: ldquoSubstantial progress has been made in the operation of deer management groups over the past five years, with the sector demonstrating its ability to respond and adapt to new challenges and manage deer in a way that is sustainable and safeguards public interests.\"Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay, Perthshire, have red deer densities above  per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between  and  per square kilometre. The report endorses SNHrsquos identication of the need for signicant changes in deer management as an important issue in climate crisis mitigation measures, and recommends that it is addressed as a priority. Conservationists argue that red deer, who often roam in vast herds, prevent woodland and shrubs from naturally regenerating.Ms Laing added: ldquoThe right density is also dependent on pasture availability rather than a strict number applicable across every region."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-large-inside-glasgows-anarchic-school-art","story":"Sometimes the tools required are more specic. For example, I happen to be walking through a certain studentrsquos workspace when I spot a pair of wind-up  teeth. The comedy kind, much favoured by agents of anarchy such as Dennis the Menace and the Bash Street Kids. The teeth havenrsquot been sneaked into the room for a giggle. Theyrsquore a vital part of the learning process. Though whatrsquos being learned here is how to be windswept and interesting.Irsquom on a tour of Glasgow School of Art, a place that is best described as a botanic garden for the hot-housing of bohemian types. If therersquos a box lying around some place, these guys want to think outside of it. On a matter of principle.In that context the chattering plastic teeth make a lot of sense. They are art. Or are waiting to become art. When your uninspired layman spots a cheap and tacky toy from a joke shop, he thinks to himself: ldquoOh, look. A cheap and tacky toy from a joke shop. But when an artist spots that self-same trinket, he or she starts to count the possibilities. And there are many. Those rattling teeth become a metaphor for the rictus grin of our dying society. Or perhaps they are tragically symbolic of the fake, plastic, disposable lives we are all forced to endure under the yoke of st century capitalism. So the plastic teeth are not just plastic teeth. They are a textbook, a laptop and a bunch of notepads, all rolled into one.Get creativeIt isnrsquot only the set of joke shop chompers that prove to be out of the ordinary on my tour of the Art School. Therersquos also some sort of metal, car-like machine that has been welded together from what seems to be rusty fragments of scrap iron. Elsewhere, a student has hung up a painted sign on which is scrawled the statement: lsquoMy worldrsquos on fire. How about yours rsquoPainted images paper the walls. Some are pretty striking.One image is a close-up view of flayed flesh. The kind of thing I imagine Hannibal Lecter might sketch in his spare time, in between snacking on human hotpot.Therersquos plenty more way-out and wacky work on display. Which is all to the good, as far as Irsquom concerned. If you canrsquot breach boundaries and tickle taboos when yoursquore a young, ambitious artist, when  can you do so  I actually feel very privileged to be strolling through the open minds of some seriously creative students. To grab a ringside seat as they blossom into badass. The Glasgow School of Art has a legendary alumni, after all. Robbie Coltrane. Muriel Gray. Fran Healy. Peter Capaldi. Some of them, just to be perverse, even become artists. My guides for the tour are Martha Stefani-Bose and Maja Tacchi, both in their third year at Glasgow School of Art, where they are also student ambassadors. Each Friday they take a group of prospective students round campus, to show them the delights contained within these walls of wit and way-out wonder. Members of the public arenrsquot invited on these guided tours, though Irsquove managed to sneak along using my Access All Areas Scotland Pass. Actually, I donrsquot really have such a pass. Irsquom just a pushy journo who manages to go places Irsquom not invited. One of the genuine would-be students on the tour is Sandra McWilliams, who was previously a successful accountant. She even had her own business for  years, but ultimately found it less than fulfilling. So she decided to get creative with her le.ldquoMy husband said to me, why donrsquot you seeyou can do something with art, she explains. ldquoSo I went to Clyde College to seethere was anything they could offer.Sandra was already adept at embroidery, crochet and knitting, which allowed her to be accepted for an HND in textiles. Now she wants to take the next step in her creative journey and is hoping to be offered a place at Glasgow School of Art, starting next year. ldquoMy eldest daughter came here to do a media course, she says. ldquoAnd I felt it was such a lovely community. I was always at home when I visited. I thought it was such a small and intimate setting.The tour has changed Sandrarsquos opinion, regarding the size of the school. ldquoItrsquos much bigger than I thought, she marvels. ldquoIt really is quite a layout.Ping pong tableIt is, indeed. People with only a passing knowledge of the school probably assume itrsquos essentially the ill-fated Mackintosh building, with a few minor buildings surrounding it. Not so.The Reid Building, for instance, which was completed in  and stands opposite the Mackintosh, is where our tour begins. It is a large, multi-floored, modernistic space, open plan and awash with light. Various disciplines are studied here, including textiles and printing. In many ways it could be any further education building. It has a canteen, rows of desks, computers. There are a few more unusual elements, however. Looms for the textile students to work on. And a print room that contains numerous shelves of small metal blocks with raised letters. Such things were once used by typesetters in newspaper offices, before digital technology replaced them. It seems that this archaic way of forming words still retains its appeal with the creatives of tomorrow.Painting and fine art is studied in a building that was formerly Stow College. Although this is the place for creativity with few boundariesitrsquos actually a rather brutalist environment. The corridors, grim and grey-walled, have the sort of chill feel that would be familiar to anyone who has visited an ancient swimming baths. At a push, I could be strolling down an endless passageway in KGB headquarters, circa  something-or-other, waiting nervously for a bullet from behind to finish me off. But then I peek into the artistsrsquo studios, and Irsquom hypnotised by a technicolour trance of anarchy turned into artice.No hierarchyI also visit the school of architecture, where everything is symmetrical, systematic and very well organised, as you would expect. Therersquos also a ping pong table, which you would not expect.Of course our group doesnrsquot get to visit the Mackintosh building, which was almost destroyed by fires in  and . An extensive restoration programme is still being attempted, and the entire edice is cloaked in a porcupine like framework of scaffolding. Itrsquos almost impossible to see what lurks beneath.ldquoThere could be a giant inflatable bouncy castle under there, for all anyone knows, I say to one of the guides, Martha Stefani-Bose, who was brought up in the west end of Glasgow and is studying painting and printmaking. ldquoNow that would be an artistic statement, she says drily.On a more serious note she adds: ldquoEveryone is mourning the loss of that amazing building. Obviously it was a work of art itself. But space-wise wersquore actually doing fine. It doesnrsquot seem cramped at all, and the new arrangements allow us to work even closer together, which really helps with the collaborative process.This collaborative process is one of the key selling points of Glasgow School of Art. ldquoTherersquos no hierarchy between disciplines, says Maja Tacchi, who is from Bristol and studies architecture.ldquoItrsquos an incredibly unique environment and wersquore lucky to be here. People from all dferent courses pull together and use their dferent areas of expertise to create new and interesting work. The art school really is a community of like-minded souls. It doesnrsquot matter what year yoursquore in, how old you are, where yoursquore from, or what yoursquore studying.

After initially being stunned at the accusations of guilt by vanishingly distant association, they tried to explain that Mr Sunakrsquos tweet was nothing to do with them and that they would never ldquointentionally stick ourselves in a Twitter storm, particularly late in the day when it was ldquonearly hometime.They also pointed out that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had posed similarly with their teabags in .

All education would be fee-paying, of course, with the most successful schools free to charge exorbitantly for their services.School departments might be sponsored by firms specialising in the appropriate disciplines. Thus, the science department with its partners Evonik, Pfizer and Biogen would be pleased to offer a suite of subjects tailored to meet the demands of a changing world. Maths would be brought to you by Tesla Inc and foreign languages would be the preserve of international airlines and holiday firms. English could be sponsored by Penguin, Harper Collins or Bloomsbury. Obviously, these firms would expect teachers to ensure their contracted authors featured heavily in their reading lists.Further down the scale, local firms might be invited to tender for subjects in those schools unable to compete financially with the elite FTSE establishments. These would be solid enough performers and might get your child into a half-decent polytechnic and a career as an army specialist.As well as league tables for exam results there would be something similar for teachers. This would operate like the draft system for US gridiron stars. Top schools would be prepared to pay huge salaries for teachers who can spin an A from a C- with the densest of materials.:Opinion Matrix: Power battles and realities of societyIn terms of discipline, parents would be expected to sign a sort of educational pre-nup. This would effectively permit a school to discipline a child as they saw fit and indemny teachers in the event of any physical or mental damage sustained by the child.As with all pure market-driven industries the dross would be quietly discarded. Children whose parents were unable to afford even the most basic fees would be taken to educational lsquofarmsrsquo where they would be given basic instruction on physical fitness and mechanical and household maintenance. Each year in these places there would be a Hunger Games type of competition where the prize could be a free education at one of the top schools. Those firms with an authentic sense of social mission at their core would bestow scholarships for the children of factory workers with long and unblemished service records.The overall effect achieved by such a system would be to ensure that power and wealth was retained within tight clusters of the right sort. Sounds ridiculous Well, in effect, itrsquos how Britainrsquos independent and fee-paying school system works. The essential alchemy at the heart of these places has little to do with achieving academic excellence and instilling lofty values. Bright pupils excelling at a fee-paying school would also have done so at a state establishment.Letrsquos be honest here their main attraction lies in masking the intellectual weaknesses of the less able offspring of rich families, thus sparing them having to work with common people who donrsquot just wear overalls for fishing. It also explains many of the catastrophic events in British military history some decisions taken in the run-up to the banking crisis and the tenure of the Bush family and Donald Trump in the White House.The results of a survey published this week found that more than a third of Edinburgh residents felt that a childrsquos social class had a material effect on their academic school performances. This compared with just % in Glasgow. The numbers are hardly surprising when you factor in how many children attend fee-paying schools in Edinburgh: currently around one in five and the highest percentage of such in the UK.:Herald Society heroes honoured for their work helping othersIrsquom not entirely sure that this suggests Edinburgh people are more class-conscious than in Glasgow or somehow more snobbish in their attitudes. Itrsquos simply confirmation of what most of us probably already knew: thatyou want to gain influence and wealth in modern Britain it helps greatlyyou attended one of these schools. It would be instructiveMy Tutor, the online tutoring service which conducted the survey, undertook also to ask people to what extent they felt that a childrsquos natural ability affected academic performance. Perhaps this is too dficult to measure.It certainly seems beyond the wit of any British or Scottish Government to attempt to do so. As things stand we assume that children born into challenging social circumstances must be of low academic ability. We judge them purely on exam results and fail to factor in the daily challenges of health inequality and multi-deprivation. We know that none can afford private tuition, the favourite means by which affluent but academically unremarkable children can tilt the playing field. The failure of British society to find more imaginative ways of unlocking the potential of poor children must cost this country billions every year in health and social security spending and crime prevention.Perhaps then they could borrow on the notion of pure, market-driven schools and customise them to meet the needs of the many rather than the few. Irsquod grant major global firms as well as local companies a suite of incentives to provide direct funding of local authority schools in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. They would have no influence on educational policy. As part of the deal they would also provide employment opportunities for pupils in these schools.Funding could range from meeting the salaries of extra teachers providing resource materials and paying for overseas trips. They would meet the cost of tutors for bright children and grant them meaningful internships, currently the exclusive preserve of affluent pupils whose parents have good professional connections.Boris Johnson talked about a process of ldquolevelling up to address regional inequalities in British society. I expect that to go the same way as Margaret Thatcherrsquos promise to bestow Franciscan kindness in .

Why now  Is Westminster, the mother of all parliaments, not enough  Her main opponent from within the party will be Angus Robertson, another erudite child of this city.And yet, eloquent and fluent as they both are, this will be a bruising contest. Cherry and Robertson are two of the brightest and best in the party, but there seems no love lost between them. The contest hasnrsquot even started yet ndash the window for further nominations is still open ndash and Robertson has already had a swipe at his party colleague about empire-building. She has ed this with interest amidst disguised references to Robertsonrsquos carelessness in losing his Moray seat to a Tory in .A state of civil stre quietly thrums beneath the surface of this most disciplined of political machines, and Cherry and Robertson are seen to be on either side of the fault-line. Allies of Cherry feel Robertsonrsquos fingerprints are all over some of the moves that have been made against her within the Westminster group over the last year or so.Cherry, currently the MP for Edinburgh South West, has become one of the most recognised parliamentarians at Westminster since she won her seat in , feared and admired in equal measure. She was instrumental in defeating Boris Johnsonrsquos plan to sabotage parliament late last year and is a formidable speaker from the floor of the House. This has caused jealousy among lesser-plumed party colleagues who have dutully toiled in the party for years without any recognition. ldquoShersquos just in the door five minutes, they say, ldquoand already shersquos coveting Nicolarsquos job. Thatrsquos the real reason why she wants to run for Holyrood.ldquoSo, do you really want the First Ministerrsquos job, I ask her.

Irsquom proud of her and of how well shersquos represented the cause of Scottish independence. I want to support her in leading Scotland to independence and in securing ourto the European Union. I certainly have my dferences with her, not least on her support for the proposed reforms of the Gender recognition Act, but more unites us than ides us.Ah yes, the Gender Recognition Act: never has something so scarcelyunderstoodby the vast majority of the general population caused so much turbulence within the gilded chambers of a political party. For those who inhabit the world outside cyberspace and the political bubble this is what it means. The Scottish Government wants to make it much easier for people to change their gender by enabling them to \"self-declare\"rather than endure a prolonged process. Cherry and other feminists within the SNP, most notably Joan McAlpine, convenor of Holyroodrsquos influential Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, have urged caution.Both women have endured abuse and intimidation from within the party for expressing concerns for womenrsquos sex-based rightsthe proposed GRA reforms come to pass. Cherry is careful to say that the abuse has come from ldquothe tiniest of factions who wield ldquodisproportionate influence.ldquoAs an out gay woman who fought section  and has campaigned for LGBT rights for decades, accusations that I am transphobic are offensive. The online abuse does take its toll but I am more worried about the cumulative and detrimental effect on what it does for the role of women in politics and in the media young women in particular. I donrsquot like the way this is characterised as a problem in the youth wing of the party.:MP Joanna Cherry: Scotland will be ignored at WestminsterldquoMany admirable young people are involved in Scottish politics and I know a number of women and men in Young Scots for Independence and SNP Youth who have spoken to me privately about their concerns. The abuse is deeply misogynistic. The attacks on me and other women in the party are clearly a breach of our code of conduct and must be dealt with.ldquoIrsquom very proud of the fact that in Scotland we have very good rights-based protections for trans people. No one is seeking to change that. However, women have legitimate concerns about the proposed changes to the law on gender recognition.Within the SNPrsquos Westminster group you sense she is admired rather than loved and therersquos not a little resentment at her high profile. One of her party colleagues at Holyrood has been aghast at her treatment at Westminster: ldquoShersquos a really sharp intellect, as forensic in her approach to politics as she was to the law. She does have what Burns called a guid conceit o hersel. This is admired and expected in male leaders, but women are held to a dferent standard and expected to show humility. She needs to build alliances though that is the clubby bit of politics which can evade hard-working women and allow mediocre men to advance.Cherry challenges my suggestion that the party could do without this contest in Edinburgh Central. ldquoCompetition in politics is healthy, she says. ldquoDebating ideas is good for developing policy. This isnrsquot being disloyal to the leadership. Holyrood and Westminster proceed by debate this is how we get to the nub of things.The fabled independence Plan B, which the party rejected last year, has ed for inspection now that Boris Johnson simply wonrsquot discuss a second independence referendum. This is another area where Cherry is perceived to be at odds with her boss. She rejects this.ldquoI wouldnrsquot back a wildcat or illegal referendum. How could I, given my legal background  I endorse Nicolarsquos declaration that this should proceed legally. However we have reached an impasse: people keep voting for us and opinion polls show support for Yes is hovering around %, yet Johnson wonrsquot budge.ldquoMy experience of knocking on doors is that there are lots of soft Nos who are interested in the idea of Scotland staying in the EU through independence. But we have to look at the economy and currency the process of getting back into the EU and how longrsquos it going to take. We must also deal with the border with England and de-dramatise it. The idea that people wonrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport is ludicrous. Wersquore all in the common travel area.\"Cherry is keen to stress that seeking a ruling from the Supreme Court on Holyroodrsquos competence to hold a referendum without Londonrsquos agreement does not amount to support for a wildcat vote.\"If we pass a bill through Holyrood to hold a referendum this might be challenged by the UK governmentrsquos law officer and then arrive at the Supreme Court. Any organisation could challenge it. Under section  of the Scotland Act within four weeks of a Bill passing the Advocate General, the Attorney General or the Scotlandrsquos Lord Advocate could choose to refer the question of the Billrsquos competence to the Supreme Court.ldquoIt would be for them to decide by a process of statutory interpretation whether this Bill was within the powers of Holyrood. Irsquod hope they wouldnrsquot just look at the Act but note the two countriesrsquo markedly dferent routes of travel and all the recent democratic votes in several political jurisdictions. If they said the Bill was within Holyroodrsquos competence wersquod have our referendum. Andnot I donrsquot think wersquod lose anything.Cherry would probably have been a judge by nowshersquod continued her legal career, with the prospect of earning much more money. She had a stellar career specialising in prosecuting sexual offence cases. Why did she choose this uncertain and venomous arena where party rules canrsquot prevent a woman from experiencing abuse and venom simply for adhering to long-held principles ldquoIf Irsquod known it would be like this I wouldnrsquot have stood for election, she says, ldquoand itrsquos sad that women might be put off entering politics because of it. And I donrsquot think Irsquove had the support I should have had through all of this.ldquoBut wersquore now at the end game for Scottish independence and the focus is on Holyrood.

Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families. While we might be seeing a bit more daylight at the moment, winter weather can often darken very quickly and lights on bikes are essential to ensure a child’s safety.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Elyza Fraser Mausoleum is one of the current NESPT projects\"  New directors appointed to local heritage trust board viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"therapy ponies bring joy to charity","story":"North East Sensory Servicesbrought together their young peoples and elderly user groups to share the benefits of interacting with the therapy ponies.Louise Burgess from Joyful Ponies said: \"The ponies seem to have a calming effect which is therapeutic for both children and adults.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void.

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"alliance proposal to stop flying union flag year round defeated","story":"The Union flag flies over Ards Council offices.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Union flag flies over Ards Council offices.Photo by Peter MorrisonBy Michael KenwoodFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAn Alliance proposal to stop the Union flag flying all year round at sites in Ards and North Down has been defeated.Flags policy in the area was due for renewal after the borough#s equality scheme#s five-year run ended this month.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at: co-founders.coThe deadline for applications for the North West programme is March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sixty minutes. Once the sliotar is thrown in, a game evaporates in a flash. Yet so much can happen. The helter-skelter of championship does that. For the camogs of Slaughtneil, they are just  minutes away from the upper echelons of club camogie. A passport to the very top of the tree. A fourth successive All-Ireland title would equal Buffers Alleys feat of the s. The Wexford club won the  title before losing the decider to Corks Killeagh the following but bounced back to annex the next four titles. googletag.cmd.push A Slaughtneil win on Sunday would also see them join Corks Glen Rovers on the roll of honour, who have four titles to their name, on the roll of honour. Standing in their way are Michael Hopper McGraths Sarsfields. The former All-Ireland winning forwards team, - which includes four of his daughters – must be sick of the sight of the Emmets at this stage. In Slaughtneils breakthrough year, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaisides player of the match performance saw her curl over the insurance point and supply the ammunition for Mary Kellys early second half goal to sink Sarsfields. The following year, snow stalled the road to glory and by time the game was fixed for Clones, Sarsfields had no answer to new attacking ace Tina Bradley, who rattled up a - tally, powering Slaughtneil to glory again. googletag.cmd.push Last year the landscape changed in the form of a new challenger emerging from the west. It was Ardrahan who took Sarsfields crown but they were edged out by the Derry giants, who defeated Mags DArcys St Martins in a Croker snowstorm to complete three-in-row. Slaughtneils four-year unbeaten run came a cropper in the league last summer at the hands of neighbours Swatragh at Davitt Park. By the time the championship rolled into town, normal service resumed. After a semi-final win over the Davitts, they slugged it out with Ballinascreen before retaining their title. From their first All-Ireland winning team of , five players have moved on. Denise McGuigan retired with two All-Ireland medals in her collection. Her cousin Dervlagh had the sameby the time she jetted off for a teaching career in Dubai. Mary Kelly moved to Glasgow after the first title, also to start a new job. This season, manager Damien McEldowney had to plan without defensive duo, sisters Eiliacutes and Broacutena Niacute Chaiside who opted to go travelling. Into the defence came Eiliacutes McGrath to cement a place and there was afor Clare McGrath, who missed out of the  after having a baby.    players in line for a fourth All-Ireland final starting berth:Jolene BradleyJosine McMullanGraacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinAoe Niacute ChaisideTherese MellonSinead MellonLouise DouganSiobhaacuten BradleyShannon Graham.  After a season at midfield, Faoiltiarna Burke opted out of the  and Cliona Mulholland has slotted into the vacancy. Mary Kellys shoes were filled by Tina Bradley. Josine McMullan had originally moved from corner back but was converted into a ball winner at full-forward. She lost her place for the Loughgiel game to Olivia Rafferty before a recall for the All-Ireland semi-final. If McEldowney and his selectors retain the same starting line-up, it will see nine players start all four All-Ireland finals. Slaughtneil and their highly-respected physio Moira-Jane Devlin will have been thankful of the five week play-off since their win over Scarf-Ogonnelloe. Shannon Graham was forced off with an ankle ligament injury, but manager Damien McEldowney is confident she will be available for selection. CHANGES As the Emmets peek out west, there are changes in the Sarsfields camp from the previous encounters. Yvonne Lyons has been replaced by current Galway club all-star keeper Laura Glynn between the posts. Sinead Cannon has moved from attack to corner back in place of cruciate ligament victim Rachel Murphy. In the other corner is former midfielder Kate Gallagher. There have been changes to their half-back unit. Erica Leslie picked up a hip injury that kept her out of the - to - county final win over St Thomas. She ed for the All-Ireland semi-final. So too did Maria Cooney. She had her foot in a cast for six weeks following a broken ankle sustained in the second half of their win over St Thomas. Tara Kenny tore her cruciate ligament before Galways All-Ireland final win over Kilkenny in September. Sarsfields only starter on the winning side was Sarah Spellman and she wasnt without injuries woes, having to get over a broken thumb to play her part in their - to - victory over St Vincents. The five-week break will have given Leslie, Cooney and Spellman every chance of making full recoveries, which will be a welcome boost as Hopper ponders who picks up Tina Bradley. His daughters Clodagh and Niamh – who picked up a hamstring injury in the  final – line out in the midfield zone, with Orlaith and Siobhaacuten forming the spine of their attack. There has been an injection of youth to their squad. Rachel Murray, who played Sarsfields last All-Ireland final appearance, Cora Kenny who was on water bottle duties in Clones that day and Joanne Daly were all part of last years Galway minor team. Another newcomer is Aoibhe Deeley who has mixed underage camogie with a career in athletics, where she specialises in the hurdles. Slaughtneils defence will be thoroughly tested. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will be the favourite to pick up Siobhaacuten McGrath. Ceacuteat McEldowney could go onto Rachel Murray, with Eiliacutes McGrath assigned to Cora Kenny, who scored the match-winning goal in their extra-time win over Mullagh in the Galway semi-final. It is in the midfield area where the game will hinge. Slaughtneil had a tough physical battle with Scarf-Ogonnelloe, like they did with Thomastown in . Back then, it served them well. Clare McGrath, Bridiacuten McAllister and Aoe Niacute Chaiside will have a huge to roll to play across the half-back line, with Shannon Graham getting back to full power after injury. They also have their quarter-back, Louise Dougan back in the sweeping role but in her absence from attack puts a huge emphasis on the movement of Therese and Sinead Mellon to provide the link in the half-forward ision. Eight-time winners St Pauls Kilkenny , St Lachtains Kilkenny and Pearses Galway accompany Slaughtneil in the three-in-row club. The Emmets have made a habit of breaking records and who would bet against the Bill and Agnes Carroll Cup making another foray up the Halfgain Road on Sunday night. VERDICT: SLAUGHTNEIL PROBABLE TEAMS SLAUGHTNEIL: Jolene Bradley Ceacuteat McEldowney, Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein, Eiliacutes McGrath Bridiacuten McAllister, Aoe Niacute Chaiside, Clare McGrath Shannon Graham, Cliona Mulholland, Siobhaacuten Bradley, Tina Bradley, Louise Dougan, Josie McMullan, Sinead Mellon, Therese Mellon. SARSFIELDS: Laura Glynn, Sinead Cannon, Laura Ward, Kate Gallagher, Erica Leslie, Maria Cooney, Joanne Daly, Aoibhe Deeley, Niamh McGrath, Clodagh McGrath, Orlaith McGrath, Sarah Spellman, Cora Kenny, Siobhaacuten McGrath, Rachel Murray. KEY BATTLE Siobhaacuten McGrath v Graacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinIn Sarsfields last three championship games, Siobhaacuten McGrath has amassed - of her teams combined tally of -. While man come from placed balls, it is her all round play that makes her the pivot of their All-Ireland challenger. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will need the help of her midfield to limit the supply butshe can at least break even in her duel with McGrath, it could tip the scales in Slaughtneils favour.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but

roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District.

Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath.

Some politicians began to converge on a stupid solution: privatising MOT tests to save public cash.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...If that happened, then instead of going to government-run test centres, a car owner would go to a garage to get the road worthiness tests done, as happens in England and Wales. It is a very bad idea.It would be privatising a sphere of public le where we should instead keep out any hint of profit.Inevitably, garages that issue MOT certicates have a vested financial interest in telling vehicle owners they need to get work done.Most car owners, like most computer owners or most homeowners,know nothing about the mechanics of cars . So when they are told something needs to be done to their carand that it will cost £X, they can only stand blinking at the person who is telling them so, because they do not have the expertise to know better.In Great Britain there are said to be safeguards against this commercial incentive on the part of MOT garages to tell you that you need work done . I make two observations in response. The first is an anecdote. The only time I needed an MOT in England, in the s, I was told by an MOT approved garage in north London that I needed to spend hundreds of pounds on something that, in the end, after further research, I didn’t need done at all.The second is a startling statistic that this newspaper carried on the front page some years ago.In Great Britain, where cars were then first testedafter three years on road that initial MOT was failed by .% of cars.In Northern Ireland, where cars are first tested after four years, the initial failure rate was a mere .%.Cars in the Province had a far higher pass rate than newer cars in Great Britain, despite the NI cars having a full extra year of usage and wear and tear than the GB ones.Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, told the News Letter: “This clearly shows there is something wrong with the system in Great Britain. It is failing cars at three years old that should be passed. The suspicion is that it is to get garages business.“The system is supposed to be tightly controlled, but there are still legions of stories about people going to a garage and feeling that they have been ripped off.”It would be madness to introduce that system into NI, replacing our rigorously impartial system, but some voices are calling for it due to the current MOT delays. Stormont, which loves easy solutions, could axe our MOT centres.For many years I have driven old but quality cars, including a Toyota and Honda. I find it a cost effective way to run a reliable car.Some years ago, I asked an NI garage near where I then worked to tell me what it needed for MOT. They said it needed A, B, C, D, E done, cost £. I didn’t have time to get a second opinion, said fine, and booked it in. But before I got the work done I was driving past a garage in Co Down that specialised in some of the things I was told I needed, so I stopped and said: “I’m due MOT, I think the car is OK butyou could just check A, B, C, D, E.” The garage said A. B and C need done, not D and E. The estimated bill for the work plummeted. Baffled, I went to a trye-brake outfit and asked them to assess A, B, C. They said only A, B need done. The total bill was only £, not £, so I cancelled the booking at the first garage, got the basic work done, booked an MOT, and passed.This is not to imply that garages are fraudulent. They might, for example, be doing what sales folk call ‘selling up’ and advising you to get work done earlier than needed.But getting second quotations is too time consuming, so latterly prior to an MOT I have just fixed basics – tyres, lights and brakes— then put the car through to seeit passes.The vehicle is being assessed by an impartial adjudicator who has no vested interest in telling you whether or not it is roadworthy. If it fails thenyou pay a re-test fee, which helps fund the system.It is a good system, that we should keep.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There will be an internal UK border in the Irish Sea, whatever Michael Gove says"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop it entirely misleading imply any defiance church ireland marriage stance ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionColumnistsBishop: It is entirely misleading to imply any defiance of the Church of Ireland marriage stanceWith regard to your headline and front page story on same-sex marriage and the position of the Church of Ireland .By Dr Kenneth KearonFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"Comment was made in the context of a response to an Northern Ireland Office consultation on same-sex religious marriage‘Same-sex marriage: Church of Ireland body declares gay people should be able to wed’I would repeat the information provided to your journalist, verbatim.This was made in the context of a response to the Northern Ireland Office’s consultation on same-sex religious marriage and conversion entitlements:Letter to the editor \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

But in a ided society such as Northern Ireland, with history pointing to the clear potential for discrimination, recrimination and violence, it is more dficult still for those in favour of Irish unity to win the argument – even at a time when the old Protestant majority is vanishing.Although polling evidence is contradictory – with Belfast firm Lucid Talk’s polls consistently suggesting higher levels of support for Irish unity than most other polls – next week polling will be released which for several reasons will make grim reading for republicans.Even after all the turmoil of Brexit, of three years without devolved government, of the cash for ash scandal, of the distrusted Boris Johnson as prime minister, there is scant evidence of the sort of surge in support for Irish unity which would be necessary to win a border poll.This week a group of senior academics headed by The Constitution Unit at University College London but encompassing professors in Belfast, Dublin and the US came to Belfast to take evidence about how any future border poll would work.A separate academic team at another English university is working on another signicant project examining related questions.The very fact that more than  years after the Belfast Agreement basic questions around the practicalities of a border poll have not been resolved – or in many cases even asked – implicitly points to a failure of Sinn Féin.The party which has Irish reunication as its central goal and which now accepts that the only way that can happen is by winning a border poll has put far less energy into resolving how that could happen than it has into the sort of political disputes and manoeuvringwhich have brought it to electoral dominance within nationalism.Belatedly, republicans now appear to be adopting some of the tactics of Brexiteers ahead of the EU Referendum. Just as Brexiteers, realising that Ukip were toxic to many voters, set up surrogate organisations – from ‘Business for Britain’ to ‘Students for Britain’ – to carry their message to otherwise unreachable groups, soseveral republican groups which are not publicly linked to Sinn Féin have now sprung up.Those groups have been more effective than the party at stimulating debate and encouraging some unionists to engage in that debate.Nevertheless, even those groups have made limited progress in persuading those who do not instinctively want a united Ireland – or a ‘new Ireland’, as it is now branded – of the imperative for that to happen.While the Secretary of State retains a discretionary power to call a border poll at any time the mandatory trigger for him to have to call a referendum remains opaque.\u2028The  Agreement states that“ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK”, then he must call a referendum.The Agreement is not prescriptive on the criteria to be taken into account when deciding on the issue.Five weeks before the Brexit vote I hypothetically asked the then Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, whether she would take an overall majority for nationalism at Stormont or opinion polls as an indication of support for a united Ireland. She said vaguely that the NIO would consider “all the relevant facts”.If such a poll was called, it is unclear what roles the British and Irish governments would or could play. Some people believe both governments should be neutral.But how could the Irish government be neutral when it is not only constitutionally obliged to support Irish unity, but would also be the only body which could make credible promises to voters as to what a vote for unity would entail Central to any successfulIrish unity campaign would almost certainly be a clear plan – or at least a sufficiently convincing one – as to what would happen after such a vote.An agreed plan – akin to the Scottish government’s document prior to the  independence referendum –would make it harder for unionism to make the argument that, as with Brexit, people would be voting to end the current constitutional clarity and enter a period of uncertainty. Some republicans believe that unionists will come on board to discuss what should be in that proposal.While there will be exceptions who prove the rule, there is little evidence of unionists willing to assist with such a process – as distinct from taking part in discussions where they argue the unionist case.In fact, it would be profoundly illogical for unionists to help with something which would make the end of the Union easier – unless they believed that they would inevitably lose such a plebiscite, which is not a commonly held view.Unionists working on a plan to build a united Ireland would be the equivalent of republicans working on a plan to make the Union more attractive – it would be antithetical to their ideological interests.Any signicant body of unionists being involved in such a process only seems realisticthey have lost a border poll, meaning that until that point the onus is on nationalists to present an attractive proposition which will persuade voters.As a Sinn Féin member this week admitted, with unusual candour, to the BBC, the sort of ‘up the Ra’ comments and other triumphalist episodes which marked Sinn Féin’s recent southern electoral success do nothing to persuade unionists that they are serious about the ‘new Ireland’ rhetoric.Some people believe that ‘citizens’ assemblies’ – a trendy attempt to circumvent seemingly intractable political problems – could bring ordinary unionists on board eventheir leaders refused.But aside from the dficulties of such a process being infected by either conscious or unconsciousbias, the legitimacy of citizens’ assemblies rests on the argument of their proponents that those selected to sit on them are chosen randomly, making them at least quasi-democratic.If ordinary unionists refused to participate, such bodies would not be remotely representative.Thus far there is signicant reason to believethat the scale of change is less decisive that eitherthose unionists who despair the Union is over would fear or those nationalists who believe Irish unity is inevitable now hope to be the case.What happens next will be shaped by the decisions of those who lead unionism and nationalism, as well as by global social and economic forces far beyond their control.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On February , , her then boyfriend of two years David sat down at home to watch the TV coverage of his beloved Northern Ireland play at their home ground of Windsor Park.What happened at half time was certainly something he wasn’t expecting. For there, right in the middle of the pitch, cheered on by delighted fans, was Lisa, standing with a huge banner which spelled out the six words that were to change his le forever: David Houston, will you marry me Joanne Palmer and her husband IanThankfully David said yes and the pair, who live in Claudy, tied the knot in October , a year and a half after the Leap Day proposal. Eight years on, Lisa, , and David, , are as happy as ever and now the proud parents of three sons, George, , Elliot, , and Henry, . Lisa, who works in a nursing home in Omagh, said the idea of taking matrimonial matters into her own hands was quite a random one.“David’s friends had tickets to a Northern Ireland game, but he said he couldn’t be bothered going, so I said I’d like to go as I had never been to a football match.“I asked him what date it was on, and when he said February , I said, are you sure you want me to go ’ But he was so busy watching the Super Sunday game that he didn’t even take me on.”Lisa then got in touch with the Irish Football Association to seethey would allow her to ask Sky TV to point their cameras at her during the match so she could hold up her proposal. But Sky told her that she would need to actually come on to the pitch. The first half of the match passed without a single goal, which didn’t help Lisa’s nerves. Then, when the whistle blew, she made her way onto the pitch, helped by a couple of David’s friends, and unveiled the five foot banner, which she had ordered online, proclaiming the question of all questions.“It was the longest five minutes of my le waiting for the phone to ring to hear a yes, ” she recalled..“Finally he rang and said, what are you at ’, and I said, well ’. He said yes, and I shouted his answer to the crowd and got a massive cheer. It was hilarious.’’Looking back on that momentous day, Lisa admitted she doesn’t knowshe would have the guts to do it now. ‘‘David and me talk about it sometimes and I thinkI was to do it now, I’d be more nervous. But David would say that he is still chuffed to bits to this day that I did it - it was a brave thing to do and it was a nice thing that happened to him.’’And he even received a signed Northern Ireland shirt as a result of his then girlfriend’s plucky proposal.Lisa’s advice to other women contemplating the big question today is simple - ‘go for it’. ‘‘If you’ve found the person you want to spend the rest of your le with, it doesn’t really matter who asks who. Andyou don’t you’ll have to wait another four years.’’The tradition of women proposing on leap day is thought to date back to th-century Ireland when St Bridget complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for suitors to propose.He then gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month.Legend has it that Brigid then dropped to a knee and proposed to Patrick that instant, but he refused, kissing her on the cheek and offering a silk gown to soften the blow.Others believe the tradition originates from Scotland when Queen Margaret, then aged just five, declared in  that a woman could propose to any man she liked on February .Another woman who decided to do the asking was Joanne Palmer, , from Ballykelly, Co Londonderry.In  Joanne was working at Butlins in Minehead, Somerset. A week into her job as deputy manager of the nursery, the then -year-old met Ian, , who was on holidays at the resort with his friends. Joanne recalled: ‘‘We were in one of the nightclubs in Butlins and his friend was trying to chat me up, but I kept looking at Ian and he kept looking at me. The next night after that we met and got chatting ourselves. So, it was a holiday romance at the beginning.’’After Ian ed home to Cornwall, the lovestruck pair maintained their romance writing letters to each other and chatting on the phone. A year later Ian also got a job at Butlins and that, said Joanne, was when they ‘‘started getting serious’’ about each other. Joanne was ‘‘madly in love’’ with ‘‘tall, blonde’’ Ian and decided she wanted to marry him. ‘‘I think we both knew that we were going to be together, It just felt right.‘‘I remember reading Leap Year Day was the day women could propose and I have to say that he was the nearest thing to perfect that I had ever met.’’Butlins had closed for February, but the lovebirds stayed on, Joanne working as a chalet maid and Ian doing security. Joanne, a self-confessed terrible cook, decided to sweeten the proposal by baking a cake on her ‘wee two-ring cooker’’ in her room. She added: ‘‘I had bought a ring in Minehead that cost £, just so that I could put it onhe said yes.’’Prior to the big question, Joanne admits she felt anxious. ‘‘I am quite a confident person, but I was really, really nervous that day.‘‘He came in and sat down and I got down on one knee and I said ‘Ian, will you marry me ’ and I lted out the cake and he said ‘you, didn’t bake that’ and then he said ‘yes’.A few months later the pair came back to Northern Ireland for a holiday,‘‘Ian said he wanted topropose to me, but he wanted to do things right,’’ said Joanne, ‘‘so he took my dad to one side and asked himhe could have permission to marry his daughter. Really old-fashioned. And then in front of all my cousins and aunts and uncles, he proposed then.’’Ian and Joanne got married on January , , now have two children, Bradley, , and Abigail, , and have just celebrated our th wedding anniversary.Joanne said: ‘‘Every leap year day I wonder who  is doing it.’’Her advice to other women contemplating a proposal is this: ‘‘If you are going to do it, it has to be that person who is dferent than anybody  you have ever met, you have to have that feeling that this is the person you want to spend the rest of your le with. It’s very serious.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience.

Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
