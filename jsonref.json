I just went about my day. I didn\u0027t see anyone, I never cheated on Kate.\u0027Jon says it didn\u0027t help that long after he had separated from Kate and paparazzi shots emerged of him dating other women, the show, which was filmed six months in advance, showed him still married.\u0027Knowing what I know now, it was a smear campaign,\u0027 he said.\u0027I was gagged, my paycheck was cut off and they (TLC) needed an excuse why I left the show.\u0027They also needed to come up with a story line to garner the ratings, they wanted me to be the most hated person in America.\u0027Ten years on and Jon is very much out of the limelight.He says he is loving life in Reading, where he lives with daughter Hannah and son Collin, as well as his girlfriend, Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner Colleen Conrad and her daughter Jordan. "},{"url":null,"title":"Nevada desert towns prep possible Storm Area 51 influx","story":"Share this articleOfficials ready for whatever comes from Area 51 raid events —VIDEO | Las Vegas Review-Journal"},{"url":null,"title":"Dwyane Wade Gabrielle Unions six bedroom Biscayne Bay Estate listed 32 5M","story":"Share this article          What\u0027s cooking?

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Further up the river, Westminster is shutting down for five weeks. Ever since Boris Johnson raised the prospect of proroguing parliament, people have been sharing a quote from The Handmaid’s Tale, published 35 years ago, just as they did in the US following the election of Donald Trump in 2016: “That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn’t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed at home at night, watching television.”“It is another predictable mess that people have got drawn into because a big honking pack of lies was told about it,” Atwood says of Brexit. Apart from the legal questions – “actions have consequences, but what will the consequences be?” – she is most interested in “who is going to benefit from this financially? Who is shorting the pound? I can think of all kinds of people who might turn it to their advantage.”As has been noted, the last time a novel received such a fanfare was the midnight launches for Harry Potter books – with fans sporting specs and scarves instead of capes and bonnets. Atwood is our high sorceress, a very grownup one, with a truly unnerving knack for auspicious timing. Her best work combines psychological acuity with audacious curiosity she is as good at recreating the politics of the playground (Cat’s Eye, 1989) as she is at inventing a chillingly plausible male theocracy. She is both deadly serious and surprisingly playful, and it is to her that readers have turned as a way of making sense of the world, helped by the hugely successful TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. With cameo appearances as an Aunt, and another in the TV version of her 1996 novel Alias Grace, which also aired in 2017, she describes the last couple of years as “horrible fun: when the occasion for the fun is not so happy. And the occasion for the fun is the rise of religious fundamentalist actions against women”.Like Kafka and Orwell, Atwood has become part of the public discourse the red and white robes adopted as a symbol of female defiance from Ireland to Argentina, but most often in the US, where her near-future dystopia, in which women have been reduced to female reproductive slaves, was set. Yet back in 1985, when The Handmaid’s Tale, Atwood’s sixth novel, was published, “a big fuss was not particularly made. I think we had some sort of publisher’s party,” she says dryly.The sequel has been surrounded by levels of secrecy to rival any ex-prime minister’s memoir, with tales of Booker judges’ computers being hacked (The Testaments is on this year’s shortlist). “I left my computer on a plane,” she confides. “I forgot about it because I was watching Captain Underpants.” She didn’t have a copy of The Testaments on it, but there was enough information to cause a stir if it fell into the wrong hands. Atwood doesn’t – yet – have the powers to ground a plane, but she was reunited with her computer within two hours. “It would have been a catastrophe,” she says, laughing now.Then Amazon blew it all by sending out copies in the US a week ahead of publication. “Somebody pushed the wrong button. It was human error,” she says unruffled. “They apologised, which is apparently among the first times, if not the first time, that Amazon have ever apologised.”Despite her formidable energy, Atwood embodies an owl-like stillness – head tilted, listening carefully, with only her hands moving when she speaks. She gives long, far-ranging answers (not always to the question asked), and can leap from Mary Queen of Scots to Mary Poppins, or from the Cromwells to the day’s news, in the blink of a gimlet eye. At nearly 80, what does she make of this remarkable late boost? “Isn’t it wild,” she says. “I can’t remember a time when I was a usual anything,” she says. “I mean going way back. I didn’t grow up in a usual way” (her childhood was spent in the Canadian wilderness). “I wasn’t a usual kind of high-school student. I was a very peculiar university student and it continued on from there.” Atwood “became” a writer at 16, when she made up a poem in her head while crossing a football field. Since then she has written more than 60 books, in almost every genre, and has been awarded more than 100 prizes, including the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. Her futuristic trilogy – Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013) – has an ardent following. She lives in Toronto, spending her summers on Pelee Island, where she has written many of her novels, including much of The Testaments (as well as a stint, more surprisingly, in Norwich).The author has just had a long chat with Bruce Miller, the TV series’ showrunner, who is “quite thrilled” about the new novel, “because it gives him a lot more to work with”. Atwood, an executive producer on the show, had started writing The Testaments before the first season launched. And there shouldn’t be any clashes, as her sequel picks up 15 years later: “We know where we start in the 15 years, but there’s quite a lot of squeezing room for things that happen leading up to that,” the author explains. “I’ve given him a lot of blank space that will be his to fill. We agreed he can’t kill off certain people a long time ago.”“Hands off Aunt Lydia” and “don’t touch that baby” were her principal stipulations. “I needed this child here and that child there – so that’s how it’s going to be.” The Testaments is narrated by three voices: it is the last will and testament of Aunt Lydia, and the testimonies of two girls, Agnes who has grown up in Gilead, and Daisy who escaped to Canada with her mother as a baby. Atwood’s reluctance to write as Offred, the narrator of The Handmaid’s Tale, was one of the reasons it took her so long to attempt a sequel, despite “the clamouring” from readers. “I couldn’t do it,” she says emphatically. “Not possible. To recreate that voice and do more of it. I just couldn’t.” She is wary of follow-ups in general. “They are always kind of imitations. I saw Mary Poppins Returns. A commendable sequel. I enjoyed it, but it’s not the same.”Atwood has said in the past that The Handmaid’s Tale was written to answer the question: if there was a totalitarian regime in the US what form would it take? The Testaments sets out to show how such a regime collapses: “What makes them turn into something else? What makes them fall apart?” And for that she needed an insider: “So who in that whole cast of characters is going to know more? There’s only one answer to that.” Aunt Lydia, a female Thomas Cromwell, “swollen with power” but without absolute authority.Many readers have wondered what they might do in Offred’s situation, how to resist and survive by giving us Aunt Lydia’s story, Atwood asks us to think about questions of cruelty and complicity. All her novels are about survival. As Aunt Lydia reflects: “What good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot? ... Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.” Or as Atwood puts it: “We are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.” She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: ‘“Pray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.’ You don’t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there’s a burning building … Similarly, you don’t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there’s a burning building.”But the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. “For a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.” The Handmaid’s Tale, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. “They just didn’t have the power to make that happen.” Now they do.The novel’s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings – the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In The Testaments Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged “her vanished country”, before continuing. “People became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don’t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.”If the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. “It always does, because women and children are weaker – let’s take their stuff,” she says. But, as Atwood points out, she “did climate apocalypse quite thoroughly” in the MaddAddam trilogy. “Maybe not thoroughly enough,” she says, “because I think it is actually going to be worse.” But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would “absolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion”. She was the first writer to donate a manuscript to the Future Library, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway.At an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. “Vital,” she fired back. “This is a hinge moment, in many different ways,” she says now. “Let’s call it the casket moment,” an allusion to the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice. “One of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, ‘All right human race, which door are you going to open?’”One of Atwood’s central axioms is that nothing can be included in her fiction that hadn’t happened somewhere in the world. As Atwood has reminded us: she didn’t make this stuff up, the human race did. “If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,” she wrote in a recent introduction to The Handmaid’s Tale. And this is “absolutely” the case for The Testaments: shadows of Weinstein and Epstein, Isis and the Trump administration can all be found in its murky waters. It is impossible to read the scenes set in a female detention camp without thinking of the US-Mexico border.Is Atwood firing a warning or reflecting what is already happening? “Both. But warnings aren’t effective if they are just preaching. Enactments are of interest because then people think ‘What would I do?’ Whereas if someone is going ‘Don’t do that, don’t do that,’” she says, wagging her finger. “You think ‘Oh shut up!’”This is the sixth time Atwood has been shortlisted for the Booker prize. “There are upsides and downsides” to winning, she says. If you win everyone says you shouldn’t have won the Booker. And if you don’t win, in Canada anyway, they say ‘Atwood fails to win Booker’.” And then there is the Nobel. “Oh purlease …” She is already at work on a collection of poetry, often her way of working up to a novel. And she hasn’t ruled out a further instalment: “Never say never to anything.”“Only dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive”: so Aunt Lydia opens The Testaments. Is there an Atwood statue? “There’s a head,” she laughs. “We used to call it the horrible head.” The plaster cast is in her cellar, the original, made in the 70s, at McMaster University. “I don’t look like that,” she told the sculptor, who replied. “But you will …”“People bang on about your legacy,” she says, impatiently. “I’m not that interested because I’m not going to be here. I’m not going to be around haunting my legacy. Unless I do an Aunt Lydia and bury little manuscripts in libraries.” Well, there’s already that story buried away in the Future Library. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e306790a4a3dd87838b7a92a8da68376a82646/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88278e48c30bd5058878a3b85d173447","title":"have you been affected by the closure of pawnbroker albemarle bond","story":"We’d like to hear from staff and customers who have been affected by Albemarle \u0026amp Bond shutting its shops.

Ray Perry, NPA chief executive, said there were only 10 people working in Albemarle \u0026amp Bond’s contact centre and they had been overwhelmed by demands for information. A statement on the company’s website said that it would transfer all existing accounts to its pawnbroking centre and would not sell any items without first speaking to customers. We’d like to hear from from both staff and customers affected by the closure of the pawnbroker’s shops. If you’re a client, have you managed to retrieve any items or are you having difficulty communicating with the company via its hotline or by email?

It is also offering to rebook thousands of cancelled passengers.The airline emailed passengers on 12 September to confirm cancellations, just before a 14-day notice period when it would have been liable for additional compensation payments under EU regulation.A BA spokeswoman said: “We are offering all customers whose flights were cancelled due to next week’s planned industrial action the option to rebook on to a British Airways flight, with a schedule of services to our daily destinations on 26, 27 and 28 September.”Passengers whose travel was cancelled and who were refunded can rebook at their original fare, and those rebooked on to other carriers by BA may also have the option to return to one of its services if available.However, passengers who booked their own alternative travel will not be refunded if they choose to fly with BA after all.Pilots walked out for two days this month, costing the airline an estimated £40m a day after all but five daily flights were cancelled.The British Airline Pilots’ Association announced on Wednesday that it had called off the 27 September strike, saying it was “time for a period of reflection before the dispute escalates further and irreparable damage is done to the brand”.The union has called for “meaningful new negotiations”, although BA has said it is only available for talks without preconditions in the long-running pay dispute. Balpa has a mandate for industrial action until January and said it could announce further strike dates.Meanwhile, UK pilots at Ryanair have called off five days of strikes scheduled over the next nine days – on 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 September – after failing to affect operations in three days of walkouts this week. Balpa said it was “taking the moral high ground” in ending the strikes, although it said relations were “acrimonious”. The union said: “Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by withdrawing their travel benefits.”It did not rule out setting new strike dates if talks did not take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f17474ad99f90c2c86fcc0b30411c5bd8e3e24/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5330021bbd7bffef69c34361ad6178a5","title":"the men who plundered europe city of london practices on trial in bonn","story":"Billions of euros in EU taxpayers’ money was siphoned in ‘cum-ex’ scandalThey have been called “the men who plundered Europe”: a group of cowboy traders, seasoned tax lawyers and mathematical whizz kids who are alleged to have conspired in the heart of the City of London to siphon at least €60bn in taxpayers’ money from the state coffers of several EU countries.In Britain, the so-called “cum-ex” scandal, named after the complex derivatives juggling act employed, gained little attention amid the frenzied debate around the UK’s departure from the European Union when the fraud scheme was discovered in 2017.But in continental Europe what Le Monde has described as the “robbery of the century” has done almost as much to shape the view of Britain as Brexit itself, with Dutch media calling it “organised crime in pinstripe suits” and one of the original German whistleblowers saying he now welcomes Britain’s exit from the EU in the hope it could weaken the influence of London investment banking on European financial institutions.This week, a British former investment banker involved in developing the scheme for the first time gave the public an insight into how the scheme worked and what spurred on its architects.Speaking at a regional court in Bonn, where two ex-bankers are on trial for 34 instances of serious tax fraud between 2006 and 2011, County Down-born Martin Shields painted a picture of a London banking scene which lured in the brightest scientists from the country’s top universities and used them to boost their profit margins – without teaching them about the moral and legal consequences of their actions in return.A cum-ex deal, from the Latin meaning with-without, is a complex set of share transactions with the purpose of getting the state to reimburse a tax that was never paid in the first place.Cum-ex transactions work by trading shares at high speed on or just before the idend record date – the day the company checks its records to identify shareholders – and then claiming two or more refunds for capital gains tax which had in fact only been paid to the state once. Because the payout is automated, the trade can be repeated again and again.Some financial experts have likened the practice to the banking equivalent of parents claiming child benefit for multiple children when they only have one.“This was the environment at that time: a financial industry that – at least as far as I could see – was geared towards maximum profit optimisation,” the 41-year-old told a packed courtroom on Wednesday.“One tool to achieve this goal was tax optimisation: avoiding taxation as far as possible – and taking advantage of any opportunities that could be found or created. This was not the clandestine approach of a few. Rather, I saw it as the clear and openly communicated expectation of most major banks and their customers.”Hailed as a maths prodigy at school, Shields accepted a junior position at Merrill Lynch after studying engineering, economics and management at Oxford University because the trading room floor offered him a thrilling, dynamic environment. He was not alone: of 120 engineers in his year group at university, Shields added, only five went into engineering.Wearing a navy blue suit and the latest Apple Watch 5 with a white strap, Shields on Wednesday used a Powerpoint presentation to talk the court through the “cum-ex ecosystem” of labyrinthine trade chains he helped conceive and control, which prosecutors say cost the German state €450m. A translator tasked with rendering City trader jargon into German legalese was struggling to keep up.The financial rewards were breathtaking: for the five years in which Shields practised cum-ex trades through Gibraltar-based investment vehicle Ballance Capital, his personal income amounted to €12m. In 2010 Shields and his wife managed to purchase a £9.7m mansion on Chelsea’s Egerton Crescent, followed by a €6m Edwardian terrace on Shrewsbury Road, Dublin’s most expensive residential street.While Shields did not respond directly to the charges of serious tax fraud this week, he said in hindsight he had started to feel regret about devising the schemes, which hoovered up money that could have otherwise been spent on building roads, hospitals or nurseries.He told the court: “I often ask myself whether if I had my time again I would do things differently. Knowing what I now know, the answer is obvious. I would not have involved myself in the cum-ex industry.”He had made the “difficult decision” to cooperate with the investigation, which increases his chance of reducing a potential 10-year jail service. Co-accused Nick Diable (39), who worked with Shields for Germany’s fourth largest bank HypoVereinsbank (HVB), will also give a testimony in the trial, which is expected to last until next year.Shields said cum-ex trades were practised on an “industrial scale” in the first decade of the 21st century, and involved a vast network of banks, companies, brokers, lawyers and financial advisers. Even the most basic cum-ex deal involves at least 12 transactions.A spokesman for Deutsche Börse, which was raided in connection with the wider investigation in August, said it was cooperating with the authorities.During Shields’s appearance this week, the back benches of the court were packed with numerous lawyers representing high-profile banks and financial institutions that could be dragged into the scandal if the judge in Bonn rules that cum-ex trades did not merely exploit a legal loophole but violated the law at the time.Three characters mentioned in the testimony were notable by their absence from the court proceedings: Shields’s long-time boss and later business partner Paul Mora, and the renowned German tax lawyer Hanno Berger, who allegedly introduced him to cum-ex methods at HVB. A third man, Dubai-based British citizen Sanjay Shah, is alleged to have copied their methods to defraud the Danish treasury on a vast scale.Until 2015, Mora was a director of the Cinnamon Club, an opulent ​Indian restaurant located in a grade II-listed Victorian building next to the Department for Education and popular with politicians and business people. According to Die Zeit, the restaurant was where cum-ex deals were contrived and later celebrated, and one insider referred to it as the “cum-ex lounge”. Mora has denied wrongdoing, telling New Zealand media that all his trades were “approved by legal experts and undertaken in accordance with advice”.In separate investigations into the same scheme, the justice minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said that Cologne prosecutors are now conducting 56 probes with a total of about 400 suspects related to cum-ex. More than 400 iniduals and companies have been charged in connection with the scheme in Denmark.Estimated losses include an estimated €31.8 bn Germany, at least €17bn for France, €4.5bn in Italy, €1.7bn in Denmark and €201m for Belgium“The Cologne investigations have now reached a point that prosecutors say that cum-ex wasn’t a legal tax-driven trading strategy, but organised white-collar crime of unimaginable magnitude,” the minister said.A prominent German tax official turned tax lawyer whose past clients include the owners of BMW and companies like Adidas, Berger has been described as the mastermind behind the cum-ex scheme and was charged with tax fraud at a court in Wiesbaden last year. Based in Switzerland, he insists all of his dealings were within the law and has not appeared in court so far.A 51-year-old Kiwi with a penchant for rugby and Hawaiian shirts, Mora had a background in tax law before moving into investment banking in the City of London. At HypoVereinsbank and his own investment vehicles Ballance Capital and Arunvill, Mora is alleged to have worked with Berger to construct a vast number of cum-ex trades. Believed to have returned to New Zealand, where he has property investments in Christchurch, Mora has also not appeared in the German courts to far.A British-born son of Indian immigrants from Kenya is the key figure for investigations in Denmark, where prosecutors say he defrauded the treasury to the tune of €1.3bn, mainly through his hedge fund Solo Capital LLP, by copying the system used by Berger. Shah has denied any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377e5731a1651bcdeea9d3d519b8e7786c2c7fdb/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325fa07cf475060d6cea89c5022bafde","title":"climate change morally wrong carbon abolition movement","story":"Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was clear: make it illegalHuman-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there’s the greatest moral wrong of all – the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth.Yet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important – there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis – the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don’t wait around debating the optimal path or policy we stop it.Looking back in history, the climate movement can draw inspiration from another effort to right a deep moral wrong: the slavery abolition movement. There are clearly important differences between slavery and climate change, and I’m not drawing a moral equivalence between the two slavery was a unique moral horror and climate change is immoral in its own terrible way. But the climate community can find inspiration in the 19th-century abolitionist movement’s courageous efforts to make slavery illegal around the world.Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was morally righteous and powerfully clear: abolish slavery, make it illegal. It is time to do this for climate change: to make human carbon pollution illegal in every country in the world. It is time for a “carbon abolition” movement, to put an end to emissions.This is exactly what the science tells us we must do. In order to contain warming to 1.5-2C we need to bring global human carbon emissions to net-zero between 2030 and 2050. Not just reduce it. Stop it. This principle is enshrined in the Paris agreement, although few signatories have grappled with its implications.A set of firm deadlines, enshrined in international law, would force countries to immediately begin enacting the policies required to meet them, and force companies to start changing their business models. Some will protest that these laws would kill jobs and growth. But such clear deadlines would finally give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil-fuel economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation – bringing to life a new clean-energy economy.Getting every country in the world to enact carbon abolition laws seems a distant dream today. But things must have looked similarly bleak to slavery abolitionists in the early 19th century. But then, after years of campaigning and civil action, Britain made slavery illegal in 1833, France in 1848, the US in 1865, followed by numerous other countries and international bans in 1890 and 1926.What set the cascade of change going was the development of abolition as a mass social movement. History tells us that mass social movements such as women’s suffrage, civil rights and gay rights have always used moral arguments to change politics. I can think of no mass movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis.The climate movement is finally finding its moral voice. The school strikes, the global climate strike, Extinction Rebellion and growing support for a Green New Deal suggest that, at last, a mass social movement is rising that could tip our politics into action.But to catch fire this campaign needs a clear, simple demand, a rallying cry that everyone can share. “Stop climate change” is too vague and abstract, while the cacophony of narrower demands – “Stop fracking”, “Build more solar”, “Eat less meat” – is too confusing. These are all crucial issues, but many people are unsure of what to make of it all. Instead, by clearly showing the immorality of carbon pollution, we can activate people’s moral emotions and then focus those emotions on a specific action: making it illegal.We have a starting point: Britain recently joined the Nordic countries, France, New Zealand, the US state of California and 19 cities around the world in adopting net-zero targets, and the EU is considering a 2050 target. The next step is to shift these soft targets into hard carbon abolition laws.The 19th-century abolitionists were brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral enslavement of fellow human beings be stopped. Today, are we brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral destruction of life on Earth be stopped?• Eric Beinhocker is professor of public policy practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, and executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School.

Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project’s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis.Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches.The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis.It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where the Zandmotor project used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland.The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The company is currently discussing with Cornwall county council a potential sandscaping solution in Penzance where coastal erosion threatens the railway line.Jaap Flikweert, the coastal management adviser for Royal HaskoningDHV, said the Norfolk project was “a little nephew of Zandmotor”. “It’s less radical and it looks like a big, slightly more curvy beach nourishment scheme … it sticks out less from the shoreline but this is the best concept for the clients,” he said.Local people at Walcott in Norfolk – where the 2013 storms wrecked homes – welcomed the scheme but pointed to the loss of 1 metre of sand from the lower part of the beach since it was placed there in August. “A lot of it seems to have disappeared already,” said Ken Crowe. “I hope it does what it set out to do. Time will tell.”“People say the beach used to be like this 60 years ago,” said Cathy Kerby. “It’s improved the beach for everyone … we trust the experts know what they are doing and it will work.”According to Flikweert, some sand will be moved by the tides and currents and will disappear on to offshore sand banks in the winter but is expected to return in the summer. “That’s the dynamic of the beach. Of course it looks worrying, especially for local people, but that’s how it works.”The Zandmotor scheme in south Holland has surpassed initial expectations. The natural sea defence was expected to last for 20 years but a recent analysis suggested it could last twice as long.The Bacton project caused controversy in the spring when netting placed on the cliffs prevented returning sand martins from nesting in their regular holes. However, according to Natural England which monitored the sand martins, the birds dug new nest holes nearby and enjoyed a successful nesting season with as many birds as before. The new sand is also expected to provide habitat for shore-nesting birds such as ringed plover.Two-thirds of the £20m British scheme has been funded by the owners of Bacton gas terminal – including Shell – with £5m from the Environment Agency and additional funding from councils.Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “The climate crisis requires innovation and collaboration between countries, organisations, sectors and communities. The Bacton to Walcott scheme is a model for other climate resilience projects, protecting key national infrastructure while also delivering added coastal protection to the local villages.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566e13a0e577da0431900841ebdb135bb2c17a2/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d63c1b6a63e69b08c00b134f6b30cc5","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e53c2960554d5a8ca117846a0bcc4d341fd2d5d/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9ca99cf5f103f7b0dd8da299198b8066","title":"newcastle turn blind eye to peter beardsley inadequate coaching","story":"Peter Beardsley’s downfall, and ultimate disgrace, is arguably as much about a systemic failure at Newcastle United as the shortcomings of one painfully inadequate coach.In hindsight, the depressing path towards the former England forward’s 32-week suspension from all football activities after the Football Association found him guilty of racially abusing young black players in his care – charges Beardsley denied – was clearly signposted.It should have been blocked off for good in 2006 when Newcastle’s then manager Glenn Roeder discreetly and diplomatically removed one of the club’s greatest players from his youth development role, shifting him to an ambassadorial post where, by all accounts, Beardsley excelled.Back then there were no suggestions of racism, more a sense of disquiet about his already dated brand of “tough love” when it came to the man-management of young players.Yet such concerns had seemingly evaporated by the time of Beardsley’s reinstatement as a junior coach by Newcastle’s owner Mike Ashley in 2009. From then a conspicuous lack of communication and common sense – not to mention emotional intelligence and education – allowed him to continue running his former under-23s fiefdom at Newcastle’s outwardly modern academy base in a 1980s time warp.This “Life on Mars” type disconnect may explain that, while the FA commission punished him for “three obviously racist remarks” they were satisfied he was “not racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to a person on grounds of their race or ethnicity”.Those who know Beardsley well believe part of his mindset was stuck back in 1979 and a formative experience under the late Bob Stokoe at Carlisle United. He then was 18 and had broken into the professional game after a stint sweeping floors for £90 a week at a Tyneside factory. Stokoe ruled by crude, military style, discipline and, in an era when football training grounds were often brutal places where senior players delighted in seizing on any perceived weaknesses among teammates, the young newcomer was bullied mercilessly, both physically and mentally.Teetotal in a hard-drinking habitat and, with that unfashionable pudding bowl haircut instantly setting him apart as a strangely old-fashioned teenager, Beardsley received what was euphemistically known as the “full treatment”.If the experience toughened him to the point where he was able to impose his once fragile talent to often stunning, bewitchingly shimmying effect at Newcastle, Liverpool and Everton, it also moulded a frequently insensitive coach of the future.While many young Newcastle footballers would emerge from his school of hard knocks believing that passive-aggressive brand of sometimes scathing, scornful “tough love” – cutting put-downs and sometimes cruel humour rather than conventional shouting and swearing – was the making of them, others floundered in its unforgiving face.Thirteen years ago Roeder wanted to implement a very different coaching philosophy and, after he confronted Beardsley over their ergence of opinions, the parting of ways proved no surprise.After all, warning bells had first sounded at St James’ Park in 2003 when, despite Beardsley being cleared of bullying academy players by a Premier League inquiry, disquiet lingered in certain quarters.Damningly, it was still there when, in January last year, complaints of racism saw him first suspended, then removed, from his post. This time the allegations were more specific – and damaging – but it seemed that his allegedly careless, hurtful, offensive use of language was symptomatic of a wider problem stemming from an era when the term “woke” was still to be coined, football was a “man’s game” and mental health a taboo subject.If the written submissions defending Beardsley’s character supplied to the FA by colleagues – some black – including John Barnes, Andrew Cole, Les Ferdinand and Kevin Keegan emphasise that this was a complex, nuanced case, there can be little doubt that Beardsley struggled to adapt to changing times.Ashley had believed Beardsley’s enduring fame would serve as a magnet, attracting the best youngsters to Newcastle, but the local hero turned out to not so much have clay feet as a wooden-headed mindset. It contained a self-destructive resistance to spheres such as psychology and emotional intelligence which have helped a host of coaches, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate included, refine their modus operandi.By turning a blind eye to Beardsley’s increasingly square-peg-in-round-hole persona, Newcastle’s hierarchy exacerbated the problem. Exposure to more coaching courses might have helped but, remarkably, he did not complete his Uefa A licence until 2018.Given that his future employment prospects in football look extremely slim, it is likely to be of little use to a man who has morphed from local Tyneside icon to someone people point at in the street for all the wrong reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f466d53bad716f3e7c1c6c7a71a19c9eb4ac85/0_0_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f9375199143fddc3c0881cb0b88bac","title":"eden hazard real madrid ronaldo chelsea no 7 shirt","story":"Eden Hazard’s first start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night was always likely to be a fascinating subplot for anyone who followed his progress in England.Predictably Hazard was miles off the pace in Paris. This was his first start in a proper football match since June, and his first outing in the full white-noise glare of Champions League-issue Real Madrid.On the UK TV coverage Glenn Hoddle winced and grimaced and wagged his head, looking as ever like the sad, kindly community support officer in a rain-soaked oilskin who knocks at your door in the middle of the night to tell you your dog has been run over.Hoddle thinks Hazard went to Madrid “at the wrong time”. Perhaps he’s right. But then, there is no right time to go Real Madrid, except for that time you look down and discover you’re Cristiano Ronaldo. Otherwise, well, prepare to kneel, prepare to suffer.And so Hazard struggled, stuck out on the right in a team overrun in central midfield. He played like Eden Hazard, just a bit less so. The next day L’Équipe gave him two out of 10. Mundo Deportivo used the word “innocuous”.Watching Hazard in the stadium felt a bit different. He wasn’t terrible. He was the same, upright, scuttling, soft-shoed figure. But for me there was something else, a pall of sadness in seeing him out in all that space, exposed to that unblinking glare. Not to mention a sense of shared nostalgia, a lost intimacy that is no less poignant or tender for the fact it only ever existed inside my head and isn’t real.These are small details. For seven years Hazard was a genuine treat to watch in England. The press box at Stamford Bridge is low down and close to the pitch. You didn’t need to look up to know Hazard had just taken the ball, the only player on the pitch whose touch was completely silent but for a slight shift of air, a whisper around the stands.He was unusual in other ways. His brilliance came reluctantly. If this sounds like Hazard is soft, then the opposite is true. He was a driving force at the sharp end of two title-winning seasons. At times he played at a pitch beyond any other footballer in England, even the ones who won more and scored more. At others he meandered, a footballer whose own father had wondered if he might just be too nice and too normal to make it as a relentlessly high functioning machine-athlete.There was something else too, a quality of pathos. He is an oddly affecting figure. Watch him long enough and you could see – or imagine you could see, which is almost the same thing – the things this process took out of him, the way he was feeling. It became natural to think of Hazard as some vision of sporting perfection menaced by pitfalls and dangers. Although this might be because his name is literally the word for a vision of perfection, followed by a word that means pitfall or danger.And yes, reporting on sport can do strange things to you. I’m not proud.You stare at these people so intently, trying not just to understand what they’re doing, but to second guess it, to drape it in meaning. It becomes all too easy to invest theory and spiralling trains of thought in people who are often quite simple, and who would look at you strangely if you tried to explain your – wait, no – quite complex ideas about exactly why this thing is happening and not that thing that you’re not just investing this with an assumed and, arguably, quite creepy sense of intimacy.And yet on balance it does still seem likely – don’t you think? – that I do actually understand Hazard really well. That I could, for example, have had a really good talk with him on Wednesday night during that break in play where he walked across to the touchline at 1-0 down and stood slightly away from his teammates looking lost. I could have said, look, it’s a bit like that time where you were playing out of, and when José said, and the injury meant, and the other team did.He’d laugh and roll his eyes and we’d stand in companionable silence. Then he’d go back out and start playing a bit better. At the final whistle he’d wave up as he walked off and something would pass between us, information, understanding.Look, I’m OK if it doesn’t happen like that. Either way is good. It’s fine.But there are some things I’d tell him. First, I’d point out that the model he’s entered is in the process of failing. This version of elite football has prostrated itself before an unsustainable notion of inidualism and star power. The dynamic has been distorted, made to look idiotic and confused by the presence of a pair of outsize, freakish talents, one of whom used to wear that same No 7 shirt. It is a hunger that has yet to run its course, at a club that will continue to eat its stars.Then I would tell him that although he’s a wonderful player this doesn’t mean he has to be that kind of wonderful player, whiting out the screen with his relentless, repeatable brilliance. You don’t have to be an obsessive, robot-level goal-lunatic to work here – but it helps!Hazard is a more elusive talent, a less linear definition of value. It might well work out for him. The parts might still fit. But this is the real power of elite sport, the reason it still creates that strange, irresistible fascination. Failure, discomfort, struggle: these are often the most involving parts of the process. Fly, Eden. Get fit. Play inside a bit more.

Lewis Cook replaces Dominic Solanke for Bournemouth, which suggests a switch to 4-3-3 Danny Ings comes on for Che Adams for Southampton.77 min Boufal’s imaginative curler from the left edge of the area beats Ramsdale and bounces just wide of the far post. That was a lovely effort.74 min Cedric’s excellent cross finds its way to Redmond beyond the far post. He takes it down on the chest and hammers a shot that hits the outstretched leg of Stacey and goes behind for a corner. That would have gone in at the near post, because Ramsdale was flat-footed.72 min It’s all Southampton, as it has been for most of the second half. For all their pressure, however, Ramsdale hasn’t had any difficult saves to make.70 min “I rather liked VAR in the World Cup, if only because it completely got rid of real nastiness behind the ref,” says Joe Harvey. “However, while I hardly think the penalty not given was a clear and obvious error, it seems like they are too conservative overturning calls so far this year. I worry that referees will shade towards not giving penalties in the hope that VAR will give them, and the VAR official will not give them out of respect to the on-field referee. I will say I have yet to see something that appears to be an obvious red card either given or overturned by VAR this year.”69 min A long-range strike from Boufal is beaten away by the flying Ramsdale, a dramatic but ultimately comfortable save.68 min Replays suggest that Rico slapped Cedric, but the VAR official decided it wasn’t a red-card offence. Whatever, I’m beyond caring, it’s a complete shambles.67 min Rico and Cedric have a lively exchange of views after a challenge near the touchline. Nothing to see here.65 min Stacey is booked for a foul on Bertrand. Southampton’s pressure has been relentless since half-time.64 min “It’s a shame Southampton sold Matt Targett,” says Matt Dony. “He could have given Angus Gunn something to aim at. I’m here all week.”63 min Bournemouth make their first change. Ryan Fraser, who apparently wasn’t fit enough to start, replaces the goalscorer Harry Wilson.61 min This is pulsating stuff! Southampton almost equalise through Ward-Prowse, who steers a shot just over the bar from 20 yards after a lovely dragback on the run from Adams.60 min: No penalty! Bournemouth will be fuming about that if they don’t win. For what it’s worth - nothing - I think it was a foul on King, but I’m not sure it was a clear and obvious error from the referee. It’s a bit of a mess.59 min There’s a VAR check on the penalty appeal. This might be given. 59 min King bursts into the area and goes over after a clumsy challenge from Cedric. Chris Kavanagh says no penalty. I’d like to see that again.57 min Redmond stands up a cross beyond the far post towards Bertrand. He heads it down into the six-yard box, where Ramsdale rushes from his line to grab the ball. This is superb entertaininment.56 min Redmond shifts the ball away from Billings, 20 yards from goal, and thrashes a rising drive just over the bar with his left foot. It’s all Southampton at the moment.55 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Is that Ryan ‘Plastic’ Bertrand?”54 min Adams had probably overrun the ball when Cook fouled him, but I’m not sure that matters. Meanwhile, Harry Wilson is booked for a foul on Boufal.Ward-Prowse scores emphatically, rifling a penalty high to his right. Ramsdale went the wrong way.VAR check: penalty given! Yes, I think that’s the right decision. Adams was just inside the area when he stabbed the ball away from Cook, who sent him flying. 52 min It looked a bit soft but Chris Kavanagh has given it.49 min A fine move from Southampton. Boufal swings a pass across the field to Cedric, now playing on the right. He steers a cross at ankle height towards Ward-Prowse, whose first-time volley on the run goes just over the bar.46 min Peep peep! Southampton begin the second half. They’ve made a half-time change, with Ryan Bertrand replacing Kevin Danso.“The Saints have looked decent in attack,” says Mary Waltz, “but as soon as they lose the ball the Cherries cut through their midfield and back line without any resistance.”Yes, they’ve been repeatedly exposed on the counter-attack. Bournemouth have been excellent, though really precise in their passing and movement. Philip Billing and Harry Wilson are terrific signings.Peep peep! Bournemouth are 45 minutes away from a first ever victory away to Southampton. They’ve been cool and clinical amid the maelstrom and would be even further ahead but for that pesky VAR rightly disallowing Josh King’s goal. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.43 min Billing is down, holding his face, after a collision at a Southampton corner. He took Redmond’s shoulder in the face, though it wasn’t deliberate. Unlike this.42 min Redmond, who has been Southampton’s liveliest attacker, hits a fierce, wobbling shot from 25 yards that is punched behind for a corner by Ramsdale. It was a comfortable enough save.39 min Eddie Howe is such a brilliant manager. I hope he’s the next England manager, whenever Gareth Southgate hangs up his waistcoat.38 min Bournemouth break agian, with King’s shot deflecting behind for a corner. Their purpose and precision on the counter-attack have been superb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c59a83e3b4b57864c1abcc8513decc0e40e47a/0_0_5348_3209/master/5348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b261a327dd40f482bd606792cea4e482","title":"is thomas cook about to go bust your questions answered","story":"How Brexit, online competition and heatwaves at home have hurt the venerable travel firmThomas Cook is scrambling to raise £200m in extra funding as it tries to stave off the risk of administration. About 150,000 UK customers are on holidays overseas with the travel company. Here are the answers to some key questions.If Thomas Cook does not secure £200m in extra financing it could collapse as early as this weekend. If it finds the funds, it must then seek approval for a financial restructuring at a court hearing on Friday 27 September. Tough competition from online rivals, as well as Brexit, have taken their toll on a business that owes £1.7bn to lenders. The company has also been hit by high fuel prices and hotels pushing up costs, while heatwaves across Europe have prompted some consumers to stay at home rather than fly off to the sun.On the “latest news” section of its website, in answer to the question “Is Thomas Cook going out of business?”, the company stated: “We are working on recapitalisation plans to provide financial stability for the Thomas Cook Group going forward.” It added: “All our package holidays continue to remain fully Atol-protected. All Thomas Cook Group Airlines flights are unaffected and continue to operate as normal.”It’s a financial protection scheme (it stands for Air Travel Organiser’s Licence) run by the government-backed Civil Aviation Authority and covers most air package holidays sold by travel businesses based in the UK.If Thomas Cook collapsed, about 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas with the company would, in theory, be stranded abroad.It is expected the CAA would be ordered by the Department for Transport to launch a major repatriation operation to fly them home, at a cost that could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.Though with so many people abroad, this could take several days, and possibly a week or more.The CAA states on its website: “If you are on holiday when the Atol holder fails, we will try to ensure you can finish your trip and return.” It advises people to keep checking its website and social media pages for the latest information.The CAA says that if an Atol-covered firm collapses, and a customer has not yet started their trip, it would advise them on how to make a claim for a refund. Or, in some cases, the CAA “will appoint a fulfilment partner to provide the holiday”.If they booked flights only, they are not covered by Atol. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, you are legally entitled to get your money back if a company goes out of business, provided: a) you used a credit card to book the flight directly with the company and b) it cost more than £100. But section 75 does not cover goods or services bought through “intermediaries” – for example, websites that sell on flight and hotel bookings. However, these websites may have their own financial protection schemes andor be covered by Atol themselves. Meanwhile, some consumers may be able to claim on their travel insurance.As at lunchtime on Friday 20 September, Thomas Cook said that if customer chose to cancel their holiday or flight because they were “unsettled” about the news regarding the firm, then the normal booking conditions and cancellation charges would apply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b97b8cf0a8bd1a0ff2a819eb024c7f669937136/335_0_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f8c2a3b2345952dafe84c2c7cfadf9","title":"american airlines aairpass golden ticket","story":"My dad was one of the only people with a good-for-life, go-anywhere American Airlines pass. This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes – a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncle’s arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

The person adopting the strategy is usually a chronic complainer. Something is terrible about their relationship, job, extended family or other situation, and they moan about it incessantly, but find some excuse to dismiss any solution that’s proposed. The reason, of course, is that on some level they don’t want a solution they want to be validated in their position that the world is out to get them. If they can “win” the game – dismissing every suggestion until their interlocutor gives up in exasperation – they get to feel pleasurably righteous in their resentments and excused from any obligation to change. We all know someone like this. To be honest, sometimes I worry I know one so well that I share a toothbrush with him.Should you find yourself on the receiving end of this kind of complaining, there’s an ingenious way to shut it down – which is to agree with it, fervently. The psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb describes this as “over-validation”. (“Your boss should be fired‚ it’s terrible that there’s absolutely nothing you can do to make things better at work.”) For one thing, you’ll be spared further moaning, since the other person’s motivation was to vindicate her beliefs, and now you’re vindicating them. But for another, as Gottlieb notes, people confronted with over-validation often hear their complaints afresh and start arguing back. The notion that they’re utterly powerless suddenly seems unrealistic – not to mention rather annoying – so they’re prompted instead to generate ideas about how they might change things.“And then, sometimes, something magical might happen,” Gottlieb writes. The other person “might realise she’s not as trapped as you are saying she is, or as she feels.” Which illustrates the irony of the responsibilityfault fallacy: evading responsibility feels comfortable, but turns out to be a prison whereas assuming responsibility feels unpleasant, but ends up being freeing.Psychiatrist Eric Berne’s book Games People Play was a 60s bestseller, but its analysis of our everyday agendas is as relevant as ever"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd15acdfec05df74111e72e5f9da41a3418c9a0/0_145_2354_1412/master/2354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f59385e566fc38572bf81f05e5cfe68","title":"monogamous man in a three way relationship","story":"The monogamous man in a three-way relationshipMy partner and I have been very much in love for about seven years. Early on, she told me about a man she had met briefly, years earlier, to whom she felt a sexual attraction unlike anything she had experienced before. Nothing happened, so it stayed an unexplored fantasy.A year ago they met again by chance, and the chemistry was (she explained) instantly electric. We had a frank discussion about her desire for him, which resulted in her taking him to bed one afternoon for what she described as the best orgasm she had ever experienced. This was followed by weekly lunchtime sex (at my apartment in London).Soon afterwards, my partner and I decided to live together, and her lover began to visit our place once or twice a week. The challenge, for me, was to recognise that the chemistry she had with him was no threat to her love for me. I could not ask her to forgo such enjoyment (he is 20 years younger than me, 15 years younger than her, so there is a huge difference in the pleasure she gets from each of us). I recognised that the problem was mine, not hers.We interact comfortably and they feel unselfconscious about showing their mutual attraction in my presence. I enjoy seeing their foreplay or hearing them having noisy sex in the spare room – not as a matter of eroticism, simply two people having a good time.She would not want me to have the same, and so I remain happily monogamous.

However, when asked if the company was seeking such deals with other talent, Hastings said: “You could say that, but I couldn’t possibly comment.”Netflix is thought to be arranging an exclusive tie-up with Charlie Brooker, the writer behind Black Mirror and Bandersnatch, and to be in negotiations for a deal with Peter Morgan, the creator of The Crown.The company, which expects to spend about $15bn globally making and licensing TV shows and films this year, will increase its budget and productions still further to fight the challenge of the launch of a swathe of well-funded new rivals.In October, it will take over all of Shepperton Studios, home to films ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins, as part of a 10-year deal to guarantee the space it needs to pump out its ever-increasing number of productions without delay.Disney, which is due to launch its global streaming service, Disney+, recently struck a similar deal with Shepperton’s parent Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises.Competition is heating up in the streaming wars as new entrants attempt to break the global duopoly of Netflix and Amazon. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK.Apple TV+ will launch on 1 November, with star attractions including Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.Two weeks later, Disney+ will launch with content including the Star Wars films and original $100m TV series The Mandalorian, the Marvel universe, again including exclusive TV series spin-offs, Pixar films and family fare from Toy Story to Frozen, plus TV shows such as The Simpsons. WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service, will also launch next year.Hastings predicted the new competition would further increase the cost of programmes and talent. The Crown is thought to be the most expensive UK drama at a reported cost of £100m, but Hastings said that to compete with the deep pockets of the new entrants “we will raise the bid to hold on to great content … some day The Crown will look like a bargain”.Hastings said that as the market opens up, Netflix – which has previously been notoriously secretive about its programme ratings – would be more open about how its shows are doing and how it operates.He said Netflix had to “grow up”, and tried to allay public service broadcasters’ fears about its power.When asked about comments made this week by the Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon, about concerns in the UK TV industry about “a growing concentration of power in the hands of just a few tech behemoths”, Hastings said: “In terms of too much power that can be a risk in a society definitely, and we need to be aware of that.Kenton Allen, the chief executive of Big Talk Productions and a former producer of hits such as The Royle Family and Rev, welcomed the announcement of Netflix’s £500m UK budget, saying: “Bring it on.”However, he added: “As a producer there are pros and cons. There’s an arms race on talent they are doing some direct deals with writers so that takes those writers out of the market, so that’s a negative – you lose someone like Charlie Brooker.“It’s a US showrunner model and UK writers are not on the whole showrunners, they need producers. Where does that put the British producer? Out of the picture frankly. But it’s a mixed ecology so we can still talk to them about other things and we will be finding new talent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bbd7bef648162580a182d54fc4f0f86819abcc/0_167_1452_871/master/1452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8534d68ca8c2be9c840f19be37625327","title":"lets move to buxton derbyshire property","story":"After a few years in the doldrums, today’s hankering for wellbeing and hen-do spa parties has put a spring back in its stepWhat’s going for it? One thousand feet up in the clouds (OK, drizzle), with barely a street not at a 45-degree angle, Buxton is a town built like a fitness class. Work that body. It’s been a spot encouraging the restitution of health for centuries. The Romans spotted the Jacuzzi-warm water bubbling out of the hills, awfully good for settling the tum but it was the Georgians who turned Buxton into the Bath-of-the-north, with columns, crescents, domes and, if they’d been invented then, neoclassical hot tubs, too. After a few years in the doldrums, today’s hankering for wellbeing and hen-do spa parties has put a spring back in its step (no pun intended). It remains a place thoroughly good for mind, body and soul, with its elegant streetscape and refined arts scene. There are enough trees and countryside for a forest bath, and enough spas and sou’westerlies for a more watery soak. The result being that Buxtonians are as chilled and zen as a Buddhist monk, as trim and hench as Joe Wicks, with the lungs of a Nepalese Sherpa, the skin of a newborn babe and digestion as regular as a Swiss train.

One moment he was on The X Factor singing Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn to Sinitta in canvas M\u0026ampS slippers and a mum scarf, and the next he was covered in tatts, appearing in high-fashion spreads looking like he had probably caught at least one STI (one of the cooler ones, like chlamydia). Would he sound like a former boyband member, or the mini Mick Jagger he had styled himself as? The resulting self-titled debut was both: rock-influenced, comfortably cool, appealing to his teen fanbase and newer adult fans alike.With album two on the horizon, could Styles’s next artistic persona be coming into view? A couple of years have passed since his debut and he has now fully solidified himself as someone who wears Gucci flares, hangs with Stevie Nicks and writes bisexual anthems. Still, that didn’t prepare anyone for the onslaught that was his recent Rolling Stone profile in which we learned that album two was born among a swirl of magic mushrooms, Malibu beach parties, Paul McCartney’s Ram, T-Rex’s Cosmic Dancer, Haruki Murakami novels, transcendental meditation, a break-up with Instagram model Camille Rowe and an old American game called Cornhole, where you fling some sacks into distant holes. Or, in his words: “It’s all about having sex and feeling sad.”From that strange combo, you would be forgiven for thinking this album is going to be Mother Earth’s Plantasia with some spoken-word poetry about shagging over the top. But if we have learned anything from what pop stars say their albums are influenced by, and what they actually end up sounding like, we know there is usually quite a substantial gap in between. Zayn Malik, for instance, was said to be heavily influenced by Frank Ocean. Taylor Swift has spoken about her love of Annie Lennox. Grimes is obsessed with OutKast and Tool. In fact, Styles was recently spotted with super pop producer Max Martin, so maybe the new record is actually wall-to-wall bangers. Or, was his recent move of turning down the role of Prince Eric in the live-action version of The Little Mermaid because he’s got a collection of OTT water-themed musical numbers tucked up his billowing sleeves?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

Sadly the Conservative response has been woeful, from denial through to now a reluctant commitment to a broad and watered-down investigation that we fear will do nothing to address this problem.”Khan said Islamophobia was “endemic” in the Conservative party. He added that Karim’s claim was “extremely serious and indicative of the scale of the problem” and the minister must be investigated immediately.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation.“The Conservative party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. That’s why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur.”Party sources said not all the names provided were Tory members and the timings and details of any such investigation would be guided by the government’s review into a definition of Islamophobia.The government announced in May it had begun the process for establishing a working definition of Islamophobia, after confirming it would not be adopting the wording proposed by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims. The timeline for this work was unclear.During a Tory leadership election debate in June, Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, committed to holding an independent investigation into allegations of Islamophobia and asked the other candidates whether they would also commit to it. They all appeared to agree, including Boris Johnson, who said: “Hear, hear.”However, Johnson later said he understood they had committed to a general investigation “into all types of prejudice and discrimination including antisemitism”, not Islamophobia specifically."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/867f44f188ea6d31e9240c24540f2e4d945b5373/0_62_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98302aa7026cca3d97f68e0b568b20ad","title":"some people never convince david cameron reflects brexit legacy","story":"After three years of silence, the former PM wants to reclaim the right to be heard on the issue that defines his premiershipTowards the end of our conversation about his new memoir, For the Record, David Cameron’s mobile rings. His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. “I’ll be there, darling,” he assures her. “I’ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.”For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to “raise an eyebrow” about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. “One’s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,” he told guests. “And the other’s by Margaret Atwood.” His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.“I totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,” Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. “But I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain’s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.”This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron’s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK’s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. “These weren’t pretend ghouls and ghosts,” Cameron says. “They were real.” It’s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher’s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. “The single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn’t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.”“The EU is a law-based organisation that doesn’t like exceptions,” he continues. “The differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.” Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him “it would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years”.“My biggest regret”, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. “I should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available – picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.” He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were “a big deal for the EU. They hated it.”Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought “a lot” about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. “I agonise about that one.” He thought the Electoral Commission “got it wrong” by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. “We lost the vote so it’s worth asking the question.” He is scathing about Labour’s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. “They were awol.”Cameron’s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. “I’m a remainer,” he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold – and now unravel – since he walked away in July 2016.He says supportive things about Theresa May. “She was definitely a moderniser.” But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that “she got a deal”. He “shares her frustration” that it was then voted down by “the people who most wanted Brexit”. But, crucially, he says that “picking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.”And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. “If you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.”And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron’s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. “I think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum.

Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20190919-69059-20190920_TIFDCAm.mp3 Cameron’s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition’s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that “some of the early speeches were a bit ‘Hello birds. Hello trees.’” he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into “a modern compassionate Conservative party”. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.In the end, though, everything in Cameron’s story always comes back to Brexit. “It is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it’s so massive,” he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. “It wasn’t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem. The trouble was I lost.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f8dfcb0ab82e511e7d6c6167c567b99a432b63/0_109_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce56a9fd999b4002d12933b6d7bc1f00","title":"thornberry labour could back tory brexit deal in exchange for referendum","story":"Shadow foreign secretary says party should not remain neutral in any second voteLabour should consider voting for a Boris Johnson Brexit deal in exchange for the promise of a referendum, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has told the .As anti-Brexit activists prepare to make their voices heard at Labour’s conference in Brighton this weekend, Thornberry suggested her party could allow a deal to pass through parliament – if they could thereby secure a “people’s vote”.“I think it’s something we would have to consider. We would have to consider it seriously. We would,” Thornberry said.And the Islington South MP struck a markedly different tone to Jeremy Corbyn when she warned the Labour leader that it “wouldn’t be right” for the party to remain neutral in a second Brexit referendum.Speaking after an article by Corbyn in the  appeared to suggest that the Labour leader would not campaign on either side in a new vote, the shadow foreign secretary said: “It’s a really, really big decision that the country has to make.“I think it wouldn’t be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision. I just don’t think it is.”Writing in the  earlier this week, Corbyn said a Labour government would seek a “sensible” Brexit deal, and then “put that to a public vote alongside remain”, adding: “I will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.”But Thornberry, who will speak at a People’s Vote rally in Brighton on Saturday, said that Labour should make clear at the outset, and before any general election, that it would recommend that voters supported remaining in the EU.“I think we should have three parts to our policy: we have a referendum, remain’s on the ballot paper and Labour should campaign for remain,” she said.Late on Friday John McDonnell poured cold water on the suggestion that Labour could back a Johnson deal in return for a referendum, saying he did not believe the prime minister would come back with anything the party could seriously consider getting behind.“Everyone is saying let’s see what comes back. All the Tory media seem to be interested in is the Irish backstop, but there’s a whole range of other stuff we wouldn’t touch with a bargepole,” the shadow chancellor told the Daily Mirror.Thornberry’s intervention came as senior Corbyn loyalists try to head off a confrontation over Brexit in Brighton.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who was among those encouraging the Labour leader to embrace the idea of a referendum earlier this year, said his current position was now one all party members should be able to support.“I do think there is an element, in Westminster, of people pursuing a remain argument because they want to undermine Jeremy,” she said. “And the thing is, whatever Jeremy does is not enough.“At one point they were all saying, ‘Jeremy’s got to come out for a people’s vote.’ Well Jeremy’s come out for a people’s vote. He’s saying – and he’s very clear on this – it’s got to go back to the people. But all these people who were calling for a people’s vote, they’re not saying, ‘Oh that’s good.’ They’ve got some other impossibilist demand.”She urged activists to focus instead on other issues in Brighton, including tackling the climate crisis and liberalising immigration policy, which she believes is more of a motivating factor for many younger voters than Brexit.Labour’s Brexit policy has shifted significantly in a series of stages since last year’s party conference passed a motion saying a referendum must be among the options “on the table”.More than 90 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions this year, with the majority demanding a remain position.Their views will be hammered out into one or more “composite motions”, to be debated on Monday, and the party’s national executive committee (NEC) could also table its own Brexit policy statement.Some anti-Brexit Labour activists are wary of sparking a direct conflict with the party leadership. But Thornberry warned that unless it took a clear stance, Labour risked losing voters on both sides of the Brexit ide.She added: “I think that a lot of the leave voters are already extremely ambivalent about the Labour party. What we don’t want to do is lose people on both sides.“It is like, if you walk in the middle of the road and a car’s coming towards you, you have to decide which side you’re going to jump.”Thornberry is backed by remain-supporting shadow cabinet members, including Tom Watson, in entertaining the idea of supporting a Johnson deal on condition it is put to the public.A similar plan was proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson as Theresa May tried to win MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal – and its proponents believe they could potentially win a majority, with the support of the 21 former Conservatives expelled by Johnson.Watson said: “Emily is right to try to find an understanding with others that allows the people to decide on whether a government deal is credible. We should all be looking for solutions to end years of parliamentary deadlock.”However, other shadow cabinet members remain deeply sceptical. Abbott said: “I don’t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it’s got a referendum attached. That’s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.“Either it’s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market – or it’s not. The referendum is not an end in itself.”“Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don’t support it,” she added.Unlike Thornberry, Abbott also believes it would be legitimate for Corbyn to take a back seat during a future referendum.“If Jeremy is going to be a prime minister for the whole country, it is difficult for him to take a position which is contrary to 17 million voters,” she said.Thornberry was scathing about Johnson, whom she shadowed during his time as foreign secretary – the one cabinet role he held before becoming prime minister in July.“He doesn’t have any grasp of detail so the way to beat him was to be a girly swot,” she said, pointedly using the same phrase Johnson applied to his predecessor David Cameron, in a leaked memo.She said such language, together with Johnson’s taunting of Corbyn as a “big girl’s blouse”, was indicative of the prime minister’s attitude to women.“I think it’s deeply ingrained, the way that he talks about women. I think he has a contempt for women,” she said.She believes Johnson’s tough-guy rhetoric, including comparing himself to the Incredible Hulk, will not endear him to female voters.“I think they see him as a buffoon and somebody who doesn’t understand people, but also doesn’t care about the things that lots of women care about,” she said.“I just don’t think women want to be governed by the Hulk. They don’t.”And she argued that Johnson – with the aid of his key adviser, Dominic Cummings – was deliberately styling himself as a political “strongman” in the mould of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.“We have all these strong men in politics – whether it’s Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They’re all big men: it’s let’s look up to them, don’t be afraid, they’re looking after things. It’s so fundamentally anti-democratic. And Boris seems to be modelling himself on that.”In his Mirror interview, McDonnell also said that should Labour succeed in defeating Johnson in an election but fail to win a parliamentary majority it would not enter a coalition.“We’ll not do it with any of them,” he said. “We’ll go in, we’ll get a majority government, if we don’t get a majority government we’ll go in as a minority party government. We’ll implement the manifesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we’ll go back to the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident.

This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

Thousands. Every time I wheeled my bike out of my parents’ garage I turned right and I was on the worlds circuit.”It can surely be no coincidence that the joint race organisers, Welcome to Yorkshire, the tourism body for God’s own county, routed the women’s course right by her parents’ house in Otley. If it weren’t for a big hedge, Carol and John Armitstead would be able sit in their back garden and watch their youngest daughter whizz past up the hill to Farnley with the rest of the peloton as she attempts to win her second rainbow jersey.“As soon as it was announced, I thought: I have to do that race,” she said. There was just was just one small problem, albeit a nice one: she got pregnant last year and in September welcomed to the world her first daughter, Orla.Three days before she gave birth, her determination to become world champion again on home turf was undimmed. Instead of sitting on the sofa mainlining biscuits like other women past their due date, she was out in her Lycra, a bump jutting out above her cross bar, with her husband, Philip, then still riding for Team Sky.“Funnily enough, that last bike ride included the finishing circuit for the worlds in Harrogate. I remember thinking it was pretty surreal that I was aiming to be racing up the final climb in a year’s time and my life was about to change completely,” she said. “Looking back, I had zero idea just how much it was about to change.”The plan, post birth, was for the couple to both carry on racing professionally. “Before you’re parents you think: ‘Ah, it’ll be all right, what’s the big deal? She’ll fit in somewhere,’” laughs Deignan.It didn’t take many sleepless nights before Philip decided to retire at the end of the 2018 season when his Sky contract ended. He is now Orla’s primary carer and his wife is endlessly grateful: “We decided it was better that he focus on looking after Orla and supporting me in what would be a very difficult two years. I’m so glad he has because it has made all the difference to our family.”There were plenty of times on maternity leave when Deignan doubted her ability to return to racing, though she saddled up again the minute she got the all-clear from her doctor, six weeks post-delivery: “It’s just so overwhelming in those first few months when you are absolutely exhausted and she wasn’t sleeping. I breastfed her as well for the first six months, so I was going out training for three hours, coming home and feeding her and going out again.”So few professional bike racers return after having a baby that information on how to do it safely was limited. Dame Sarah Storey, the Paralympic cyclist who won two world titles 10 months after giving birth to her second child in 2018, was a key source of advice. “She breast fed until her kids were about two, and I was keen to understand from her how I was going to manage the feeds,” says Deignan, who is one of only two mothers on the UCI world pro tour circuit.The other is Marta Bastianelli, the Italian ranked fifth in the world, who gave birth in 2014. But perhaps her fiercest rival in Yorkshire next week will be the Dutch rider Marianne Vos, multiple world champion in three cycling disciplines, who has had an incredible year coming back from injury. Deignan might be the Yorkshire favourite but the bookies’ money will be on Vos, or fellow Dutchwomen Annemiek van Vleuten or the reigning champion, her old Boels Dolmans teammate Anna van der Breggen.Not being the favourite means she will race differently from last time: “I won’t be the one attacking and making the race. I will be holding my cards close to my chest and very much playing a tactical race, which is not what I am used to. But I am really excited about it. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.”These days, riding her bike is a welcome break from the sometimes monotonous drudgery of parenting, she says: “For me, being a full-time mum would be the hardest job in the world, without a doubt. If you’re doing it properly, if you’re all in and being the best mum in the world 24 hours a day without getting that break when it’s just about you and your own focus, well, those women have my utmost respect.”Becoming a mother has changed her perspective: “Cycling is less important than it’s ever been but I’m more motivated than I’ve ever been. I go out and I love riding my bike now. I have a perspective now having taken a year away from professional sport just how lucky I am to do it as a job.” She doesn’t think she has changed much but is overall much happier, following a stressful few years which nearly saw her banned from competing in the Olympics after she missed three drugs tests. “For me,being happy means I’m a better bike rider.”Deignan, now 30, was surprised to read a recent report that she would retire after the Tokyo Olympics next year. “I was quite shocked by that headline. My immediate goals are the world championships and then the Olympic Games and I haven’t thought about my goals after that. What will determine my retirement are so many unknown things, so it’s far too soon to announce my retirement.”Lizzie Deignan is an ambassador for the cycle insurance provider Cycleplan.

Rory McIlroy’s playing of the final two holes of the Wentworth west course in three over par on Thursday left him embroiled in a second-day battle just to make the BMW PGA Championship cut. McIlroy duly reached the 17th tee needing to play the last two holes of his second round in level to take his place in Saturday’s draw. A chip in from behind the 16th green meant McIlroy needed two, error-free holes five-five would suffice.The four-times major winner delivered a straightforward par on 17 before carving an approach to the last right. A chip from a treacherous position left McIlroy with two putts from 40ft to make the cut. He left the first 6ft short, proving how a sense of drama is never far from this golfer’s scene. McIlroy converted confidently from there his 69 and one-over-par aggregate means 36 more holes.The tournament organisers, never mind McIlroy, breathed a sigh of relief. He might be a dozen shots from the lead but the 30-year-old’s very involvement here raises the championship’s profile. “I’m still not in sync with everything but I battled well,” McIlroy said. “My alignment has been off and it’s hard when that happens.”At the business end of proceedings Jon Rahm has tied Danny Willett at 11 under par. Willett’s 65 on Friday was two strokes better than Rahm, who is seeking a fourth victory in one of the European Tour’s marquee Rolex Series events.“I think it’s a great golf course,” said the Spaniard. “That’s why I love coming back to Europe to play these traditional style golf courses, where they are not long, they are not overly complicated but things can get difficult for a player real quick. They make you think about it. You can be as aggressive or as conservative as you want off the tee and make it fun that way.”Willett had played his outward half in 29 shots, rendering a back nine of 36 something of a disappointment for galleries who sensed records could be broken. Willett, though, is perfectly content with his halfway position. The former Masters champion is a firm advocate of this tournament in September, switched from its previous slot in May.“It is a better date,” Willett said. “Our summers are kind of going later on in the year and our winters are moving to January, February, March. To try and get this golf course in great condition in May has always been a pretty tough task for the guys. They have done a great job of it but this year with that few extra months gives time for the sun to come out, the heat to come through and the growth to be more even. That’s why you’ll see some good scoring. We are not getting too many iffy lies out there and the greens are rolling really well.“It’s the best condition I’ve seen it in the 10 years I’ve been here. It’s all set up for a really good weekend.”Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Christiaan Bezuidenhout are tied at minus nine. Rose continues to defy the odds the 39-year-old arrived in Surrey with an injured knee after slipping last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/784ffada904ea996873e77774fd2a30f5f9b9d2a/0_164_4961_2978/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c98ee5cdd03902ec8d609d1c9fc41948","title":"sebastian vettel lower expectations singapore gp","story":"For the last two meetings of the Singapore Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel had strong hopes of victory. On both occasions he was still in the championship fight with Lewis Hamilton. Both times Hamilton took the win. This year the odds weigh even more heavily against the German but, given his poor performances of late, an error-free run may be the fillip he needs. Vettel says he still loves the sport but sorely needs to find his touch if Sunday afternoons are not to become more chore than passion.Four times a winner under the floodlights of the Marina Bay circuit – a stern physical and mental test of 23 corners in heat and high humidity, beneath walls that punish any mistakes – Vettel relishes this challenge. The task has not changed but this year carries even more pressure and Vettel conceded in Singapore this is not a track that is forgiving of a driver perhaps pushing too hard.Hamilton is already within touching distance of the title, 63 points clear of his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas. He won two years ago after Vettel went out in a crash at turn one as Max Verstappen looked to charge past him. Last year Hamilton put in a sublime qualifying lap to take pole and from it dominate the race. Then Ferrari had the better car at this track this time their weakness through slow corners puts them on the back foot.It is a disadvantage that is hitting Vettel harder than his teammate Charles Leclerc, who has won the last two races. At the last round at Monza, Vettel made an unforced error in spinning at the Ascari chicane, an ignominious mistake and not the first. Notably this season he also spun in Bahrain, crashed in practice at Monaco, went off track in Canada costing him a win and made a serious misjudgment in hitting Verstappen at Silverstone.It appears he is uncomfortable with the balance of the Ferrari and as yet the team have not found a way to adjust it to his liking. This, as suggested by the former driver Juan Pablo Montoya this week, is a technical issue for Vettel who is having to push himself harder and adapt his style. Pointedly he noted in Singapore his fundamental lack of confidence in the feel of the Ferrari beneath him.“I don’t think it is mental, I am doing the right things,” Vettel said. “It is crucial not to overcomplicate things too much and pull through it. Yes, here and there I might not have the absolute trust in the car and the best feeling but it is improving.”Marina Bay is a circuit where trust in the car is vital and where Vettel believes and Hamilton proved last year, a driver can make the difference. Ferrari have brought a new nose to Singapore looking for more grip through the plethora of 90-degree corners, where all the teams are using their maximum downforce packages.Under scrutiny and under pressure, Vettel remained hopeful of making progress but knows he needs a clean sheet on Sunday. “It is a question of details, lining them up,” he said. “I am convinced that sooner or later it will click and things will fall into place. There are always things you can do better. I can learn.”Hamilton, though, was looking ominously strong again on track. Unsurprisingly Red Bull, very strong on high aero circuits, performed well at Marina Bay, with Verstappen quickest in first practice. However, in the more representative second session run at night, Hamilton was just under two-tenths clear of the Dutchman, with Vettel in third. Almost certainly a one-stop race with overtaking difficult, pole will be vital and Hamilton looks to have the pace on his rivals to take it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32986d40fc01ae9286f27d458213546e162d70e0/0_363_4483_2690/master/4483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e85743849cfa4170e91cad4fdc39e635","title":"libratone track air review the noise cancelling airpods apple wont give you","story":"Great fit and sound, long battery, attractive design and pocketable case make for an excellent set of budsLibratone has given us the better fitting AirPods that Apple wouldn’t, with great sound and noise cancelling.The Danish audio firm’s Track Air+ are a set of true wireless earbuds, priced at £179, that follow the familiar design of earbud with stalk but no cable.Unlike the vast majority of AirPod-a-likes the Track Air+ actually look different, with triangular-shaped metallic stalks that almost look like an earring mounted on a pill-shaped lump with an earbud tip sticking out one end. Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used inidually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: playpause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.Pros: great sound, noise cancelling, super comfortable, brilliant case, aptX and Bluetooth 5, long battery life, solid connectivity, small and attractive.Cons: no AAC support, no volume control on buds, problem with wind noise, noise cancelling not the best.

Ahead of the finale, creator Steven Knight talks about the show’s ‘bizarre, dream-like’ boomFrom the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham, to the news stands of Bogotá, we are now living in a Peaky Blinders world.The BBC first broadcast Steven Knight’s series about a gang of razor blade-wielding dandies in 2013. Six years later, its star Cillian Murphy, in character as Tommy Shelby, adorns the cover of Rolling Stone Colombia.The final episode of the fifth season will be shown on BBC One on Sunday evening, as the Shelbys tussle with fascist MP Oswald Mosley and a rival gang from Glasgow called the Billy Boys.As the Blinders scale new levels of popularity, thanks in no small part to Netflix streaming the show in 183 countries, it is no surprise to hear that A-list stars are contacting Knight asking to join the cast.“We get a lot of people who get in touch and want to take part,” he says. “There’s Brad Pitt. Snoop Dogg. A$AP Rocky, too. I think in series six we will open the door a little to get some celebrity actors in. The main thing is they have to be good. We’ll just get the best actor for the part, as we did with Sam Claflin, who plays Mosley. He’s perfect.”He does, however, rule out cameos for their own sake. “I always find it difficult when the audience knows a person from somewhere else and they just drop in. It’s very distracting.”Could he be referring to Ed Sheeran’s much-maligned appearance in Game of Thrones? “Well, there are some casualties along the road,” he says.Knight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932.While the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies – former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist – the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate.“What I’m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren’t so known,” he says. “So Mosley was having an affair with his wife’s sister and stepmother, but history doesn’t count that, that isn’t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful.“The rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it’s happening now,” continues Knight. “I looked at Mosley’s speeches, and one of them began ‘Do not believe false news.’ He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It’s my good fortune – but the world’s bad fortune – that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let’s not do it again.”Knight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder – an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show. On the street below, there are thousands of fans dressed in period attire in tribute to their favourite characters.“It’s bizarre,” he says. “It’s like a dream.” A huge draw across the Midlands, there are fans from all over the UK, from France and Belgium. Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles.“It’s a whole world we’ve created, it’s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,” he says. “I do lots of projects in film and TV.

We just don’t know how many.”Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the event “a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what we don’t know”.The result, Borer said, was “hope and fear” for events that include the “Area 51 Basecamp” featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name Alienstock.“People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,” Borer said. “Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can’t go. When you tell people they can’t do something, they just want to do it more.”Eric Holt, the Lincoln county emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle a total of 30,000 visitors to Rachel and Hiko.Still, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against “critters, snakes and scorpions”.“It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry,” Arnu said.

It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the “study Xi” propaganda app, launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed.Most believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the  their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app.“From the top down to the bottom, I don’t think anyone will be able to escape it,” said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic.The on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be ided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping’s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi’s “important thoughts on propaganda”, according to Media Reform, a self-published news account on WeChat.News of the test, first reported by the South China Morning Post, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea.While Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of “Marxist journalistic ideals.”.“To be honest, it doesn’t mean that much,” the journalist from Shandong said. “Still, it’s a move to restrict public debate.”Authorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites. In July, a draft regulation under China’s social credit system proposed punishing citizens for publishing information that “violates social morality” or causes “adverse social impacts”.Xi has demanded loyalty from Chinese journalists before. In 2016, he told staff at three state-run news outlets in Beijing that they were “the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name”.According to Media Reform, the exam for journalists is not expected to be difficult. The notice sent to reporters from their editors said news organisations should establish study groups and begin preparing for the test. Sample questions will soon be uploaded to the app, according to the news website Sohu.The test will only be able to be retaken once. Journalists said they were not sure whether they would need to take it every time they renewed their press cards, done every five or six years.While some journalists said they resented the new rule, others were less critical. “Chinese society needs to strengthen political study and correctly lead public opinion,” said a reporter with a paper in the south-western province of Guizhou, who asked not to be named.“Western media may be able to report on anything they want, but they also still pay attention to the ideology of their countries,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ac12ea72de3e7b372b28bc945b7979518d46ea8/0_78_4578_2748/master/4578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b4903e1bbc79cf0857a830e4b45eeb3","title":"saudi led forces launch airstrikes on yemen city hodeidah","story":"Houthi rebels say attacks on four sites violate ceasefire agreement Saudi-led forces have launched airstrikes north of the Yemen port city of Hodeidah, claiming they were targeting Houthi rebels’ capacity to mount remote-controlled assaults on shipping in the Red Sea.The Houthi rebels, battling Saudi support for the UN-recognised Yemen government for the past five years, claimed the airstrikes on four sites were in violation of the ceasefire agreement signed in December 2018 in Stockholm. A Houthi military spokesman described the assault as a serious escalation and a reprisal for the Houthi-claimed assault on Saudi oil installations last weekend.Defending the attacks, the Saudi coalition spokesman, Turki Al-Malik, said: “The coalition’s naval forces detected an attempt by the terrorist Houthi militia backed by Iran to carry out an imminent act of aggression and terrorism in the southern Red Sea using an unmanned, rigged boat ... launched from Hodeidah province.”The Saudi attacks were seen by the Houthis as an attempted show of strength in response to the last Saturday’s devastating assault on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, a strike that exposed the vulnerability of the Saudi oilfields to terrorism.The Houthis continue to claim responsibility for the attack on the facilities which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity, and raised deep questions about Saudi Arabia’s ability to press ahead with its IPO sale. Videos showing cars queuing for petrol in Saudi Arabia were posted on social media.Both Riyadh and Washington are continuing to point the finger directly at Iran, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, describing the attack as an act of war by Tehran.3m people forced to flee their homes.85,000 -\u0026nbsp Save the Children estimate that this number of children under the age of 5 may have died through hunger and malnutrition.1m cases of cholera in 2017, the largest outbreak of the disease in recent history. 2,200 people died during it.

Two of the experts have previous knowledge of the weapons used in the four-year Yemen civil war.The Saudi government also took representatives from international media to Abqaiq and Khurais to show the extraordinary scale of the damage and assure that the sites would be back to full production capacity within a month or two.Riyadh told reporters that the assaults, a mixture of cruise missiles and drones, came from the direction of Iran and the weaponry deployed is not in the possession of the Houthis.Saudi Arabia has not identified the precise point from which the attack was launched, but unnamed US intelligence sources claim it was southern Iran, and the attack was undertaken with the knowledge of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said such such claims are false and designed to distract attention from Saudi breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen.The focus of the dispute is likely to move next week to New York where Zarif is expected to meet European foreign ministers, including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the UN general assembly. The chances of a direct meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Donald Trump is ruled out by Iran, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to try to act as a mediator between the two sides since he will hold bilateral meetings with both men.Seeking a resolution is complicated by the political chaos inside the Saudi-backed Yemen government, as well as a dispute between Yemen and one of its nominal supporters, the United Arab Emirates. In a sign of the collapse of trust, Yemen’s transport minister, Saleh Al-Jubwani, accused the UAE on twitter of supporting al-Qaida in Yemen to undermine the government.Yemen’s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, issued a decree on Thursday evening appointing new foreign and finance ministers in a cabinet reshuffle to lead the key state institutions. He appointed the former ambassador Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed Al-Hadrami as minister of foreign affairs, replacing Khaled al-Yamani, who resigned last June. He also appointed the fourth head of the Central Bank in as many years.In London Boris Johnson met the emir of Qatar on Saturday and in a statement from No 10 stressed Downing Street is seeking to de-escalate the crisis through negotiation.

Three women shed light on life beyond 100Adele Corsanego goes to a gym class three mornings a week and is always up for a party. She drinks wine with every meal, and eats pasta, cheese and tiramisu. She is 108 years old.“I’ve always been very active,” she told the  in an interview at the David Chiossone nursing home in Genoa. “I walked and cycled a lot, and played tennis for most of my life.”Scientists often turn to Italy in their quest to explain why there are so many sprightly people living beyond 100. The number reaching the milestone is rising: according to data released this summer by Istat, the national statistics agency, Italy is home to 14,456 centenarians, up from 11,000 in 2009.Of that figure, 1,112 are over the age of 105, more than double compared with a decade ago, while the number of supercentenarians, those aged 110 and above, rose from 10 to 21.Studies have tended to concentrate on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, or the southern regions of Lazio and Campania, usually in remote coastal or mountain villages seen as far from the stresses of modern life. But the largest proportion of centenarians (almost 650) in relation to the population size reside in the northern Liguria region, particularly in its industrial capital of Genoa, a long, tangled city of overpasses, underpasses and steep hills wedged between the sea and mountains.As of early September, Genoa was home to about 288 centenarians, the majority of them women. This is expected to rise to 350 over the next few months as people reach their 100th birthday.“Genoa has a strange combination of things,” said Valter Longo, a Genoa native and director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California. “The birth rate is low, lots of elderly people move there from other regions, the climate is warm, healthcare system good … then there’s the diet, of which fish and fresh vegetables have always been a staple part, and so you’ll have some people making it to 105.”The Genovese diet is mostly based on the typical Mediterranean mix of plenty of fish, fresh vegetables, fruit and occasionally meat, but also includes many inventions of its own.\u0026nbspThe city’s most famous food export is pesto sauce, made with extra virgin olive, pine nuts and basil. Foccacia bread is also synonymous with the city as is farinata, a flatbread made with chickpeas.\u0026nbspTestaroli, a type of pasta from southern Liguria, is also popular, while vegetable quiche is eaten abundantly.\u0026nbspThe Genovese also eat eggs, cheese and drink wine, with the added benefit of most of the ingredients they consume being produced locally or regionally.\u0026nbspAlong with Corsanego, who turns 109 in January, the  met Rina Verdoia, 102, and Pierina Travi, 104. All three women were born in the city, albeit from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Corsanego came from a bourgeois family that had the means to retreat to a mountain village in Piedmont during the second world war. She led a mostly privileged life and ate the best quality food.Verdoia was born into a poor family, and Travi spent a period of her youth in a home run by nuns after her parents were left destitute. All three had one child.Travi, who lives in a small home in central Genoa run by the Sant’Egidio charity, gave birth to her daughter at the age of 45. Verdoia is cared for by her daughter, who is in her 70s. Corsanego’s son died when he was in his 50s. Neither had parents or siblings who lived beyond 100.All three eat a simple, fresh diet, which includes pasta and wine with every meal, as well as the typical Genoa staples of pesto sauce and focaccia. Over their lives they would deal with common ailments by letting them pass instead of taking medicine.But other factors, such as Genoa’s topography, have possibly played a role in their longevity. “I always walked, everywhere,” said Travi, adding that she had never ventured beyond the province.Walking in the city is difficult to avoid, whether through the narrow alleyways of the centre or up and down the hills of neighbourhoods beyond.“Genoa has areas where people can live as if they were in a village,” Longo said. “My mother lived on a hill and would sometimes go down it and back twice a day with the groceries. These are also fairly friendly, close-knit communities.”“The problem is not so much an ageing population but having too few young people,” said Andrea Chiappori, the president of Sant’Egidio’s Genoa branch. “This makes people think negatively towards elderly people as they are seen as a burden. It should instead be a good problem – living a long life should reflect that the quality of life and social system are good.”Verdoia, who spent much of her life volunteering, said the secret to her resilience is “helping and respecting others”.“Especially those who are poor … everything you do to help others comes back to help you,” she added. Friendship is another key, she said. Travi “remains a child at heart”, she said. “I always got on well with others, never argued.”Corsanego, who is always the first to arrive for the hour-long gym classes and readily embraces the nursing home’s social activities, advised “living life in the present, without worrying too much about the future”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f01fe0598f6ff3c80122b992ae26a3aed1ec73f/0_367_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5279c434e52068277c920149416a019b","title":"we need to talk about hope","story":"This week’s Upside highlight was a live event in London – and a lot of environmental hopeFriday night and the lights were indeed low.

Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA When driving out of Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, towards the Border at Ballyconnell, the Quinn businesses dominate the skyline. There’s a quarry, cement works, and Quinn Building Products, with a massive letter Q emblazoned on the building. This is the headquarters of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), a network of companies once owned by the local businessman, Sean Quinn. The firm employs about 800 people and on Friday afternoon most of them gathered outside the Quinn quarry office to show their solidarity with their colleague, the company’s chief operating officer, Kevin Lunney. He was abducted on his way home from work on Tuesday and beaten “to within an inch of his life”, police said, before being dumped by the side of the road. In a statement on Friday, his colleagues expressed their “unequivocal support” for Mr Lunney and his family. “He is highly respected and held in high regard in our company for his hard work, commitment and dedication to the staff, the business and the local community,” the statement said. “This attack was not only an attack on Kevin, but on the entire staff and community.” It was for this reason, one worker explained, that staff felt they had to hold the rally. “Quinn is a family,” he said. “Kevin’s family. Everyone’s in it together.” Another spoke of his fear that the attack had put jobs at risk: “I’m worried. What if there are cutbacks, and jobs lost?” Both employees – who asked not to be identified – were among many at the rally wearing hi-viz vests bearing the name “Quinn Building Products”. Others were dressed in company uniforms. Reign of terrorAccompanied by a number of the company’s owners and directors, and by civic and political leaders, they walked the few hundred metres to QIH headquarters, where the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, read a statement from the staff. There must be, they said, “an end to this reign of terror” so that they could “feel safe in our place of work and in our local communities”. “Kevin is the most well-intentioned man you could ever meet,” said QIH director John McCartan, “a perfectly understated, diligent, intelligent man with a family and a community activist in every sense of the word. “To see him targeted because of his efforts to consolidate and protect an economic driver for his community and for the region is very sickening indeed. “I’m happy for Kevin that there’s such respect and love shown for him here today from across what is usually a ided political part of the world. There’s no ision whatsoever in this community today.” That sense of unity was much in evidence on Friday. Among those present was DUP leader Arlene Foster, who said: “Kevin has worked very hard to keep jobs in Fermanagh and it’s a great testament to this factory that so many jobs still exist here.” Also in attendance were students from St Aidan’s High School in Derrylin. Mr Lunney was a former pupil, the principal, Pat McTeggart, explained and had stepped in when the school was threatened with closure. “All of us in St Aidan’s regard Kevin as our friend,” he said.

But he stressed again that the British government has to come up with credible alternatives if it wants a deal.He said people need to be “honest and clear” and there has to be “a dose of realism” about proceedings. All the talk about “compromise and mood music” did not address the fact that there is a still a gap between both sides, he said.“Let’s not pretend we are solving a problem through the impression of effort and dialogue and lots of meetings when actually the proposals coming from the UK side don’t match the needs coming from the EU side – yet,” he said. “Maybe that gap can be closed and that was what President Juncker was referring to yesterday and it’s what the Taoiseach was talking about in terms of his hopes, but really it’s the British side that needs to move to get us there.”Asked if he had any concerns about British media suggestions Mr Juncker was showing signs of movement when he said he had “no emotional attachment “to the backstop, Mr Coveney said he had every confidence in the EU team.“President Juncker has said very clearly and we agree with him – if there are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then that’s fine – we aren’t obsessed about the name that is the backstop in a deal.”GuaranteesMr Coveney stressed the EU was insistent that the guarantees which the previous British government gave both verbally and in writing that Brexit would not undermine the Good Friday agreement was honoured.He pointed out that under the backstop guaranteed there would not be a need for border infrastructure and related checks and control that would undermine the all-island economy which has helped re-enforce the peace process.“We know the backstop does that and if the British side wants to remove the backstop, they have to come forward with proposals that do the same job and they haven’t been able to do that and that is the gap that has to be closed.”Speaking in Cork where he announced a 100 job expansion at Irish owned construction firm MMD Construction, Mr Coveney was reluctant to comment on calls by UK Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay on both sides to “take risks”.“Really he (Mr Barclay) has to defend his own comment – Ireland’s position is clear – we want to be fair in terms of trying to get a deal but I think we also have to ensure the onus and the responsibility is focused on where it needs to be.“And that is on London because it is London that is seeking the change that is creating a whole new series of problems to solve so the onus has to be on London to actually solve those with credible proposals.”He siad it did not matter what the solution was called “ as long as it is consistent with the withdrawal agreement and Ireland gets the guarantees we are not going to face the prospect of border infrastructure in the future”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4024109.1568928644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the brits never left any place until they were driven out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDes Long on A Secret History, a BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight series on the Troubles. Photograph: BBCOutside, Des Long’s modest three-bedroom midterrace house in a Limerick suburb gives no clue of his past life as a founding member of the Provisional IRA.Inside, however, it is a different story. Long’s republican background is proudly revealed in his front room, with bookcases stacked from floor to ceiling with volumes on “the cause”.This week Long was introduced to a new generation, many born after the Troubles were said to have been ended by the Belfast Agreement, on BBC’s Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History.In the documentary, the Limerick man said he had sat across the table from Gerry Adams at IRA army council meetings, despite Adams’s denials that he was ever a member of the paramilitary organisation.Long is no longer involved in paramilitary actions, but he supports those who are.“I do. I’d be telling lies if I said I supported anything else. There’s been a number of operations in the past couple of weeks, so there are still people at it.“As long as there are British soldiers in Ireland there’ll be people who would oppose them militarily. You can’t just say ‘Please leave our country’ – that doesn’t work. I feel you wouldn’t be going any place without a military campaign,” he says.Forty years on, he insists the British cannot be trusted.“You can talk to the Brits until you are blue in the face,” he says. “They’ll keep you talking and going around in circles.”One can “talk”, he says, but, “don’t have a truce”.Twenty years on from the Belfast Agreement, in the run-up to Brexit, Long knows he is in a minority. He does not care.“Fight and talk. When people read this, they’ll think I’m mad,” he says, with a shrug of his shoulders.British army watchtowers, once a feature of the Northern Irish landscape during the Troubles, can return at any stage, he says.“They may not be parading around in the streets, but they are here. They can get plane-loads of them over in hours.”In 1969 Long and others split from the Official IRA, forming a provisional army council during a meeting at a house in Victor Fagg’s house in Athlone, Co Westmeath.For 17 years, he was general secretary of the IRA executive.“I must be the longest ever,” he says.Later he was on the ardchomhairle of Sinn Féin, and on the National H-Block Committee.He split from Sinn Féin and Gerry Adams in 1986 – opposed to the party leadership’s initial attempts to persuade the IRA to give up its guns – to join Republican Sinn Féin.However, he left this group, too, in 2000 after differences emerged.Adams denialsAdams\u0027s denials infuriate Long, who bangs the table with his fist to show his feelings.By denying IRA membership, Adams betrays every IRA volunteer who fought for a united Ireland, Long argues.\u0026nbspHe looks distressed when he produces a newspaper article from 2013, with the headline ‘Those killed by IRA were murdered, says Adams’.He hopes he will witness a united Ireland: “I’m hoping it will happen in my lifetime, although I’m pushing on now. I’ll be 80 next May, if I live that long, unless somebody . . . Nobody wants to die, but sure we all have to die eventually.”He does not know, he says, if a united Ireland will come.“I never thought it would be easy.”However, old beliefs will not be abandoned now. “I’ll be a republican until the day I die. Whether people want me or not is another thing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"\u0026lsquoThis can only be fantasy\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Greta Thunberg in New York, responding to global actionCommunist Party gears up to dictate who will be reincarnated as the next Dalai LamaVerdict on Tokyo Electric Power bosses comes in only criminal case brought after 2011 meltdownFurther 40 injured after attack in which labourers and farmers accidentally targetedNeil Parker (54) fell down waterfall while walking alone on Mount Nebo in QueenslandOkinawa Letter: Growing resistance to a new military base is rooted in war-time traumaBillionaire Terry Gou\u0026rsquos withdrawal could help unite pro-Beijing opposition partySuicide bomber kills 26 in attack at rally for Afghan president claimed by TalibanPell is highest ranking Catholic in world convicted of child sex offencesHotel guests stuck in buildings and racing pigeons banned before October 1st celebrationsFears of escalating tensions as sensitive Chinese anniversary approachesShops close their doors as thousands take to the streets seeking pro-democracy reformsPro-Beijing and pro-democracy demonstrators exchange punches as police orders defiedFamilies face rupture after India declared some 1.9m people to be \u0026lsquooutlawed\u0026rsquoCarrie Lam\u0026rsquos withdrawal of the tabled extradition Bill was only one of five demands being called for by demonstratorsShops, schools and offices empty in response to lockdown and looming rule by New DelhiLaunch comes hours after North offers to resume nuclear diplomacy with USSeveral railway and subway operators suspended services as Faxai passed over ChibaDemonstrators wave US flag and appeal for democracy in 14th week of unrestVikram lunar lander had aimed to land on south pole of the moon"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025154.1568995952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"after the dalai lama how china is trying to take control of his succession","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDalai Lama arrives for a long-life prayer offering dedicated to him at Tsuglagkhang Temple September 13th, 2019. Photograph: Lobsang WangyalAFPGetty China’s atheist Communist Party is gearing up to dictate who will be reincarnated as the next Dalai Lama, a move that is deeply disturbing to many Tibetan Buddhists and one that is drawing international condemnation.At 84, the Dalai Lama is reported to be in good health, but he was hospitalised recently for a chest infection and he has significantly reduced his trips abroad this year.When a Dalai Lama passes, senior Tibetan monks traditionally engage in a ritualistic search based on spiritual signs and visions to select as his reincarnation a young boy born around the time the last spiritual leader died. But as the 14th Dalai Lama enters his twilight years, Beijing is stepping up efforts to control his succession.In August, the Communist Party held a “training session on reincarnation for a living Buddha” for more than 100 Buddhist monks from 73 monasteries, where they studied “government management of the reincarnation system”, state media reported. At the training, a senior government official stressed the government’s view that “the reincarnation system is never a religious-only issue or a Buddha’s personal right” but was “an important representation of the Communist Party of China’s strategies and policies in the region”.In 2016, Chinese president Xi Jinping launched a campaign to “Sinicise” the five state-recognised religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism – “to actively guide the religious to love their country, protect the unification of the motherland and serve the overall interests of the Chinese nation”.At the recent meeting, the Communist Party’s leader in Tibet, Wu Yingjie, stressed the importance of the “Sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism, and said its followers should integrate their religion with Chinese culture, align it with the party, and take Mr Xi’s “new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide”.Reincarnation database China issued regulations in 2007 governing the “management of the reincarnation of living Buddhas” to “better integrate the traditional modes of management into new Communist Party methodologies”. Under these regulations the government maintains a database of “legitimate” incarnated Buddhas and isolates any Lamas who they feel are not supportive of the party-state.A Tibetan academic, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivities involved, said that to get on the reincarnation database, monks had to go through an arduous indoctrination process, where they were trained to promote love for the party and social harmony, and fight against the Dalai Lama and other “splittists”.“The Tibetan reincarnates are becoming Communist-trained talents rather than religious leaders,” he said. “As the party is using them in this way, it creates a distance between reincarnate Lamas and ordinary Buddhist believers.”On the issue of reincarnation, the Dalai Lama has said in recent years that only he can decide on issues relating to his own succession and he accused the Communist Party of “brazen meddling” and revealing double standards that contradict their own political ideology.“The person who reincarnates has sole legitimate authority over where and how he or she takes rebirth and how that reincarnation is to be recognised,” he said. “It is a reality that no one else can force the person concerned, or manipulate him or her.”The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing an aborted uprising in 1959, and is reviled by China, which accused him of being a separatist and a “wolf in monk’s clothing”. The Nobel Peace Prize winner does not publicly advocate for Tibetan independence, but does push for greater religious and political autonomy for the province that Beijing governs with an extremely tight grasp.In efforts to wrong-foot China, he has said he might decide that he will be the final Dalai Lama, or that his reincarnation might be female, or be born in India away from China’s control.Two Panchen Lamas In 1995, the Dalai Lama named a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority in Tibetan Buddhism, but the Chinese authorities took him into “protective custody” and installed another boy, Gyaltsen Norbu, in his place.Most Tibetans to do not recognise or accept the replacement Panchen Lama, but pledge loyalty to the Dalai Lama’s choice, who has not been seen in public for 24 years.The Chinese-installed Panchen has featured prominently in recent months in Chinese state-run media on official tours in Tibet and abroad, increasing concern among Tibetans that Beijing is boosting his profile now to pave the way for him to play a pivotal role in the Dalai Lama’s succession.Earlier this month, Kai Mueller from the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights urged the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to request information from China about disappeared Tibetans, in particular the 11th Panchen Lama.“For many Tibetans, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima’s disappearance has come to symbolise the Chinese government’s efforts to interfere with and undermine Tibetan Buddhist culture,” he said. “His enforced disappearance also constitutes a grave violation of international human rights standards.”In response, China said the Dalai Lama’s selection of a Panchen Lama was “illegal and ineffective” and was “in total disregard of religious rituals and historical conventions”. A government spokesman said the man originally declared as the Panchen Lama was living a normal life and “does not want to be disturbed”.“The reincarnation of living Buddhas, including the Dalai Lama, must follow religious ritual and historical conventions and comply with Chinese law and regulations,” he said.US bipartisan support As China ramps up its efforts to control the selection of a new Dalai Lama, US lawmakers are promoting a Bill that would increase US support for Tibet.The draft Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019, which goes to the Senate next week, would make it official US policy that the succession of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist leaders are exclusively religious issues that the Tibetan Buddhist community should decide on. Under the Bill, any Chinese officials who attempt to interfere in the process would be subject to targeted sanctions.The Bill, which has bipartisan support, also says no new Chinese consulates should be allowed in the US until a US consulate is opened in Lhasa, Tibet’s capital.Matteo Mecacci, president of the International Campaign for Tibet, welcomed the proposed legislation, saying the Dalai Lama’s succession “represents a key test for the respect of religious freedom worldwide and is therefore vital to US national interests”.The succession issue is expected to ratchet up tensions in a region that is already under massive police and military control. More than 150 Tibetans have burned themselves to death over the past decade in protest against China’s rule. As they went up in flames, many used their last words to call for the Dalai Lama’s return to Tibet."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025254.1569001911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels sees little evidence of progress in latest brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay in Brussels on Friday. “We are moving forward with momentum,” he told Sky News.  Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardEPAUK “technical” papers on replacing the Northern Ireland backstop have done nothing to advance the Brexit talks, EU sources in Brussels say.Although the EU has for months been asking the British negotiators to put their proposals on paper, the three “non-papers” submitted by London on Thursday represent no more than a rehashing of previously discussed and unworkable ideas which go nowhere near to doing the job of the backstop, the sources say.But following more talks here on Friday between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the British Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the latter expressed optimism to Sky News that “there is a common purpose, we both want to see a deal”.“There is significant work still to do, but there is serious discussions that are taking place. We are moving forward with momentum,” Mr Barclay said.“The meeting actually overran,” he said, “which I think signals the fact that we were getting into the detail and we’ll have further discussions next week. I think both sides want to see a deal and we are working hard on that.”The one-hour scheduled meeting overran by 20 minutes.SketchyMr Barclay was sketchy on the substance of discussions although he continued to champion so-called alternative arrangements which the UK believes could substitute for the backstop . “They have an important part to play, the commission themselves has recognised that, ” he insisted.A somewhat more sanguine Mr Barnier did not join in the prediction game. A statement from the commission said the discussions “on the state of play of” the talks had covered the backstop and the future relationship political declaration.“It is essentaial that there is a fully workable and legally operational solution included in the Withdrawal Agreement,” it \u0026nbsptweeted in an oft-repeated mantra. “We remain willing and open to examine any such proposals that meet all objectives of the backstop .“Tánaiste Simon Coveney said on the BBC on Friday morning that there was still a “wide gap” between the EU and UK. He also warned that any arrangements that do not deliver the effects of the current backstop in full would lead to new border checks, which would have “very damaging and very difficult” ramifications for the island of Ireland.These would include “the management of civil unrest”, he warned.The “non-papers” – papers which are submitted by one side to facilitate discussion on issues without committing that side to their contents – are not being circulated to the member states at the UK’s insistence. Some diplomats express concern that such restrictions would inhibit discussion.The papers are understood to cover the well -rehearsed possibilities of the use of technology and trusted-trader schemes to facilitate customs checks away from the Irish Border, and the joint surveillance of the market in manufactured goods to ensure substandard goods do not enter the single market.The final UK paper discusses the scope of a potential all-Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) or agri-food zone.\u0026nbspOn that issue there is understood to be the beginnings of a meeting of minds.Ad hocBut EU officials are adamant that the backstop cannot be replaced by an ad hoc patchwork of sectoral-based measures.The UK is still not ready to submit formal proposals despite warnings from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Finland (which has the EU presidency), Antti Rinne, that it really only has two weeks. That would allow any deal to be prepared for the crunch EU summit on October 17th.“We will table formal written solutions when we are ready,” a British government spokeswoman said on Thursday.\u0026nbspThe two technical teams will meet in Brussels again next week, while British prime minister Boris Johnson and European Council president Donald Tusk are expected to meet in New York on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: With John Humphrys gone, who at the BBC will take the side of the listeners?John McDonnell pledges to abolish non-doms as Labour\u0026#39s Brexit civil war spills into open on eve of party conferenceArnhem may have been the right strategy, but it was too small, poorly planned and badly ledMayfair cleared of homeless \u0026#39tent city\u0026#39 amid fears of crime waveComment: Arnhem may have been \u0026#39fatally flawed\u0026#39, but \u0026#39continues to inspire\u0026#39 to this dayInside the Saudi oil plants hit in drone attack blamed on IranJustin Trudeau struggles to get re-election campaign back on track as blackface incidents mountWhistleblower inquiry may have been sparked by Trump asking Ukrainians for dirt on BidenJohn Bercow apologises to Parliamentary watchdog after breaching MP rules on outside interestsComment: Boris knows he needs to win the Brexit blame game Donald Trump threatens to \u0026#39release Isil fighters at Europe\u0026#39s borders\u0026#39 if home countries don\u0026#39t take them backVirginia Giuffre renews attack against Prince Andrew in first TV interview, saying she\u0026#39s willing to fight in courtSon who threw his terminally ill 79-year-old mother to her death spared jail Brexit latest news: An EU leak claims Britain\u0026#39s backstop alternatives are not \u0026#39legally operational\u0026#39Silver Spitfire attempting first circumnavigation of the globe encounters difficulty in RussiaCCTV boss in charge of monitoring body of Emiliano Sala encouraged colleague to watch player\u0026#39s post-mortemMercury Prize rapper who held up effigy of Boris Johnson’s severed head says he does not condone violenceFive climate change protesters arrested as Britain braces for weekend of chaosComment: Our children deserve better than Extinction Rebellion\u0026#39s dangerous fantasies.

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

I have already asked the FE Commissioner to urgently look into this matter.“School and college leaders must treat taxpayers’ money with the utmost care and in a way that benefits their students. Where this does not happen we take the strongest possible action.”But Ms Mbubaegbu defended the expenses claimed for international travel saying the work was done to increase the college’s reputation overseas and to create additional income.“Chief executives of further education colleges have found ourselves under fire in recent years within a context in which there is extreme pressure to generate income to survive,” she said.In a statement, the principal said her foreign travel helped to attract £2.5m of additional income from international business development activities over the past four years. \u0026nbsp“The expenses referred to in the article were approved and authorised correctly and are also subject to independent audit in accordance with college procedures,” Ms Mbubaegbu said.The principal added that a large amount of the expenses was reimbursed to the college through grants or other funding and some expenses were to cover travel and CPD events for other staff.The figures come after a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) revealed this week that a government pledge to boost funding for\u0026nbspsixth forms\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcolleges\u0026nbspwill leave them £1.1bn short of what they need to reverse cuts felt over the past nine years.School sixth forms have faced budget cuts of 23 per cent since 2010-2011, and spending for colleges have declined by 12 per cent over the same period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment,” Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said.The commissioner has written to the Department for Education and asked it to commit to halving the number of children failing to gain a Level 2 qualification by the age of 19 over the next five years.Climate change and mental illness among ‘biggest threats’ to childrenLast year, of the total 554,938 education leavers, 98,779 did not achieve this qualification by age 19.“The government must urgently investigate why the progress that has been made over recent years in closing the attainment gap has stalled and now going backwards,” Ms Longfield added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our sincere apologies that we have let you down.”Julia Stiles, Lizzo and Cardi B also star in the movie, which is based on a true story revealed in a New York Magazine article that went viral in 2015.Created with Sketch. Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The youngest was Dizzee Rascal, who received the award in 2003 aged 19, for his debut Boy in Da Corner.In his acceptance speech, Dave said: “I don’t know what to say. I want to thank god, I want to invite my mum up on stage. I want to thank everyone that made this happen, all the exceptional musicians that performed tonight.“I did not expect this...

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  In its five-star review of the album The Independent said: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”Dave is the figurehead for a hopeful generation on his debut albumDave made his acting debut in the third series of Top Boy, which was released in September 2019 on Netflix. He appeared at Glastonbury Festival in June, performing with headliner Stormzy and also for his own set on the Other Stage.Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK release date between 21 July 2018 and 19 July 2019 were eligible for nomination, with more than 200 submitted.The judges for this year’s prize were: BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, Clara Amfo, Danielle Perry (broadcaster \u0026amp writer), Gaz Coombes, Jamie Cullum, Jeff Smith (head of music, 6 Music \u0026amp Radio 2), Jorja Smith, Mike Walsh (head of music, Radio X), Phil Alexander (creative director, Kerrang!contributing editor, Mojo), Stormzy, Tshepo Mokoena (editorial director, Vice), Will Hodgkinson (chief rock \u0026amp pop critic, The Times).

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emily is the shadow foreign secretary, and should use language that reflects the importance of that role.”And Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson\u0026nbspChuka Umunna said Ms Thornberry should “withdraw her inappropriate remarks”.Mr Umunna said: “Language counts – comparing the Lib Dems to a murderous organisation is no laughing matter.

In an apparent act of revenge, she was passed over for the stand-in slot when the leader was absent for prime minister’s questions.Thornberry and Corbyn meet with the PM of Iceland, Katrin Jakobsdottir, in Westminster in May (Getty)And she played down the significance of Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s call for a second referendum before a general election, saying: “It’s just how he is, isn’t it? I haven’t seen him for a while ...\u0026nbspBut he’s deputy leader and he can say what he wants.”Ms Thornberry recently got into difficulties on TV trying to explain Labour’s position on Brexit.But she defended the position, saying: “We are now wedded to having a second referendum because so much has changed since three years ago. The question then is what will the choice be. We don’t want to put these lousy Tory choices of no deal or Theresa May’s deal to the public. We want there to be two good choices.“I would say ‘anything other than leaving the European Union’ is not a good choice but it would be second best. We need to have a choice that will look after jobs and the economy as best we can, which means being in the customs union and being close to the single market.“We’ve said we need, before we do finally leave, to have it confirmed with the public\u0026nbspif they do want to leave, this is a way that makes sense, or we remain. It’s important that we’re clear about that, but I’m never going to be able to do anything other than campaign to remain because I think we should be in the EU.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But some people appear to be still committed to at least getting close to the base\u0027s famous military gates, coming near enough to snap selfies alongside the warnings of how violently the base will be protected.The parties come amid warnings from the US military to anyone who might think of actually trying to breach the base\u0027s defences. There have also been dire warnings from locals, who have suggested that visitors might not be able to cope in a town in a harsh environment with no grocery store and little cellular coverage.Why are the \u0027storm Area 51\u0027 events happening – and what\u0027s going to happen now?Local residents \u0027preparing for the worst\u0027 as long-awaited weekend arrivesArea 51 town warns alien hunters to stay awayAbout 40 people gathered overnight with plans to storm Area 51, according to Nevada authorities.The group moved towards the compound\u0027s gates before leaving after heated warnings from officers, according to the\u0026nbspNye County Sheriff\u0027s Office.The department said the group gathered in the\u0026nbspAmargosa Valley about 3am and had left by 5am.They were described as being compliant and peaceful.The gathering occurred about 95 miles\u0026nbspfrom the events taking place near the tiny Nevada towns of Rachel and Hiko.At least two people were detained earlier in the day by sheriff\u0027s deputies at a different Area 51 gate.It was about 75 people that gathered at the Area 51 gate, according to the Associated Press. At least two were detained by sheriff\u0027s deputies, it reported.If you\u0027re just joining us, here\u0027s a rough summary of the nights events, which happened at four main locations:\tIn Las Vegas, people gathered for Alienstock, which was run like a traditional\u0026nbspEDM festival, with lots inflatable aliens.\tIn Hiko, there was another alien festival, with themed displays out in the desert.\tAnd in Rachel, there was another Alienstock, with live rock music played out across the Nevada sand, and themed events. Despite the warnings from locals, this appears to have gone largely without major incident.But perhaps most interestingly of all...\tAt the gate to Area 51 itself, some people did gather. They gathered round, chatted, took some photos and joked. While there are reports of at least one arrest, there was no attempt to storm Area 51.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The page, which encouraged people to “see them aliens” and suggested that enough people raid the base then they couldn’t be stopped, is bringing an unknown number of people to Nevada to take part in the event.Local officials have already signed emergency declarations in response to the event, and local residents warned people not to come. But the event is still likely to prove popular, leading people to take precautions against whatever might happen.“We are preparing for the worst,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who could see from his home a makeshift stage and cluster of portable toilets in a dusty area recently scraped of brush surrounding West’s little motel and cafe.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Promoters began scouting sites. A beer company produced alien-themed cans. A Nevada brothel offered discounts to “E.T. enthusiasts.”The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby air space this week.The U.S. Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to approach the gates of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.Area 51 tested aircraft ranging from the U-2 in the 1950s to the B-2 stealth bomber in the 1980s. The government spent decades refusing to acknowledge the site even existed, before releasing documents confirming it in 2013. Its secrecy still fuels speculation that it’s where the government studies aliens.County lawmakers in Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, are discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials there.“We’re taking precautions and checking the back roads,” Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said.Her deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by “Storm Area 51.” The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and promised to pay thousands in fines.Arnu said the military added razor wire to barbed cattle fencing on the Area 51 boundary near his home, installed more cameras and battery-powered lighting, and erected an imposing spike barrier just inside a gate.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for. I can’t even get aroused when Fiona Bruce comes on telly.”And Jenner Saunders  No. Silly question.Kane Robinson and Ashley Walters’ mesmerising performances as Sully and Dushane, on Netflix’s Top Boy.Mark Wright’s genuinely fascinating Who Do You Think You Are  drawing a direct line between Towie and the Spanish inquisition.GMB’s hungover host Piers Morgan making such a perfect Brexit idiot of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, on my favourite show, she did the left-wing equivalent of pressing the ejector seat button and yelped: “Food banks.”S Club ’s Paul Cattermole appearing at the First Dates Hotel, looking uncannily like Charlie Higson.And Goggleboxer Pete giving brilliant context to the claim the singer had been, “Beaten around by the industry”, by pointing out: “For £. an hour I had my arm shoulder deep in s***. And HE’S been ‘beaten around by the industry ’”Gemma Collins, Arg and all those other Z-list celebrities who think turning up late for everything is a charming personality quirk.Planner-knackering programmes that last exactly one hour . . . and five minutes.An advert for Britain’s smuggest and touchiest television network, Channel , maintaining, “complaints welcome”.First Dates maitre d’ Fred Sirieix being a little bit more in love with fame than is healthy.And Odd One Out, with Jesy Nelson of Little Mix, which really wasn’t the replacement for the Paul Daniels’ masterpiece I was hoping for or expecting.Well, fairly sure.DAVE, Wednesday, pm: Comedians Giving Lectures.THIS week’s winner is football pundit Danny Murphy and That Yellow B*stard from Sin City.Sent in by Dean Edmunds.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I thought - Im in a room and two guys walked in and Im in a bad situation.I jumped out of the window and I managed to get hold of the staircase.Wood, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail, told the court she had become friends with Tyrone Coleman after he appeared on ITVs show Take Me Out.She claimed that after discussing her relationship with the footballer, Coleman arranged for her to meet Rowe and his brother Nathan Coleman.I had been used as bait because of the person I knew and they saw a way to get money, she told the court.The plan that was put in place, that was Prince Rowes idea, was to get money from him.She added: Ive never been in trouble before.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft relating to the footballers watch and tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch and tracksuit.The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"job centres veterans work army","story":"The Sun can reveal the Work and Pensions Secretary has bagged £million from the Treasury to triple the number of dedicated ‘veterans’ advisors in JobCentres across the country to more than .They will each be responsible for helping services personnel and their spouses across a defined region – meaning nationwide coverage across all  centres.It marks another big win for The Sun’s ‘Never Forget Them’ campaign.Therese Coffey said the move was designed to help veterans over the culture shock when they leave the Armed Forces – and get them into a second career.She told The Sun: “The Armed Forces do our country proud and we are forever grateful to them for the sacrices they make in order to serve our nation.“The Sun rightly champions the importance of looking after our heroes and their families – both while they are serving and once they have left the forces.“This welcome new funding will provide specialist, inidual support to former service personnel and their families as they take the first steps to find a job and receive the financial support they are entitled to, helping them better readjust to civilian le.”The current small number of ‘Champions’ deliver employment support and benefits advice to ex-squaddies - and also raise awareness of particular issues faced by veterans and their families.Charities insist stable employment is “essential” for veterans’ mental health – but too many ex-squaddies face outdated stereotypes when looking for work.DWP insiders say hundreds have been helped into the private sector after their military career – but insist more work has to be done.The request for extra funding from the Treasury came from Amber Rudd before she quit the Cabinet.Neil Turner worked in the Army for  years before working for the Department of Work and Pensions.He said: “This funding will ultimately help ensure the right people are out there providing the right kind of support where it’s needed, when it’s needed.”The boost comes just days after Chancellor Sajid Javid gave Boris Johnson’s new Office for Veterans £million-worth of funding.Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer and Paymaster General Oliver Dowden will be in charge of the new Cabinet Office department.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many will not be able to begin an apprenticeship, start technical courses or enter some workplaces because they cannot meet the basic entry requirements.The analysis also concludes that children on free school meals- a key measure of poverty - are twice as likely as their richer classmates to be without this level of qualications at age .In total, %of FSM teenagers did not get to this level of attainment, compared to % of their wealthier peers.It is shameful that last year almost , children in England left education at  without proper qualications, Ms Longfield said.It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment.While we should celebrate the progress that is being made in raising standards for millions of children, it should never be an acceptable part of the education system for thousands of children to leave with next to nothing.She called on the Government to investigate the issue and commit to halving the numbers failing to get Level  qualications by age  within the next five years.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, said: It is shocking that the number of children leaving education without a qualication has risen by nearly a quarter in the last three years.It is clear that this sudden rise has happened since the Tories came to power and imposed brutal cuts on education and support for families and children.The figures are particularly stark for children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and with special educational needs and disabilities, yet more evidence that those who most need our support are those losing out.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: The number of children leaving school without basic qualications fell continuously between  and , but has risen sharply in recent years as the full impact of real-terms cuts to school funding has become clear.Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are the victims of a decade of austerity.

in a talent show.This picture is understood to have also been taken in the s.In the first image that came to light, Trudeau can be seen sporting a turban and robes at the Arabian Nights themed party at the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver.That photo was taken in  when Trudeau was a -year-old teacher at the private school, according to Time magazine.Trudeau confirmed he was dressed as a character from Aladdin and said he had his arm around a close friend.I should have known better then, but I didnt and I did it and Im deeply sorry, Trudeau told reporters on his campaign plane in Nova Scotia.Im p***ed off at myself, Im disappointed in myself.”I take responsibility for my decision to do that... it was something that I didnt think was racist at the time but now I recognise it was something racist to do.He later added: It was dumb.With Election Day just a month away in his bid for another term, the -year-old begged forgiveness from the people of Canada.Darkening your face regardless of the context or the circumstances is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface, he said.I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.I have always acknowledged I came from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that comes with a massive blind spot, the son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said.He then added: “I am wary of, of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.”Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who is mounting a serious challenge to the prime minister in the October  vote, reacted by declaring Trudeau not fit to govern this country.The prime minister, though, gave no sign at all that he might resign, and there were no immediate calls from any leading figures in his Liberal Party to step down.Maxime Bernier, the leader of the Peoples Party of Canada, slammed Trudeau as the “biggest hypocrite in the country”.“I’m not going to accuse Justin Trudeau of being a racist,” he said.“But he’s the master of identity politics and the Libs just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists.”Trudeau has in the past accused people who have questioned Canadas immigration policies as being racist.Elizabeth May, the leader of Canadas Green Party, tweeted: I am deeply shocked by the racism shown in the photograph of Justin Trudeau.He must apologise for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government.In this matter he has failed.New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh, who is sikh and wears a turban, sent a message of support to anyone who has ever been bullied over their race.The first photo appeared in the school’s - yearbook, The View.Vancouver businessman, Michael Adamson, a member of the school community, shared the photo after feeling it should be made public.The blackface scandal could undermine Trudeaus chances for re-election with less than five weeks to go before the national election.The photo could prove to be particularly politically embarrassing because Trudeau has been admired by liberals worldwide for his progressive policies.The Liberal Party leader gained a record  seats in , emerging as a darling of progressives around the world.But his purchase of a controversial oil pipeline and an embarrassing trip to India have sent his popularity plummeting.Trudeau was especially vulnerable following one of the biggest scandals in Canadian political history.This arose when Trudeaus former attorney general said he improperly pressured her to halt the criminal prosecution of a company in Quebec.Trudeau argued he was standing up for jobs, but he has struggled to deflect criticism."},{"url":null,"title":"unelected judges blocking brexit constitutional vandalism","story":"It is a stunt by rich Remainers whose only concern for democracy is that it must always deliver what they want.Failing that, their money, fancy QCs and our courts must do so instead.This weekend our top judges will ponder whether Boris Johnson suspended Parliament unlawfully, not to set up a new programme for Government but to avoid scrutiny of his Brexit strategy.But courts should have no veto over political decisions.

and days later Her Majesty said people should “think carefully about the future”.Yesterday Mr Cameron admitted he had revealed perhaps a little bit too much about the controversial request to intervene.He told BBC Radio ’S Today programme: “Some people would think, possibly even me, that I’ve already said too much about this”.But in an attempt to play down the row over his revelation, Mr Cameron later insisted he did not ask the Queen to do anything improper during the referendum on Scottish independence.The former prime minister - who has been carrying out a media blitz to promote his memoirs - said: I never asked for anything improper to be said or done.Mr Cameron sought support from the Queen after a poll predicting a Yes victory panicked him.He was also forced to apologise to the Queen after being overheard boasting that the Queen had “purred” down the phone when he told he had won the referendum.Yesterday the former First Minister Alex Salmond reveald that the Queen had summoned him to Balmoral to assure him those “purring” comments were wrong.Mr Salmond told the BBC yesterday: The Queen was not amused by the behaviour of her prime minister.In a further embarrassment for Mr Cameron yesterday he accidentally told a live TV audience that he “shat” at the TV when he first saw Boris Johnson’s big red Brexit bus.In what will go down as one of the most famous Freudian slips in British politics the former PM held his head in embarrassment as he corrected himself to say: “Sorry, sorry, I shouted at the TV.”It left ITV’s This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in hysterics.Phil Schofield joked: “Believe me, we have been ever-since.”Mr Cameron’s we Samantha, who was sat next to him on the sofa, opened up about her time in No -

asking to remove a very signicant section within the Withdrawal Agreement without any serious proposals as to how you solve those problems is not going to be the basis for an agreement.Thats why I think there is an onus on the British Government to come forward with alternative arrangements -they have them - which can resolve the Irish border question.He told BBC Radio s Today programme that Ireland is being asked to replace a guarantee around that border question with a promise that somehow well do our best.He said: We want to find a solution, we want to get a deal, and we want to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly and sensible manner, but we cannot allow Ireland to be the collateral damage of that.I think for Britain to ask us to do that is a very unreasonable request, and it wont be the basis of a deal.Boris will meet EU leaders in the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York next week for more talks.The PM will speak with European Council President Donald Tusk and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.When quizzed on the chances of a deal, during a visit to an army training base this week, the PM said: “I don’t want to exaggerate the progress we are making, but we are making progress”."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha cameron david cameron downing street pm","story":"The we of the former Conservative leader, , confessed to This Morning: “I was dancing around our kitchen.

I think the dficulty has just been that, Michael was a very, very close member of the team.“He was so central to my thinking on education reform and other things, and so watching what happened next was very painful and I did in some ways thought hed become quite a dferent person in all of it. But as I say, le goes on.”Yesterday Mr Cameron had hit out atover its editorial which discussed his “privileged pain” over the death of his six-year-old son.Speaking on LBC, he said:  “There is no privilege in holding your eldest born child in your arms as their le drains away.Death knows no privilege... from the little I saw of it [the editorial] I couldnt understand what it was trying to say."},{"url":null,"title":"cameron reveals obama tucked him in","story":"Mr Cameron snoozed on the legendary plane after joining the ex US President in Ohio for a basketball game in .The former PM was shattered by jet-lag and so Mr Obama led him to the nose of AF where there was a bedroom.Cameron told the Chris Evans Virgin Radio Breakfast Show: “There was a blanket with the White House crest on it and I lay on the bed.“He said Ill put the blanket over you and as he was tucking me in, he said I bet I bet you know Roosevelt never did this for Churchill.“So who says the special relationship isnt going strong  But we got on very well.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to keep him enticed and draw him in.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should play it smooth - make him want this now.She sent the player a number of provocative messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.He told the jury: The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is - it is all a sting.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: Something Im hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player - discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room - to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged general chit chat on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived - sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed nervous and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were only going there for one thing.All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room, he told jurors.One of the guys said something like: Is this what you are doing . It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Woods phone, stating that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and telling him to contact a number.I dont really want to expose you to the media butyou dont respond within  hours then you leave me no choice, it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: Obviously it is blackmail.Thats what they wanted to do - to get footage of me and take it to the papers.Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.She said: I had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single, she said.I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, its not right.She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, Wood told the court.The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.She said it did not go to plan as the footballer jumped out of the window before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn rules out coalition","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn rules out coalitionLabour cant get General Election majorityOn the eve of Labour Party Conference in Brighton the party leader said his party would not strike a deal with other opposition partiesShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video labour-autumn-party-conference-preview-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

I am not doing coalitions,” he told UTV. Earlier John McDonnell told the Mirror, Labour would not go in with the Lib Dems or SNP post-election.“We’ll not do it with any of them,” he said. “We’ll go in, we’ll get a majority govt,we don’t get a majority Government we’ll go in as a minority party Government.  “We’ll implement the manesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we’ll go back to the people.”   It comes after Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry compared the Liberal Democrats to the “Taliban” for their position of cancelling Brexit. She said: “I don’t think it’s very democratic to seek to overturn a referendum without asking the people first.”  Mr Corbyn defended his party’s Brexit policy of seeking to negotiate a new deal with Brussels and then putting it to the public in a referendum along with the option to remain in the EU, without coming down on either side.  He rejected criticism that his policy was a “muddle” and that he was failing to offer leadership on an issue of crucial national importance. “I am not sitting on the fence,” he told YTV.  “I think leadership comes from listening. I think leadership comes from asking people to look at the realities of the situation.  “It is not a muddled position. It is a position that takes the issue seriously.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour party conference guide timetable","story":"NewsLabour Party Conference guide: Timetable, events and key clashes at -day eventThousands of activists are descending on Brighton for sun, specs and suspicious shadow cabinet ministers.

Usually at the same time. The conferencerisks being overshadowed by Brexit - not only Labouraposs internal isions but also Boris Johnsonaposs seemingly endless talks with the EU.

So hereaposs a very potted guide on what to look out foryouaposre a casual observer - plus some speech and fringe picksyouaposre more involved.  Where would we be without saying the B-word. Grassroots activists will push for Labour to campaign unequivocally to remain in a second referendum. But Jeremy Corbyn - whoaposs promised a referendum, but not how heaposll campaign in it - has suggested he could remain neutral in the key vote on Brexit. The other issue of the moment is climate change. Labour insists its policy is already radical. But Momentum and grassroots activists are pushing for it to be more so with a aposGreen New Dealapos, committing Britain to zero carbon emissions by . The interesting thing about these two issues is that they will see many left-wing members - who grew out of support for Jeremy Corbyn - pushing left-wing Jeremy Corbyn to take a harder line on key policy. It shows how far Labour has come, just a couple of years after conference was dominated by fights between the aposcentristsaposand the left. These key issues will be thrashed out in a complex process. First,  pages of motions have been submitted by local parties.

Motions wordings can be watered down so that they please everyone - or no one - and donapost go as far as what the original proposers wanted. You can also expect debateson party rule changes to speed up discipline processes, proposed by the ruling NEC, or a grassroots bid to bring back the original Clause  scrapped by Tony Blair , which is firmly opposed by the leadership. Meanwhile, Labour is poised to announce it would scrap Universal Credit - with many expecting the statement from Jeremy Corbyn himself.

Charmaine Parkin, , said the six-in-one benefit threatened to push her out of self-employment by leaving her high and dry in spells when she found little work. Lawyers for the actor said the way UC was set up for self-employed people was “unjustied discrimination” and “irrational” - in a case that could have affected almost , people. But today a High Court judge dismissed her case, saying the regulations had been subject to the highest level of Parliamentary scrutiny. Justice Elisabeth Laing said claimants were not entitled to be subsidised to the same extent they were under the previous rules. She accepted employed and self-employed people are treated dferently on UC - but said that dference was not manestly without reasonable foundation.   Instead, the judge suggested, Universal Credit aimed to force people to quit unprofitable self-employment as their main job and look for better-paid work.Lawyers today confirmed Ms Parkin will not appeal. Ms Parkin did not want to comment today but her lawyer Tessa Gregory, of Leigh Day, said: It is disappointing that the High Court has decided to rule in favour of the Government. Universal Credit is failing to provide proper support for the self-employed, which is nearly a sixth of the UK’s workforce. If Ms Parkin had won her judicial review, it could have forced the DWP into a U-turn to help nearly , self-employed claimants of UC. Her lawyers Leigh Day were arguing over a key part of the benefit for self-employed people called the Minimum Income Floor . The MIF bans self-employed people from claiming more benefits under Universal Credit thanthey were employed by someone  on minimum wage.  Ms Parkin was assessed as being able to work  hours a week, so her MIF was set at more than £ a month - later increased to about £. Her legal team said that one month she earned only £, but was treated asshe had earned the £ MIF. That meant her Universal Credit payment was reduced by £.Legal papers stated thatsheaposd paid her landlord in November , even after her earnings she would have had £. left to pay for a month’s food, travel, bills and council tax.Ms Parkin said she would be better off without a job, as an unemployed person in her position would be entitled to an extra £ a month in benefits. Lawyer Ms Gregory said today: The Minimum Income Floor continues to punish the self-employed who have fluctuating monthly income. It runs completely contrary to the Government’s own stated aims of ‘making work pay’ under Universal Credit. The Courtaposs suggestion that self-employed iniduals can simply make employment their main activity whilst continuing their self-employment on the side is not realistic.

Angharad Carrington-Edmunds and her husband Jack are on a camping trip in Brittany with their baby and toddler. Unable to drive to catch their ferry home, the young family has had to extend their holiday - but have no money to spend and have resorted to rationing food. Theyaposve even had to cancel their four-month old daughteraposs christening on Sunday, as they donapost knowthey will be able to make it back home by then. They still have no idea when they will make it home to Crickhowell, Wales. Their car is stuck in a French garage with their possessions and cash locked inside, Wales Online reports.    On Sunday, the last day of their break, the family had taken a pedalo onto the boating lake at the camping resort. My daughter knocked the bag we had with us and suddenly we heard a little plop, explained Mrs Carrington-Edmunds. We looked over the edge and waited for something to surface. We could see the little bubbles rising. My husband looked at me and just said aposyou know what that was donapost you  That was the car keyapos. What should have been a quick-fix has turned into a nightmare, they say.  They managed to convince Eurocamp to let them stay on at the Demains des Ormes Eurocamp campsite, just outside of Saint-Malo, while they sort out their predicament. On the first evening, they scraped together € to buy a pizza for two-year-old Betsy, while they shared a portion of chips from the campsite restaurant.  They also managed to make one tin of haricot beans last three meals.    Itaposs like being on Iaposm a Celebrity, said Mrs Carrington-Edmunds, a solicitor in Abergavenny . We thought we were being quite brave, going camping in Brittany with a two-year-old and a four-month-old baby, but we had our car and it wasnapost really that far away. They were due to arrive back in Wales on Monday, September , but four days later, they are no closer to home turf. Now, the -year-old mother, who is still breast feeding baby Betsy, says she is at breaking point and was left doing all the leg work  in France.  Realising they were unlikely to make their ferry crossing on Monday, Mrs Carrington-Edmunds spent all of Sunday night on the phone to both the AA, who they had taken car insurance with, and Nationwide, who provided their breakdown and travel insurance. Mrs Carrington-Edmunds said: We realised at midnight, we had no car, all our stuff including money and clothes were locked inside with both of the car seats for the children.  On Monday, Mrs Carrington-Edmunds arranged for a French company to tow her car to a French garage, where it has remained, locked, ever since. Luckily Eurocamp agreed they could stay on, but their season has now closed and all the onsite facilities are being shut down for winter. Mrs Carrington-Edmunds even had to make a three-hour round trip to pick up a hire vehicle to cover them in the interim, so they could at least make a trip to the local supermarket to get some groceries. The family are trying to put on a brave face while they camp out in their caravan in the woods in France, but the stress is getting to them all, including their toddler, Evelyn. They are trying to keep Evelyn entertained by making music instruments out of plastic bottles, but she knows things arenapost right and started wetting herself.

Luke Phillips drove at speeds of mph through a north Hull housing estate as he attempted to avoid being caught by police. The -year-old drove the wrong way down one way streets and ran through a red light where he narrowly avoided hitting a pedestrian.He was caught after abandoning the vehicle and asked officers can I just have a moment to cry eyes out, knowing that he would be heading to prison as he had breached a suspended sentence he received just months earlier, Hull Live reports.Phillip Evans, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court the high speed chase broke out after officers in an unmarked car spotted Phillips, driving a Renault Megane, cut in front of another vehicle on August .    He said: “They saw the defendant pulling across a vehicle in front of the police car and turning into Arram Grove. The car in which the defendant’s vehicle pulled in front of had to brake. “The officers wanted to stop the Renault Megane in order to give him some advice about his driving, however, the vehicle sped off and engaged in a desperate attempt to avoid the attention of the police car.”Phillips, whose Facebook profile lists his occupation as been a full time f***ing legend, began driving at high speeds through the Orchard Park estate.Mr Evans said: “There the defendant left his vehicle somewhere in the region of Lingcourt on a grass area and sought refuge from at least two members of the public by askingthey would shelter him from the police. Neither were cooperative.    “Fortunately there was an officer in plain clothes in the area who was able to join in the search and tracked the defendant first on the roof of a garage. “When the police eventually caught up with him shortly thereafter he said on arrest ‘can I have a moment to cry my eyes out’.” Phillips, of Clanthorpe, Hull, then told police: I have got a one-year-old. I’m going to prison. I only got the car to make some cash and look what’s happened. He already has five convictions which include handling of stolen goods and criminal damage. In April , he was sentenced for possession of cocaine with the intent to supply, receiving a  month sentence suspended for a year. Judge David Tremberg told Phillips he missed “a golden opportunity” to turn his le around. He said: “You [Phillips] were one of the very few people who appeared before this court facing sentence for a serious charge that was not locked up straight away. “The court entrusted you with a golden opportunity to sort yourself out. That trust sadly was misplaced.” Defence barrister Catherine Kioko-Gilligan told the court that Phillips “lacked consequential thinking” when he committed the offence of dangerous driving. She said: “In terms of the offence this is not the worst example of its kind but it is clear that the offence was committed as a result of the defendant’s lack of consequential thinking.

Inside the cupboard there is a series of pipes as Luke points the camera downwards and shouts to his mate at the bottom: “Shine the torch up, shine it to the wall.” A glimmer of light can be seen many feet below where Luke’s friend is. Luke says to the camera: “There you go, that’s your drop. Very professional that Thomas Cook.” Another clip shows a long exposed cable protruding out of a wall across the corridor and through a door titled ‘staff only.

It comes out the wall there, and right next to a stairwell.” As Luke’s friend lts up the slack cable with foot. More footage posted claims to show the hotel with a leak in the ceiling, exposed electrical wires with tape around it, crumbling floors and walls as well as an un-tiled bathroom. Luke also shows a section of a staircase inside the hotel which he claims cut his toe. Reviews on TripAdvisor for the hotel, refurbished this year, are also damning.  Jon.E said: “I’ve stayed at numerous all-inclusive hotels throughout Europe and the Caribbean and unfortunately this is the worst - [it] doesn’t even warrant a  star rating - I’m going to be blunt, the hotel was only % full...this hotel is cheap and nasty, and should be avoided.” Craig F from Kilmarnock added: “Honest review by an honest person literally just back and felt the need to write my first review.

The Camelot theme park in Lancashire was based on the well-known medieval Camelot castle, which was associated with the legendary King Arthur, and comprised of a acre site near the village of Charnock Richard. Thousands of families would visit the park each year, before its gates finally closed in . Since then, the park has been left to crumble away - now laying in tatters, with rusting rollercoasters and a crumbling white castle at the entrance.Owners Knights Leisure blamed low visitor numbers on bad weather and events such as the  Olympics and The Queen’s Jubilee - with over  staff losing their jobs.  Whilst certain rollercoasters were sold to theme parks around Europe, seven years later, many of the rides remain abandoned, reports the Liverpool Echo .‘Urban explorers’, while warned off the site, are regularly found walking the tracks of the decaying rollercoasters, avoiding the   security that roam the perimeter. Previously, almost  new homes are planned for the former Camelot site by developer Story Homes. The plans are for up to  homes and an employment area, which Story Homes says could deliver about  jobs.    The proposals have proved controversial with residents in the area. The Camelot theme park opened in  and boasted a ft roller coaster called the Knitemare which spanned some  meters. It also had a log flume, a smaller size roller coaster The Twister, three large water slides and a large caterpillar roller coaster train which spanned the wholeand depth of the park running above ground and on ground level. Together Money set about calculating the hypothetical land value of eight intriguing abandoned places from around the globe, from derelict theme parks to uninhabited islands.

The outfit includes a white bodycon dress with a plunging neckline and a small white bouquet of flowers.The dress doesn’t exactly resemble the £, Givenchy silk gown the Duchess wore when she married Prince Harry last year, with its elegant boat neckline and its contemporary train - but at least it has three-quartersleeves, as Meghan’s did.It also comes with a bejewelled tiara and tulle veil. The model - who wears her hair tied in a classic Meghan scruffy bun - also has a suit jacket draped over her shoulder presumably as a nod to the American drama series Suits in which the royal starred.

Rebecca Hetherington, , knew something wasnapost right as far back as  - when she started noticing changes in her appetite. The criminology PhD student, from Newcastle, was also regularly coming down with colds. By , Rebecca was convinced there was something very wrong and visited her GP for a check up. Since then, she was turned away on a number of occasions because they believed she was fit and healthy. Rebecca said she was made to feel like a hypochondriac, and even cried in some of her appointments because she felt so confused about why she felt unwell. At the end of , Rebecca noticed a small lump in her neck, which she initially thought could be a sign of a throat infection or a virus.    Rebecca said: I started to notice the neck lump towards the end of , but it became more prominent after the new year, and by May  it was very visible. I developed a secondary lump near my collarbone too. At first, I though perhaps it was a throat infection or virus, but after a few weeks I became very worried it was lymphoma because of the armpit pain and night sweats, which are classic lymphoma signs. The lump looked quite flat but covered a large area of my neck, around  centimetres wide. The night sweats happened quite regularly at first, weekly from around  but by  it was nightly. I had to change my pyjamas and bedding regularly. As the months passed and the lump grew, Rebeccaaposs concerns began to rise. Not wanting to give up, she made another GP appointment for April ,  and fortunately she was seen by a locum GP that time who acknowledged her concerns and referred her for an ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to diagnose the lump.    By May of that year, Rebecca was diagnosed with stage two metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, which they estimated sheaposd had for three years as it had spread to approximately  lymph nodes. She underwent a thyroidectomy and neck dissection, before starting the highest dose of radioactive iodine treatment and spending five days in isolation in a lead-lined room as she was dangerously radioactive. Speaking about the diagnosis, she said: I was shocked, Iaposd been mentally preparing for cancer, but I was sure it was lymphoma, so the cancer diagnosis wasnapost what shocked me, but hearing it was in my thyroid was. I had never heard of thyroid cancer. Rebecca is monitored every three months for cancer recurrence, and in June  she was found to have residual cancer and required a second neck dissection. Rebecca is still not classed as cancer free and has regular scans. She added: I still have no feeling in my jaw or ear on the left side, and weakness in my arm and shoulder. I then developed severe hypocalcaemia because my parathyroid glands were removed and damaged, so my body is unable to regulate its own calcium, vitamin D or magnesium.    I now rely on medication to keep the levels stable. I had around  staples in my scar which were removed without anaesthetic a week after my surgery. I then received the highest dose of radioactive iodine and was put in a lead-lined room in hospital for five days due to how radioactive I was. I was nervous to swallow the iodine because no one can touch it, so you have to swallow it through a metal straw to avoid the radiation being opened before it hits your stomach. After the first day or two, when the swelling of my face, taste of metal and vomiting had died down, I was able to use my laptop for university work, which was a good distraction. Speaking about her journey to diagnosis and struggle to be listened to, Rebecca said: I was convinced something was wrong but was regularly told there wasnapost. For years I was going back and forth to my GP, even when I developed a lump in my neck.

Terried dad-of-two Zubair Shah has told how the walls of their family home aposcracked in twoapos on Sunday night as the family slept. He woke his we Menooma, , daughter Amima,  and son Haider,  and the family ran to safety fearing the ceiling would collapse. Fearing that the building could collapse and worried for the safety of other tenants, Zubair called the fire service and also contacted the council. Officials spent the rest of the night assessing the building while the family slept in their CAR before being told they would not be able toto their home in Walthamstow, east London. Zubair, , claims he first raised the alarm with council contractors after moving in four years ago but that no work was carried out to fix the issue.Describing the frightening moment, he said: “I walked into my house and it sounded like something in the kitchen was cracking.“I walked in, saw the plaster was pushed out and the next thing you know, the wall just collapsed. I thought the ceiling was going to cave in. The wall just dropped about four inches and I saw the ceiling wobble. “I grabbed my kids and my we and we just ran out of the house. Outside, you could see that the wall had cracked in two.  “I was worried about other residents so firefighters came around to check. “A surveyor came out and said the building wasn’t safe and then more and more people started arriving to inspect the building. “We slept in the car and we were allowed to take a few pieces out the next morning, so we could take the kids to school.” Now Zubair has blasted Waltham Forest Council - after claiming that the issue was raised repeatedly by residents. He claims he raised concerns with the council contractor after spotting hairline fractures in the kitchen when the family moved to the property in  - but that they told him they were paint cracks after a site visit.  Dog handler Zubair says he saw contractors examining the the block of flats in February this year. During the visit he saw them spray paint on an outside wall blue markings. Waltham Forest Council took on new contractors in April this year to handle housing repairs. He claimed: “The council have known about the damage in the building and they’ve done nothing about it. “We noticed a gap in the brick wall as did other residents many years ago and reported it to the council. “When we noticed it, the crack was about an inch but over time, its widened to about four inches.  As most of the damage was on the outside, you couldnapost really see it internally, until it happened at once. “Now I keep thinking about how it could have been worse. “I’m so stressed. I haven’t been able to sleep properly since it happened.” The family have been offered a flat in Enfield, in North London after he claims he spent four hours in the housing office on Monday trying to be rehoused but the family turned this offer down because it was too far away. He said: “We can’t move out, our whole lives are based around here.  “I worked very hard to provide for my family and I feel like I’ve let them down. It all just crumbled in front of my face. “It took me a whole day yesterday just to pick up a few items including my kids clothes. “I don’t know what to do. They jeopardised our lives by letting us live in that building. Itaposs a bit awkward and a bit cramped living in a one room space with all the belongings we have with us. They told us we would be staying here a week initially but they have extended it by two so we donapost know whataposs happening really. Weaposve not been told fully what weaposre going to be doing or whataposs going to be happening. They are promising things. I hope they will stick to but the thing is, right now weaposre at a lost end.  A Waltham Forest Council spokesman said: “Resident safety is always our top priority. “As soon as we became aware of structural changes at Walton House on Monday  September we began to investigate the reported movement. “A structural engineer advised that three households needed to be decanted as soon as possible – we immediately contacted these residents to inform them and offer support.

Andrew Nino and Kiara Paz, both , and -year-old Alyssa Brianna Vega are charged with first-degree felony aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Austin Police say the pair kicked their way into the family apartment and stole drugs and money at gunpoint. Desire, who was . weeks pregnant and her boyfriend chased after them. She was shot. Medics rushed Desire to hospital where she gave birth to Emery Skye who was placed on le support. Eight days later Emery passed away while being held by her loving mum and dad.  In a heart-wrenching, emotional and powerful account of what happened on that awful night brave Desire has spoken to Mirror about the trauma and loss she is going through and how God is helping her by aposguiding her out of her painapos. apos You will always be my blessing and I’m so hurt that you’re missing from my arms but you’ll never be gone from my heartapos    When I first found out I was pregnant I always wondered who she would become andshe would be healthy and I prayed and hoped to be able to give her a great le. I had a close friend lose her baby very young and the thought always stuck with meI ever lost Emery I would go insane and a part of me would die and I would be sooo lost. I worked the whole way up until a couple days before the incident and I was so excited for the opportunity to be a mother. I felt during those months and even now, that was my God given purpose. She was my inner strength and my motivation. She still is. One night I was at home in my apartment organizing for her arrival and moving things around. I kicked myself out of my only bedroom in the apartment and made my room the living room so I could have room for all her dressers and belongings in the bedroom. Of course the things filled the room and I still had things in the kitchen, living room and dining room areas that were for her as well. That’s how ready and excited my family and I was...    I heard a knock on my door but was never expecting company and when I went to check outside and around the areato see who knocked, I never saw a soul. A few minutes later, I had continued to look through herclothes and separate them by size to wash, when suddenly I heard the door get kicked open. Startled and confused I stayed in the room until I heard a manaposs voice asking where I was. I suddenly crept out the bedroom only to be encountered by a woman with a kne. She quickly grabbed hold of me and I begged and pleaded for her to not stab me that I was pregnant. There in the living room also stood a man in which the voice belonged to holding a gun, pointing it at my boyfriendright at his head. We didn’t know these people, we asked who they were and what they wanted. They came for someone who had problems with the boyfriend.  I begged and pleaded for them to let us be, that they were in MY HOME and that I had nothing to do with whatever they were there for. After a while of being told not to move and to shut up and being threatened to be shot or stabbed, angrily and disappointed they started grabbing our phones, car keys, all my medical cards and WIC card as well as my ID, social, and money I had in my purse that I was saving for an emergency and the money I was saving for baby. They took an Xbox as well since I didn’t have much except baby items in the apartment they tried taking what would be somewhat valuable or important to them. As they began to run out the house I hollered for the boyfriend to follow them and I grabbed a kne and ran out behind him. As soon as I stepped foot out the apartment I started screaming for someone to help me that two people just broke into my apartment with a gun and kne and were taking my things! I continued to run and as I came around the corner I noticed the boyfriend was fighting for my stuff back in which he was somewhat successful and was able to grab a few things back.  Still running I looked back to seehe was okay and then I heard a gunshot. I knew I had been hit because immediately I felt an intense pain spread throughout my stomach. I quickly covered where I felt blood escaping, the backside of my lower right abdomen. The pain in my stomach was too intense for me to walk so I sat in the street holding my wound, praying, yelling for someone to help me I had been shot. The neighbours then surrounded the sidewalks and were startled by gunshot noises and even more so to find me . weeks pregnant shot in the streets. They quickly called the cops and EMS to help. Shortly after the EMS had arrived and were tending to me. Right after the noise of the gunshot I could no longer feel Emery kicking in my stomach and I knew something was wrong. I remember answering questions that were asked and in between constantly asking them to help my baby, to save my baby. In the EMS ride they tried to detect her heartbeat in which they soon found out wasn’t there. They called for an emergency c section an anaesthetist.  Last thing I remember is being rolled into the emergency room with so many eyes on me, I knew it was serious but didn’t know how serious. A few days later I was more aware of things around me. I was then informed I was shot twice once in the left abdomen which exited the backside lower right abdomen in which I was applying pressure once I was shot, and another time in my left breast. The bullet went through my abdomen and nicked some organs and went through my uterus and intestines. I had to have surgery on my intestines and had a lot of internal bleeding and blood loss which was also being treated. They were able to save my intestines and uterus. However, I had also been informed that upon the emergency c section once they delivered Emery she was not breathing and had to be resuscitated. After resuscitating her they realized due to the amount of blood loss and the loss of oxygen to her brain that she was completely brain dead and airlted her to help fight for her le in a hospital that would be able to provide the medical attention she needed. The doctors and nurses in both hospitals were so great, and my family as well as Emery’s dad and his family were there every day through our battles for support. It was a hard time for us all. Nobody had been contacted until the next morning Sunday July st. Everyone was frantic and worried and hurt to find out what happened to me and how Emery had been hurt the most. We were able to FaceTime which kept my motivation to see Emery every day. When I first saw her she was completely motionless and couldn’t open her eyes, cry, or even breathe on her own. They had put her on le support to help make her stronger, however she wasn’t doing too well.  After she arrived to the new hospital that first night, she was having a lot of seizures and they knew there was no hope of her surviving or doing anything on her own. As I was in the hospital I asked for a baptism for Emery. They didn’t expect her to live past that night and I wanted to make sure she would be baptized and saved to go to Heavenshe passed. The ceremony was beautul. I prayed that night before I went to bed, praying for a miracle and for God to give her and I strength to pull through the night, and we did. A few days after my surgery I continued to fight to push my way towards being discharged and being able to go be with Emery. She was fighting as well. My baby girl was so strong and able to push through until Mommy was able to be with her again. I can’t express in many words the joy I felt once I was discharged and allowed to go be with my baby girl.  You can donate to Desireaposs Go Fund Me here I thanked God and still thank God every day for allowing me to have her and for the family to have her over those days which she was here on Earth with us. The doctors didn’t expect her to live another night but she lived for a total of ! When I arrived to her hospital the doctors informed me of how severe her condition was and told me her brain stem was completely dead and that there would be no way she could breathe on her own, cry, crawl, eat, walk, read, write, do anything on her own. Every day I spent with her they reminded me of this condition she was in and the how impossible it would be for her to do anything without the machines. That’s when they told me this is a decision that is ultimately up to me, however when do you finally say that enough is enough and let her rest  My heart was already broken into a million pieces knowing she was hurt and now knowing that I could never do anything to heal her pain or make her better completely demolished my heart. I felt so confused and hurt and angry. I didn’t feel like it was right for me to have to make such a decision to let her go being that I fought so hard and she did too for us to be reunited again and have moments together. I was informed of how the process would be once I made my decision and I was so stubborn. I wanted to do things with her that I would’veshe wasn’t brain dead. I signed a paper for DNR one night but that’s as far as they got me. I was stuck on being able to spend time with her just as the family was able to while I was in my hospital recovering. I appreciated the nurses they were so loving and understanding and allowed me to stay in the hospital so that I could be with her as much and as long as I wanted to.  I loved touch times the most and made sure to never miss one. Those were the times I was able to do those things with her: bathe her, change her diaper, take her temperature, and weigh her. After a few days and talking to a few more doctors I realized they were right. As much as I wanted to keep her this wasn’t the le I wanted her to have.... Mommy would’ve loved to take care of her evenshe was  with tubes and couldn’t do anything for herself. However what one doctor told me stuck with me: this is a decision you make out of love. My love for her was soooo strong and deep and as much as it killed me not having her and seeing her with all the tubes and motionless, I knew I should let her go and be free and not continue to suffer. I prayed to God every day and every night for strength and guidance and forgiveness and to watch over my baby girl. On the th of July we decided it was time to put our love for her in front of all  we were feeling or wanting and gave the doctor permission to take her off the tubes. I was allowed to hold her in my arms the entire time and have whoever I wanted in there. When they first took off the tubes her father and I and our parents were in the room.  Once they took off the tubes, they warned us that she may be able to breathe for a little bit or a few days given that her body was getting used to the machine. I prayed and prayed for her to be able to breathe on her own for a little while so we could all see her without her tubes. Once they removed the tubes, she continued to breathe! A miracle. What a long way my baby had come from that first night when they said there was no hope. I asked for the rest of the family to join us in the room so we could all love and support her and watch her fight and see how beautul she was without the tubes... I still held her through each breath she took. The more she took on her own the more you could tell she was fighting to take those breaths. We loved her dearly and knew she was strong but baby girl you don’t have to continue to fight to be with God and rest. She had already fought long and hard enough and didn’t need to prove to any of us family members how strong she was because she showed us that strength when she continued to live despite the doctorsapos words. She was breathing on her own for  min. The same time Mama had spent bleeding out after being shotand we praised God for allowing her to do that on her own. So many thoughts and emotions filled our heads after seeing her breathe on her own. We wanted to so badly put her back on the machine but once you decide, you decide.  She went peacefully in my arms that day and with the love and support of her immediate family surrounded by her as well as the grace of God. It looked asshe passed in her sleep and oh how peacefully she went and looked as her body started to fade to purple. I was at a complete loss for words. I never thought I’d be torn of my daughter before her due date. I never thought I’d have to experience such trauma nor loss. I wanted to cremate her to have her with me everywhere I go. However, we were informed that in order to do that the medical examiner would have to keep her body and it would take up to  months for us to have it back for services and then cremation. I was devastated. I felt like my work was falling down all around me and as I fell apart I had to remain strong. It hurt me to think that I would have to endure such trauma and then lose my first born daughter and also bury her! Hi, I am Emery Skye. I was born . weeks early because two people broke into my mommies apartment and robbed her.I’m not sure why they did that. Don’t they know she was getting everything set up for me to come home soon They shot her, the bullet almost hit me. Thankfully the EMS got there quickly. My mommy survived. She has lots and lots of staples on her tummy. Thanks to St. David’s Hospital I lived too.I heard my mommy and grandma say how perfect I am. But every time the doctor comes in I can hear my mommy cry.He says my brain has no activity. Something about the bullet caused my brain to have no oxygen.They say I will never be able to open my eyes or do anything at all. I’m sorry mommy, I really am trying.I don’t know why those people did this to us. Why they’d hurt me or my mommy. But today a man named Jesus told me he was going to make me all better, said I would be one of his angels.I would be able to watch over my mommy and my entire family. Iaposm so excited. I am never going to leave my mommy’s side. I can see now, I see my mommy. She is so beautul but she is crying, everyone is crying. I can see a baby in a white dress. I think she’s sleeping. Oh... I think she’s me."},{"url":null,"title":"angolan minesweepers living proof britains","story":"NewsAngolan minesweepers are living proof why Britains foreign aid is so importantEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror meets brave African men and women still cleaning up deadly remnants of bloody civil war - and finds out why theyre so grateful to usShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsA female de-miner works in a minefield close to the village of Tepa - thanks to much-needed British foreign aid \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Along the side of the track, mothers with babies on their backs and bowls on their heads, and men clutching primitive hoes form an impromptu line of honour, bowing and clapping, their lined faces oozing gratitude. Beyond the clearing is a field where cassava grows, the crop these people from the nearby village of Tepa need to take from the ground to stay alive. They take it every day, but at colossal risk, because that ground, like vast swathes of rural Angola, is peppered with landmines, the legacy of the -year Angolan Civil War, one of the bloodiest conflicts of the last century.  That is why the nine-strong mine team make that dawn march into the field, after East German and South African mines were found embedded in the soil, and why the people of Tepa are so indebted to them. And to you. Because, written large on the front of the de-miners’ visors are the words: “UK Aid... from the British people.” Aid channelled via the Manchester-based Mines Advisory Group, which has a -strong team in Angola, clearing almost a million square metres of minefields every year. A woman here has a Union Jack on her T-shirt. I say I’m from Britain and she grabs my hand and says “muito obrigado”, Portuguese for “thank you very much”. I’ve always been pleased to pay my tax but at .am as the sun rises in the remote Angolan province of Moxico I’ve rarely felt more proud to do so. Because that woman was echoing what chieftains of villages that are now coming back to le due to landmine clearances paid for partly by our money, had been telling me in the previous days. That without our help, they would have no le.  Here is the much-demonised foreign aid in action and far from looking like an unnecessary drain on the British taxpayer, it looked like money well spent. Landmines, which in  alone claimed , lives worldwide, are killing or maiming someone, mostly children, every single hour. But our aid is a fraction of what is needed to achieve the goal of making the world landmine-free by . Prince Harry will travel next week to the Angolan city his mother Diana visited months before her death in , to alert the world to the need to finish the job. It is a big one. After gaining independence from Portugal in , Angola slipped into a conflict between two former liberation movements which became a proxy war for the Cold War powers. It was a war with no front line, and both sides laid their deadly mines to try to wipe out each other. The people got caught in the middle with half a million of them killed, as Angola became the most heavily mined nation on Earth. Millions fled the West African country.  A land that had been self-sufficient in all major food crops and an exporter of others was left economically decimated when the war ended in . There was a . million ton shortfall in maize last year. Nearly a third of children are stunted, largely due to poor nutrition. Le is a daily struggle. But thanks to the aid Britain, the US and Japan are giving to organisations like MAGcommunities are coming back to le. In Tepa, the Sobadressed in a leopard skin hat and robe tells me that two years ago there were only five families in his village. Now there are  families, with people ing from Zambia and the Congo on hearing the landmines were gone.  The Soba is effusive in his gratitude: “My people used to live in fear but not now they have safe access to work and school. They can live again. I’d like to say thank you to the kind British people for giving us a helping hand that can save us from losing our legs.” A few miles away in Lundjacute, the women and girls greet us with a tribal song, the words have been changed to say thank you to MAG and the British people. The Soba tells us he ed there in  with just his two wives. His people began to follow in small numbers but by  there had been three deaths because of mines, and they were thinking of leaving. MAG stepped in and cleared it. Now there are  families and  children. At the start of school every day they make the kids give thanks to Britain.  In  the village of Luzi had just  people living there. Thanks to MAG clearing four minefields around the village it now has a population of ,, plus a clinic, five boreholes, a school, three churches and  shops. Hundreds of mines were found in Luathamba in , and the government told the people to leave. But they refused because the fields that gave them cassava and maize were the only things keeping them alive. MAG moved in and are still clearing mines there. The Soba said: “If not for the British money we’d be dying as we could not work the fields. Thank you, Britain.” "},{"url":null,"title":"haunting photos fukushima nuclear plant","story":"NewsInside Fukushima: Haunting pictures show ravaged nuclear plant eight years after tsunamiEXCLUSIVE: The Daily Mirrors Special Correspondent Tom Parry and photographer Andy Stenning got rare access inside Japans highly radioactive Fukushima nuclear plant eight years after a tsunami triggered catastrophic meltdownsShareCommentsByTom Parry:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video protesters-outraged-japanese-court-clears-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Our minder, one of thousands of electricity company staff working on the mammoth clean-up, warns us staying longer than five minutes is hazardous. We are here to witness the devastation left behind by a catastrophe which has ruined so many lives. The damage is evident eight years on - with mangled roofs and twisted metal, and steel cladding covering gaping holes in the wall of a reactor building. Our visit also coincides with a Japanese court ruling the three men in charge at the time of the  meltdown were not guilty of professional negligence.    Yesterdayaposs judgment that Tokyo Electric Power Company executives Tsunehisa Katsumata, , Sakae Muto, , and Ichiro Takekuro, , could not be held directly responsible for the deaths of more than  hospital patients, among , people evacuated from around the plant, has caused outrage. Lawyer Hiroyuki Kawai, representing more than , locals who filed the criminal complaint against TEPCO, insists the legal battle for justice will continue for years to come. Our ultimate goal is to eradicate dangerous nuclear plants that have thrown many residents into despair, he says, vowing to launch an appeal.  Many of those affected claim the disaster, triggered by a . magnitude earthquake and tsunami, could have been avoided. Prosecutors claimed the executives had access to studies predicting the risk of a nuclear calamity from a tsunami. And in  a special commission concluded Fukushima was a profoundly man-made disaster.  It found TEPCO failed to meet basic safety requirements. The firm deliberately took away clfs which would have protected reactors from a tsunami and also disregarded warnings its sea wall was not high enough. Eight years on, the damage is still evident in the mangled roofs of the Fukushima Daiichi power station reactors and in the ghost towns inside the exclusion zone to which refugees are only now ing.  Entering the prohibited site through a series of police checkpoints, we pass enormous silos where tens of thousands of sealed sacks of radioactive soil are being stored. In the decontamination squad mess building, we see hundreds of workers putting on hazmat suits and breathing masks which are sterilised at the end of the sht. They cannot take anything from the high-radioactivity zone off site.  We are issued with protective masks, goggles, gloves, boots and hard-hats to wear in the most toxic areas. Jagged gaping holes in the shredded wall of a reactor building are reinforced by steel cladding - the only barrier between us and a pool of hazardously radioactive melted fuel. The pipe network of the cooling system which failed when it was pummelled by the -metre high surge of seawater is now a rusted tangle in a derelict shell.  When the earthquake happened, our TEPCO host explains, the three reactors automatically shut down. Emergency diesel generators pumped coolant the through their cores, but when the tsunami struck  minutes later it engulfed the protective seawall flooded the basement. The generators were knocked out and coolant stopped flowing, causing fuel meltdowns.  As workers struggled to re-supply power to the reactorsapos cooling systems over the following days, an intense build-up of hydrogen caused explosions in four of the total six reactors. From a viewing  we can how the steel skeleton of one of the reactors has been left exposed by the blasts. A line on the side of another reactor marks the height of the tsunami.  Robots are being used to remove radioactive debris and spent nuclear fuel from the reactors, we are told. The scale of the clean-up process is most graphically illustrated by the endless rows of -metre high cylinders used to store nearly one million cubic metres of contaminated water. Although a stf sea breeze drts in behind us, our guide snappily tells us it is time to move on.    I can feel a dull ache at the back of my throat, symptomatic of increased background radiation. Another reading is taken before we leave - signicantly higher than it was on arrival. Japanaposs government wants to banish the stigma around Fukushima and the region will next year host several Olympic events.  It will be , however, before TEPCO will be able to declare the site completely safe. Spokesman Katsuyoshi Oyama tells me: Obviously we are not proud, but it is right that we do this properly for the people of Fukushima. To revitalise the area TEPCO must do everything correctly we will stick with this until it is complete.  As Britain increases its dependence on nuclear power from a quarter to a third in the next  years, the lessons of Fukushima are there to be heeded. Although the UK is not prone to earthquakes like Japan, campaigners say there is a danger from flooding. Reactors typically need to be situated near water to keep the reactors cool. Over-budget Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast is the first nuclear plant to be built in Britain since , one of several planned for the coming decades.

If we want to win a league we have to perform as we did in the second half but for  minutes.“We know it’s going to be a hard league. We’re sitting at the top of it. If we’d lost the first game of the season and won our next four the atmosphere would be dferent and the questions would be dferent.“We hope to stay at the top. We’ve had a wee dip but, over the course of a season, there will be more dips like this. We have to make sure we beat Arbroath on Saturday.”Going back to his former stomping ground on the Ayrshire coast, Smith knew he and another ex-Ayr man Lawrence Shankland were going to be under the spotlight wearing tangerine.He accepts they didn’t perform and makes no excuses for himself or anyone  at the Terrors, who know all about the threat and quality of The Honest Men.United lost both of their visits there last season when Smith and Shankland were among the Somerset tormentors-in-chief.Smith added: “From first-hand experience I know Ayr’s philosophy going into every game, particularly playing against Dundee United, who they did well against last season.“They would have been keen to keep that going. Me, Shanks and the other boys knew that they have a squad of good players.“Fair play to them but we didn’t do enough. We didn’t compete and put our stamp on the game. We didn’t deserve to take anything.”Right-back Smith accepts they can’t expect to win every game this season but believes it was the performance which angered those connected with United most.Ayr controlled proceedings for most of the  minutes and Smith believes they can only look at themselves as they seek to get back to winning ways in their quest for promotion.“You can’t win every game but the manner in which we lost was not acceptable,” he said.“We didn’t turn up and Ayr took advantage. They are a good side and we can’t afford to take our foot off the gas at any point.“The second half was better. In the first half, we were outworked, which can’t happen.“First and foremost, we need to look at ourselves.“I don’t think we passed the ball enough, which is what we’ve been doing for the first four games. We’ll pick ourselves up and see what we need to improve.”Smith was involved in the concession of both the goals at Ayr last weekend and has held his hands up for his involvement in Daniel Harvie’s opener and Alan Forrest’s penalty which sealed the points.“They were both straight balls,” he reflected. “The second goal, I’ve given away the penalty so I need to hold my hands up for that.

the imminent closure of Tesco Murraygate leaves a very bad taste in the mouth and will leave #Posted by Councillor John Alexander onFriday,  September The response to Mr Alexander, from Sports Direct, reads: #To confirm, Sports Direct acquired the Murraygate unit occupied by Tesco in November  with the aim of opening new, elevated Sports Direct and USC stores in the town.#Over the last  months, we have been in discussions with Tesco over the future of the store Tesco did not offer terms to renew the lease.#Refurbishment works will begin in December  with the new ,sq ft elevated store set to open in Winter .#This is a major part of Sports Direct’s brand elevation strategy that will see a huge investment in a number of new stores, while upgrading and improving existing sites across the UK.#Mr Alexander goes on to state: #So now I find myself in a position of questioning both Sports Direct and Tesco on what conversations did and did not take place and when issues were known.#Of course, it#s good news that it will have a purpose going forward and will ultimately employ locals but it doesn#t address the issue.It#s all well and good for two international, billion pound companies to say it was the others fault but the reality is,  families will suffer the consequences.#"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Smart meters can remove the hassle of working out how much is owed when they move out of a property and will also help when iding bills amongst flatmates.However, some tenants are hesitant to request a smart meter fitting as they think it is the landlord or letting agentrsquos responsibility. Therefore, itrsquos a good idea to let your tenants know that yoursquore happy for them to have one fitted.Housing associations should provide information to their tenants about the benefits of smart meters, such as the fact that tenants will always know what they are paying for their energy - with a smart meter, they get an easy-to-understand portable display that shows exactly what they are spending in near real time. More transparency around energy usage and costs will help people avoid getting into debt with their energy supplier. The display also shows exactly how much gas and electricity is being used, so tenants will be able to make informed decisions about what appliances might be more costly to use and where they can save both energy and money.Smart meters are a vital investment in the energy infrastructure of Scotland, England and Wales, delivering benefits beyond personal energy savings. And with over . millionalready installed across Great Britain, many letting agents, landlords, housing associations and tenants are already playing their part in helping to create a more sustainable energy system for the future.Getting a smart meter: FAQsIrsquom a landlord or letting agent, can I arrange a smart meter installation Whoever pays the gas and electricity bills can ask for a smart meter to be fitted. If you pay the energy bills for a tenanted property, you can arrange an installation and should speak to the tenant about an appropriate time for the installation.If your tenant pays the bills, you may wish to provide them with information about the benefits of smart meters and let them know that you are happy for them to arrange an installation.How can Housing Associations get involved There are a number of ways in which you can help support this rollout, includingWho installs the smart meter A qualied installer sent by your energy supplier will fit your new smart meter at the time agreed when arranging your installation. They will show you a photo ID card before they start and they will never request or accept financial payment.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB. Smart Energy GB is a government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  If we want to end sectarianism  we must abolish Catholic schools","story":"Glasgow Councilrsquos ban on a number of Loyalist and Republican marches and parades in the city last weekend led not to an outbreak of peace, as had been hoped, but to an angry demonstration in George Square.According to Tom Wood, former Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders police, the scenes of vocerous protest were reminiscent of the gilets jaunes in France, or recent pro-democracy clashes with police in Hong Kong. Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-papers-reveal-people-resolute-determination-journalism-matters","story":"The PapersBBCFour starsPaul EnglishLETrsquoS go for full disclosure.

Still, , souls were lost.The news of that year, of course, was overshadowed by the assassination in the June of  of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and all that came after.It may be hardest for young people, having only ticked off one decade and a bit, but its no easy feat for anyone to imagine le more than  years ago.I though, as I boasted to the teenage pupils, knew someone who had experienced le across  decades, who was a teenager in the s before such things as teenagers had been invented.My Granny Porteous was born in the same month Archduke Ferdinand was shot and she died last week on September , .An astonishing  years old.Granny P would not have called herself astonishing. She would not have been so boastful. She was the kindest of women, never, ever to be heard saying a bad word about anyone.On reaching the grand milestone of  the sure question is \"Whats your secret \" Some centenarians will tell you they like a wee dram a day, others swear by clean living.Ever honest, on her th birthday May Porteous said she had no secret other than \"pure good luck.\" There was a caveat, though, \"walking everywhere and staying active\" was added to the mix.On her th birthday, Granny Porteous was put to work accompanying her family on the piano as they sang her Happy Birthday. That was another remarkable thing, that at  she was still playing the piano, all the music stored in her head and performed with apologies that her fingers were not what they were.Upwards of , its quite fine for knuckles to not behave themselves so well.Granny Porteous married Tom in , a union that lead to four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. A piano and singing teacher, she gave up work to care for Tom until his death in .As well as music, church played a central role in her le, very rarely was Sunday service missed. When she was young she sang in the choir of Wellington Church, in Glasgows Hillhead, taking two trams - even during the blackouts - to make sure she attended.It was a good, decent, generous le full of love for her family.In the deep sadness at losing Granny P is the loss of that generation of our family, the last of our grandparents. My cousins will back me up on this, Im sure: our grans were the benchmark of classic grandmotherliness.On her th birthday, in these pages, I lamented that proper grannies are about to go extinct.At the loss of one more I reflected on that again. The grans I grew up with all, as a matter of course, had the skills we now reserve as kitsch or hipsterish. That my peers consider ironic to learn. My grans could knit, darn and sew .As standard, they could take a pattern and make a dress just as readily as going to the shops. Disposable fashion  No, not after all that effort and certainly not that level of waste - they lived through rationing, you know.Cooking for young women fell out of favour as anti-feminist but these grans could cook and bake, with recipes written on paper, and they would comfort you with food.Any time I visited Granny P the tea and biscuits would be on bone china and cups would rest on saucers. Will a generation of women ever have close cropped perms again  Will they wear pleated skirts, never slacks, on principle I can tell you now that people are very kind to crying strangers. I had hopped in a taxi, full of beans, only to be quietly snfling minutes later as the news of Granny Ps death came in by phone.\"Granny Porteous has died,\" I blubbered at the poor driver. He reached forward, reverentially, to switch off the radio so there might be a respectful silence.I pulled myself together enough to chair a childrens hearing - \"You are a grown woman!\" - but, later that morning in a coffee shop, the question \"Small or large cappuccino \" was too much and the kind barista offered me a wee seat in the staffroom as my chin wobbled.As the news sunk in I thought of how, as well as her loving presence, her memories will be missed. All that history, the personal and the societal.Will my generation become used to living to , I wonder  Super old age is becoming more common. The latest figures show that in  there were  people reaching the age of , up from  in . Will my cousins and I see the world in   Or     I cant imagine it.On thejourney from the school where wed held the hearing, I told a second taxi driver about Granny P. About how she had adored her children and grandchildren and how she had made even those who werent blood relatives feel like kin.\"How old was she \" the driver asked, agog at the answer of . He mulled over how many milestones her le had spanned: two world wars, the moon landings, the national grid bringing electricity into homes. We sat for a while in silence thinking of this arc of history.\",\" he said as I was stepping out. And then he applauded. Quite right.

Her hope that people ldquothink very carefully about the future is sound advice about any subject at anytime. To infer from this some advantage to the pro-UK side of the debate is a strange thought for independence supporters to have given that suggests they are concerned that too much thinking about the future is not good for the cause of separation.Perhaps they are right, but either way, the Queenrsquos comment was fair and little dferent to saying ldquothink carefully and make your own mind up. Those who argue otherwise perhaps reveal they own inclination to have us all adopt their opinion rather than thinking for ourselves.Keith Howell, West Linton.DAVID Boneis wrong to complain that Nicola Sturgeon seizes on any excuse to talk about a second independence referendum the SNP manesto in  clearly stated that there would not be a second referendum, but that was before \"the signicant and material change of circumstance\" which sees Scotland being forced out of the EU against our will.I agree with Mr Bone that the Opposition parties in Scotland are \"unbalanced and ineffectual\" they have nothing fresh to say, tied as they are to their Unionist bosses at Westminster, and they are up against an SNP Government which continues to deliver positive policies for Scotland. Nobody is suggesting perfection, but when Mr Bone writes about an \"SNP-dominated Scotland\" he should remember that the SNP is only dominant in Scotland because the voters have awarded it their trust, voting it into power for a third consecutive term at Holyrood and into first place at the EU elections last May.As for \"Scotlands sensible and stoic past\", I believe I am correct in remembering that in the late s when the very idea of a Scottish Parliament was ridiculed by most Unionists, that the amount of time Westminster devoted to purely Scottish affairs was  hours per year. With the SNP as the third-largest party at Westminster these days are in the past and in the past they must remain Scotland has come a long way with the SNP, and the winning post is in sight.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: David Cameron secretly asked the Queen to back the Union in the  Scottish independence campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-nevis-lit-keep-mountain-peak","story":"A record number of walkers and climbers scaled the UKrsquos highest mountain last year.Overall, an astonishing , people conquered the Ben in , according to figures from the charity which manages the ,ft Highland peak.On the busiest days, more than , hikers, runners and charity racers trekked to the summit ndash leading to ldquolong tailbacks at certain points on the main path.Now up to  walkers will scale the peak at night tomorrow to raise money for the Nevis Fund, which is administered by the Nevis Landscape Partnership, with music, poetry and light to add to the experience.: Ben Nevis tragedy climber: \"I wish we had not done that climb\"The Nevis Landscape Partnership is a collective of environmental organisations, local and national, working together to protect and enhance the land of and surrounding Ben Nevis.Among those benefiting will be Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, who carry out around  rescues on the Ben each year.The event has been organised by well-known mountain guide Mike Pescod of Abacus Mountain Guides.Mr Pescod said that around pound, had been spent on repairing the bottom end of the path in recent years but that money had now come to an end.ldquoThere is no central regular fund for maintenance of the path and it is getting busier and busier.

None more so than in the ways by which news, whether domestic or international, is obtained and disseminated.The challenge facing the newspaper industry was brought home clearly in the programme with editors balancing print and digital output. The reliance on freelance contributors was a further indication of the reduction in the numbers of those employed directly in the industry and it was clear that the remaining permanent staff were skilled at performing many roles. It was a sign of the times that the Editor-in-chief, Donald Martin, was responsible for overseeing the production of three titles.While the time honoured expression ldquoHold the front page was not recorded, it was clear that the pressure to produce a topical front page in time to meet the production deadline is just as much to the fore as in times past.There seemed little scope for pursuing investigative journalism given the reduced level of funding, though it is possible that this aspect of journalism may be covered in the next episode.In a changing world, the programme provided a valuable insight into how the newspaper industry is, of necessity, adapting to the ways in which we communicate.It emphasised the responsibility which journalists have to maintain the high level of integrity in the industry in the face of others who would attempt to undermine the trust of readers through their attempts to spread ldquofake news.Malcolm Allan, BishopbriggsIrsquove signed up and subscribed to Herald Scotland this morning as a direct result of the first episode of The Papers documentary, which I thought was fantastic.I have been takingnews for free for years ndash but the programme made me clearly and deeply understand the importance of impartial newsand the thought of losing this vitally important voice and resource would be incredibly damaging.

Therersquos been a reason for all the hectic work, though the Global Strike for Climate. Wersquove been putting huge amounts of effort into this vastly important strike. Millions of people are gathering across the world to protest Government inaction on climate change.The Global Strike for Climate is our biggest demonstration yet. Itrsquos unique in that wersquove asked adults to join us in demanding action. Today people of all ages and all backgrounds are uniting against climate change, and itrsquos going to be a day of historic proportions. Itrsquos crucial that we send a clear message to the Government that caring about the environment isnrsquot some sort of trendy fad exclusive to young people- itrsquos a huge issue which everyone should care about, since it will affect all of us. We must show those at the top that wersquore not going to just go away, since the climate crisis isnrsquot just going to disappear either. Like us, itrsquos effects will only grow stronger and stronger. In the future, climate change will not go unnoticed, and so we canrsquot afford to let it go unnoticed while we still have the chance to do something.People around the globe are already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis right now, just look at the devastating impacts of hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and the countless awful natural disasters that wersquove seen just like it. Climate change is here and now, and the Global Strike is a chance for all of us to demand the government to stop perceiving it as some far-off threat for the far down the line.This issue is both amazingly simple and infinitely complex.

The loss of forest, habitat and wildle is shocking to witness. In Scotland, as in the Amazon, a great forest has been here before but has now gone after centuries of use, depleted until the final old trees decline and fall. Across the Scottish Highlands, over many centuries, grazing by goats, sheep, cattle and wild deer along with felling for timber and farmland, has removed this precious woodland from the hills of Scotland. We need that great forest again ndash now more than ever. Capturing carbon, helping community resilience, reducing flooding risk, improving soils, nurturing bioersity and offering a wonderland for people to explore ndash these are some of the benefits that a rewilded Caledonian Forest can bring.While human activity has been the cause of the loss of so much forest in Scotland and around the world, people are vital to its future. Much of the work Trees for Le has done so far has been with the help of thousands of volunteers who have joined us toforest to remote mountains. As we work in more places at a bigger scale we know that landowners, local communities and businesses need to thrive alongside the wild forest. This means working together to strike the right balance between a forest that can take care of itself and humans being able to make a living from it. The Trees for Le vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildle to flourish and communities to thrive.We welcome action that shines a light on the climate crisis. It is time for those who hold power, from landowners to Governments, to act on what the science has been telling us for decades. We believe that rewilding answers many of the urgent questions climate change is asking. We also recognise it is not the only solution. A mix of solutions is requiredwe are to reverse the effects of humankindrsquos damage to the environment.Scotland was the first country in the world to declare a climate emergency. As a nation leading this agenda we must recognise the time for discussion and debate is over. The solutions to reverse the effects of climate change are available now. Our children are asking for action now. We must respond with action now.bull Steve Micklewright is CEO of Trees for Le:CLAIRE MACKWith some of the planetrsquos most ambitious renewable energy and carbon targets, Scotland is already a world leader on climate action.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival, which is underway right now , is highlighting our industryrsquos successes to date and our ambitious plans for the future.The announcement earlier this month that the UNrsquos th climate change conference is coming to Glasgow in  gives us a new opportunity, too.Itrsquos an opportunity to make Scotland one of the most climate-savvy nations on Earth.And thatrsquos an opportunity with energy at its heart.Globally, the energy industry is on a multi-trillion dollar journey to decarbonisation, but the production of energy is still one of the largest sources of the carbon emissions which are damaging our planet.Yes, Scotlandrsquos electricity sector no longer belches smoke skywards, and this is certainly something to be proud of.But heat makes up almost double the carbon emissions of electricity. We havenrsquot even scratched the surface of decarbonising it.Transport, too, is a huge issue, and one which can only be resolvedthe public changes the habits of a letime.Those of us who drive a petrol car know its emissions are an issue. But the excuses for choosing fossil fuel over an electric vehicle are all too easy to come up with.And itrsquos the same for heat. When your boiler breaks down, would you be willing to pay more in the short-term for a heat pump, or connect to a district heating network Again, the excuses are many: the short-term costs are too high. The long-term benefits of these choices are too distant. Itrsquos easier to stick our heads in the sand.But therersquos only so long we can ignore the truth: climate change is a threat multiplier.A poll this week found climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy.Therersquos no more important aspect of our lives to rethink than how we, personally, tackle it.Todayrsquosprotests are part of that story, but so too are the energy industryrsquos actions.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival is an opportunity to look forward, past COP and medium-term targets, to a low-carbon energy system with renewables at its heart.Irsquom proud that my industry is doing so much to achieve that vision, and heartened that so many people share it.bull Claire Mack, is Chief Executive at Scottish Renewables: The full list of climate strikes taking place across ScotlandMARK RUSKELLThis week the figurehead of the climate strikers, Greta Thunberg, was in front of US Congress.ldquoI donrsquot want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists, she told US lawmakers.Instead of a written submission, the Swedish teenager handed over the landmark IPCC report, published last year, which gives governments only a decade to slow global warming.That stark warning, based on scientic evidence and which governments signed up to, is what our young people are articulating through direct action today.Thousands of Scottish children and young people share Gretarsquos message. They are telling us to look at the scientic evidence which tells us that the majority of fossil fuels must be left in the ground. They are telling us to plant more trees and save endangered species. They are telling us to get on with it, fast.The Scottish Government claim to be listening to them, butwe look at what our leaders are actually offering in , it seems to me that the message is just not getting through.For example, Nicola Sturgeon likes to talk about Scotlandrsquos lsquoworld-leading targetsrsquo to reduce emissions. But the timescale bares little resemblance to the ten years the IPCC gives us for meaningful change. By the time we meet the net-zero target of , the IPCCrsquos point of nowill be  years old. Greta Thunberg will be .I will be putting forward an amendment to the Scottish Governmentrsquos climate bill which will see an % reduction in emissions by the IPCCrsquos deadline, and I hope that every MSP will put our common future first and back it.But targets arenrsquot enough. Indeed, Scotland missed its existing emissions targets last year.Ultimately, itrsquos action that counts. Bold, ambitious action like a nation-wide programme of works to make every home in Scotland warm, efficient and low carbon, shting billions out of new motorways and into public transport up so people donrsquot need to rely on cars, and reforesting Scotland up to at least the European average.My fear is that this message has not got through to the majority of politicians in Holyrood and around the world. Rhetoric and eye-catching targets will not meet the demands of young people. Next weekrsquos vote on the climate bill must mark the beginning of transformative change.Like Greta told Congress, our young people are telling the UK and Scottish Governments: ldquoYoursquore not trying hard enough.bull Mark Ruskell is MSP for Mid Scotland and FeDR RICHARD DIXONWhen I met -year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg briefly at the climate summit in Katowice in Poland last year I thanked her for all she was doing to bring attention to the need for more climate action. At that point she had been holding her own personal climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament for five months. This had sparked a global movement of school children striking for the climate and, already on her meteoric rise to global prominence, she at the climate conference to give a speech in front of the UN Secretary General.Of course since then she has spoken at the World Economic Forum, in front of huge crowds in a number of languages and to EU leaders. And she has just sailed across an ocean so she can speak at the UN climate summit in New York next week. Politicians who care about climate change are queuing up to be seen with her and last week she was protesting outside the White House with thousands of US students.The movement she started has gone from strength to strength, becoming the largest youth-led movement ever. There have been school strikes across the world and a week of action starts today with millions of people ndash children and adults this time - expected to take part in thousands of marches, rallies and strikes in  countries.Today there will be climate strikes in at least  places in Scotland, including marches with thousands of people expected in Edinburgh and Glasgow.Irsquove been outside Parliament several times to see the climate strikes including the two very impressive big rallies, one where about , young people came and went over a number of hours. The children had organised all this themselves.Over the last decade Irsquove mostly found the speeches at rallies and marches rather dull ndash even when itrsquos me giving the speech! But the children outside Parliament gave speech after speech that was really worth listening to.Irsquoll be there again today because it is really inspiring and heart-warming to see young people and their supporters taking action in such huge numbers on climate change.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart.

Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  .

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set.

She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron says he faced ira members during stormont negotiations in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It becomes a problem when someone decides they know everything about you just because theyre in possession of a few factlets.The Troubles produced many bad people. In due course, they had children of their own. It really shouldnt come as a shock that some of them took radically dferent paths, certainly not to anyone whos had children of their own.It would be an awful world in which children turned into carbon copies of their mothers and fathers.If Chloe was to defend her fathers paramilitary past, then it would be perfectly justied to criticise her for it. The same would applyshe used her social media  to spread hate or ision. But she doesnt. She posts harmless messages about fashion. Pictures of her parents must rouse dark memories to those whose lives were touched by Johnny Adair but its he who must answer for his crimes, not his daughter.That Chloe has forged her own way in le, independent of her parentage, ought to be seen as an achievement, rather than a puzzle. If anything, she is now the positive role model that he failed to be in his own le.Children should never be judged by the sins of their parents, but they can sometimes put right a few of those sins by rejecting the toxic example theyve been given and going on to live better, more productive lives."},{"url":null,"title":"eu insists on fully workable solution to irish border in brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Given the crisis in third-level education in the North West, and the need for the region to entrust its educational provision in the hands of those who will take it seriously, what other providers partners has Derry Strabane council approached as regards developing HE provision in the North West googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs an interim measure, we call on Derry Strabane council to establish a dedicated Higher Education Development  Scrutiny Committee immediately.This committee must meet urgently with the National University of Ireland, Letterkenny IT and the NW Regional College, as it draws up a strategic plan for a new, independent cross-border university.It must also liaise directly, and urgently, with Donegal County Council and the governments in London, Dublin and Brussels to discuss funding opportunities and administrative alignments.There is no time to be lost. These arrangements cannot wait for the re-establishment of Stormont or the settling of Brexit. This is much too important an issue.The momentum is with the North West and with the campaign for an independent university."},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"food festival leaves newtown smiling","story":"Saxophone Sundae entertains festival goers at this years Newtown Food Festival. ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtPicture: Rob Davieslt spangtlt spangt\" Food festival leaves town smilingThree cyclist from Hafren Cycle Club who wil be competing in the Chrono des Natiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtons in Les Herbiers ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtVendeacutee meet members from the twining association at this years Newtown Food Festival.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
