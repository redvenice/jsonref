But the UKHSA has noted a small number of people who have been reinfected with BA.2 after recovering from Omicron. Other studies have pointed to the subvariant being significantly more immune-resistant than the original Omicron, which would make it easier to infect vaccinated or previously infected people.  Whitehall sources told The Times earlier this week that they had not seen any evidence of significant changes in behaviour. But Government adviser Professor Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist on SAGE, told MailOnline that there was a growing impression that Covid is \u0027yesterday\u0027s news\u0027 and causing people to be more lax.He claimed that even people who wanted to take precautions were being forced into more risky behaviours because the majority of restrictions have been lifted. But a number of experts, including Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, believe the uptick in cases and hospital admissions is the early sign of waning booster immunity.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended fourth doses to the most vulnerable age groups this spring, telling ministers they should be dished out around six months after their last vaccine. JCVI advisers originally recommended third doses on September 14, with over-75s, care home residents and patients with serious underlying health conditions first in the queue. Pfizer\u0027s booster drops from 90 per cent effectiveness against severe disease from Omicron to around 75 per cent after 10 weeks, according to the latest data. "},{"url":null,"title":"Adnan Syed scores legal win evidence tested DNA","story":"Share this articleBaltimore Sun - We are currently unavailable in your regionMaryland Requests New DNA Testing on Evidence in Hae Min Lee\u0027s Murder Case | PEOPLE.com"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: In 1850, as famine raged, Captain Houstoun asked Lord Sligo of Westport if he knew of any land that could carry 10,000 sheepStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord uncharted territory for 21st century europe","story":"Amnesty supporters hold a vigil to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine in Dublin city centre on Thursday evening.  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw “We will prevail.”In case anyone needs reminding, this Saturday, March 12th, marks two years to the day since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Blair House in icy, pre-dawn Washington DC and addressed the nation.It was still early back home in Ireland. The then taoiseach’s speech was going out live to an anxious nation. Nobody knew what might happen. What would he say?And so he began. Those famous opening words: “Good morning, everyone. I need to speak to you about coronavirus and Covid-19.”Remember this? “We have not witnessed a pandemic of this nature in living memory. This is uncharted territory. We said we would take the right actions at the right time.“We have to move now to have the greatest impact.“So, from 6pm today, the following measures are being put in place. They will stay in place until March 29th . . .”That was when our world changed.“There will be many more cases. More people will get sick and unfortunately, we must face the tragic reality that some people will die.“The virus is all over the world. It will continue to spread but it can be slowed. Its impact can be reduced making it easier for our health service to cope and giving our scientists more time to develop better testing, treatments and a vaccine.”This situation was unimaginable, hard to take in. Back home, bizarrely, the initial, panicked reaction of large swathes of the population was to rush out to the supermarket and buy vast quantities of toilet roll. Some feared this might be the beginning of the end of the world.“I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it is going involve big changes in the way we live our lives. I know that I am asking people to make enormous sacrifices.“We are doing it for each other.“Together, we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back.“Acting together, as one nation, we can save many lives.“Our economy will suffer. It will bounce back.“Lost time in school or college will be recovered. In time, our lives will go back to normal.“Above all, we all need to look out for each other.“Ireland is a great nation. And we are great people. We have experienced hardship and struggle before. We have overcome many trials in the past with our determination and our spirit.“We will prevail.”The then taoiseach was right. We did (or at least most of us did) pull together. People suffered. The economy suffered. But we did slow the virus and we did push it back.It took two long, long years but finally we began to emerge from beneath the shadow of Covid-19. The suffering had eased. The economy was bouncing back.Just two weeks ago, the mandatory requirement to wear face masks was lifted.Then Russia invaded Ukraine. Now war rages in Europe with unspeakable terror prosecuted by despot Vladimir Putin. He is the virus now.Many are dying. Millions are displaced amid scenes of carnage and upheaval not witnessed since the second World War. Uncharted territory for 21st-century Europe.Inflation is rising. The economy is suffering. People are suffering. We are frightened for the future. Refugees will arrive in their thousands – we will look out for them and we will look out for each other.Some fear this might be the beginning of the end of the world. Another, darker, shadow has settled over us.The then taoiseach’s words from two years ago have renewed meaning.“We will prevail.”For we must prevail. Again.Coffee and solidarity for UkraineBefore Leaders’ Questions started on Wednesday, the Ceann Comhairle paid tribute to Independent Senator Sharon Keogan for organising “an excellent, splendid and extraordinary event in support of the Irish Red Cross’s endeavours in Ukraine”.Ukrainian ambassador Larysa Gerasko was guest of honour at the coffee morning. “Not only was there a huge number of members of the parliamentary community present, but 35 embassies were also represented in a phenomenal international display of support. Fair play to Senator Keogan,” said Seán Ó Fearghaíl.Ambassadors from Turkey, Korea, Cyprus, Singapore, Vatican City, the Philippines, Jamaica, Colombia, Spain, Czech Republic, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, Iceland, Portugal, Georgia, Norway, Indonesia, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands, Australia, Estonia, Latvia, Israel, Greece, Lesotho, Brazil, Finland, New Zealand, Lithuania, Guatemala, Slovakia and Kenya showed up to show solidarity with their colleague from Ukraine and her compatriots.They were joined by members of the Dáil and Seanad, along with representatives of the Irish Red Cross and the Irish League of Credit Unions. Oireachtas staff also contributed to the collection which brought in €14,000 in a couple of hours, the biggest amount ever raised at a single event in Leinster House.Senator Keoghan and a small team of volunteers put the fundraiser together in just four days. She told the guest of honour: “We want to let you know, we stand with you and we will not leave you wanting for whatever you may need in the coming months and years. You are showing true leadership and support to your fellow Ukrainians here in Ireland and those who we are currently welcoming to our shores.”There was a poignant moment before proceedings began when Gerasko met her Polish counterpart Anna Sochanska in an anteroom. They talked quietly to each other, holding hands as they spoke.The Irish Red Cross will administer the funds and its chairman, former minister Pat Carey, was in attendance along with the president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, Helene McManus. She launched a new grassroots fundraising drive for credit union members across Ireland who want to donate to the appeal.It was quiet occasion. Gerasko addressed the gathering – exhausted, emotional, but so very strong.He mightn’t have been the best minister for housing the country has seen (although it’s a very crowded field), but nuclear disarmament expert Eoghan Murphy’s particular skill set is very relevant in these dangerous times.The former TD for Dublin Bay South was promoted to cabinet by Leo Varadkar when he became taoiseach in 2017, but Murphy had a turbulent time in office. He returned to the backbenches after the 2020 election and sensationally quit the Dáil last April.He said at the time he was resigning his seat “not to leave politics entirely, but to pursue a career in the area of international co-operation, human rights and democracy”.Before he went into politics, Varadkar loyalist Murphy worked for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation in Vienna and at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. After he jumped ship – Fine Gael lost his seat in the subsequent byelection to now Labour Party leadership favourite Ivana Bacik – he went to work for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), heading up election observation missions.Last reported sightings of Murph were in Uzbekistan and Armenia.Dublin Bay South’s lively Fine Gael ghetto is awash with talk of how former minister Murphy has not been pressed into action by the Government to utilise his undoubted expertise in international arms control. We presume close pal Leo has been in touch for advice.FF duo’s secret missionThe communications system crashed in Leinster House on Wednesday, with alarmed TDs and Senators reporting they could no longer use phones and email. Politicians immediately suspected Russian interference.Some wondered if it was an act of reprisal following that daring cross-border mission into Ukraine at the weekend by two of Fianna Fáil’s finest (MEP Billy Kelleher and Senator Timmy Dooley). However, this was not retaliation for Bimmy and Tilly’s courageous incursion – it was just a power cut.The last thing viewers expected to see on the nine o’clock news on Sunday night was the pair of them holding forth to reporter Paul Cunningham from a floodlit crossing on the Polish-Ukrainian border. It came as a surprise to the RTÉ man too, who had been filming elsewhere when he got word earlier in the day that Bimmy and Tilly (bosom buddies back in their Dáil days) were on their way back to the Medyka crossing having met political leaders in Lviv.The Irish politicians were transported to and from the border by Ukrainian colleagues who were able to bypass the 20km-long traffic tailback on the Ukraine side. Senator Dooley is vice-president of the EU political grouping ALDE and he explained they had been invited by president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Ukrainian People’s Party.Cunningham asked why they couldn’t have met remotely rather than undertaking the journey to Lviv. “I think that showed we were really serious about helping them. They invited us. They wanted us to come. I think from their perspective it showed that we were committed to working with them,” he replied.The two Fianna Fáil stalwarts embarked on their mission without informing party leader Micheál Martin as they were essentially on ALDE business.The episode wasn’t exactly met with universal acclaim in Leinster House, where certain politicians just couldn’t resist the obvious riposte when asked about our intrepid duo’s brief fact-finding foray into the war-torn country.“Have they not suffered enough?”"},{"url":null,"title":"public mood plummets as prices at pumps soar","story":"Petrol pump politics have returned as a central feature in domestic political discourse over the past 18 months as energy prices have risen. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillLike many things these days, a reliable weathervane of public mood on energy prices is WhatsApp postings.There are scores of photographs of filling station signs shared on groups showing the price of petrol and diesel overshooting the symbolic €2 per litre mark.In a widely circulated mock-up picture a woman admires a man’s scent and says: “That smells expensive, what is it?” He replies: “Petrol.”And, of course, there are plenty of mugshots too of the villains with caustic comments accompanying them. No, not Vladimir Putin in this instance. Rather it’s the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and, especially, Minister for Energy Eamon Ryan.“People are obviously aware these events are outside the control of the Government,” says political scientist Dr Maurice Manning, referring to the impact an energy crisis will have on domestic politics. “If there is a generalised feeling of discontent and distemper, and people are not generally feeling good, these just feed into an anti-government feeling.“People who are not happy with the Government will become even more unhappy. Those who were wavering can get caught up in the mood. This is the main thing that governments have to fear, that it changes the mood.”Indeed, the public mood has taken a sharp downward dip in the past week as pump prices spiralled, as we have seen a relatively modern phenomenon in Irish politics – petrol pump politics – kick in.It is not without precedent. The oil crisis of 1973 and 1974, which had its beginnings in the Yom Kippur war, led to oil shortages and a marked drop in living standards in Ireland, exacerbating existing problems including rampant inflation.It led to long queues at petrol pumps and two years of economic hardship. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition took a big political hit from which it never fully recovered. The Minister for Misery caricature in the satirical Hall’s Pictorial Weekly TV series captured the public sentiment.There was a further oil crisis in 1979 caused by the shocks of the Iranian revolution. The resultant rationing pummelled the reputation of already beleaguered Fianna Fáil taoiseach Jack Lynch.Petrol pump politics have returned as a central feature in domestic political discourse over the past 18 months as energy prices have risen. Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman, Pearse Doherty, has been delivering weekly brimstone and fury, particularly targeting the carbon tax.The criticism is undoubtedly populist but not without substance. With such a dispersed population and disjointed transport system, a high proportion of the population remain car-dependent.Lisa Ryan, professor in energy economics at UCD, says Ireland’s starting point is not ideal as it is one of the most import-dependent economies in Europe. After Covid, the volumes of imports are increasing. At the same time, across the board, the price of gas, oil and coal have all risen dramatically.“Half of our electricity is based on natural gas and we are trying to get away from coal and increase our renewables,” she says.“The target for renewables is 80 per cent by 2030. We need to accelerate that.”She says gas is meant to provide flexibility in our energy systems (such as when winds are calm) but is being used as a base load.“The other problem is transport: 25 per cent of all oil comes from Russia and the Urals. That’s why oil prices have dramatically increased.”Ryan says the crises of the 1970s resulted in reducing car journeys and an increase in fuel efficiency. But this is harder to achieve in Ireland where people are very reliant on private cars, particularly in rural areas with dispersed populations, she adds.What is happening is a perfect storm, says Ryan. She says during the height of Covid there was a drop in demand for fuel, and the Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) group of oil-producing countries reduced production to maintain prices. Post-Covid demand is higher but Opec has not yet met targets to increase supply and there is a shortfall, she says.However, she says the International Energy Agency believes oil supply will increase to be above demand by the end of the year, which should help resolve the issue.Ireland is only 3 per cent reliant on Russian gas compared with Germany, which is 80 per cent reliant. Most gas in Ireland originates from Norway and comes through the UK.Long term, Ryan believes we have to push for alternatives, primarily wind renewables. She says she is stating the obvious when she describes it as “enormously challenging”.Now there is an immediate threat. The Minister in the eye of the storm, Eamon Ryan, sees the same patterns now as occurred during the previous oil crises with geopolitical issues driving up prices.“There is a similar question now. Everybody agrees we need to est from fossil fuels, from Russian oil and gas particularly.”He argues the Government’s approach is two-pronged. He says it has already taken immediate measures to protect the short-term impacts, particularly around price.“We will follow that up in a few weeks with further efficiency measures.”Long term, he argues, the best protection against future shocks is to use less. “We need to switch from oil to accelerate the development of offshore renewables, retrofitting and district heating plants.“We should not give false expectations that we can cover all of the increased cost,” he adds.Carbon tax can’t be revisited. His stance is that its cost is only 5c a day for heating oil. “It would not be right to upend a socially progressive measure that is working well and combats the climate challenge. We would be giving up a very important tool.”The Opposition and many motorists don’t see it that way. The next increase in carbon tax will undoubtedly lead to renewed criticism of the Government, the Greens and of Ryan.Manning characterises the political difficulty. “The Government is caught at both ends. It has less money to spend. It is obliged to spend what little money it has to try to alleviate something it can’t really have any radical approach to as it is not in a position to change any of the geopolitical factors that are causing all of this.“Yet a lot of people who were not well disposed in the first place are now ill disposed towards them.”He sees this as a critical moment. “I think the crisis we are in at the moment is probably more dangerous because we may be only at the beginning of a long period of uncertainty to put it at its mildest.”Full coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"putin could removed power would replace","story":"Vladimir Putin is in for the fight of his life. His brutal and ill-conceived war in Ukraine, a personal crusade he has foisted on his country, has left his army mired abroad and an economy reeling under unprecedented Western sanctions at home. For 22 years he was the one constant of Russian politics, but no wonder people are thinking much more sharply not only about a Russia after Putin, but how that may be brought about.After all, who would have thought that a country so deeply embedded in the global economic system could so quickly be disconnected from so much of it? That a country with notionally more than half a trillion pounds in its foreign reserves would be debating emergency price regulation for medicines, basic foods and baby products. That a military machine in which Putin has invested so much for so long could stumble and fall as soon as it steps into neighbouring Ukraine.Indeed, on Monday, Putin, the man who four days before had vowed to destroy “this ‘Anti-Russia’ created by the West”, signalled that he was willing to cut his losses. The terms he offered Kyiv were still unrealistic and unacceptable, but having previously indicated that he wanted to take the whole country – to, as he put it, “denazify” it – now he is only seeking Crimea and the south-eastern Donbas region. Of course, at the same time he is escalating the brutality of the onslaught, hoping to negotiate from a position of strength, having taken more cities. However, it reflects the way that even this most out-of-touch of leaders is aware that this debacle threatens him and his regime. In a system which has become so personalised and authoritarian, though, the usual mechanisms for the transfer of power do not apply. It may therefore be more out of hope than anything else that there are those in Russia and beyond wondering if mortality will do the job. Rumours are multiplying. Might his strange terror of infection – never mind those comically long tables, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro apparently had to take five Covid tests to be able to shake his hand – be a sign he is suffering from a disease weakening his immune system? Footage of a trembling hand might indicate Parkinson’s. The puffiness of his face could be a sign of steroid treatment. Illness or a sense of impending mortality might help explain his splenetic new moods, and why a leader who in the past was much more cautious than his macho persona would suggest, now seems to be an angry old man in a hurry. Barring any such deus ex machina, it is hard to see him standing down voluntarily. He periodically toyed with handing the presidency to a successor, perhaps retaining some “father of the nation” role. However, in a system where politics trumps law, that means putting yourself at another’s mercy, and Putin is not a man who trusts easily at the best of times. Besides, he is clearly obsessed with his place in history – he could only step down on a high, and it is hard to see any triumphs in his future. In theory, Putin could be removed through the constitution. Article 93 allows for impeachment on the basis of serious crimes. Yet that requires not only a two-thirds vote in both chambers of parliament, but also the consent of the Constitutional and Supreme Courts. All have been packed with loyalists, and even if these opportunists thought that they were being led to destruction, it is almost impossible to see any kind of conspiracy being organised without it coming to the Kremlin’s attention. After all, not only is the much-feared Federal Security Service (FSB) tasked with watching the elite, but so too is the more secretive Federal Protection Service (FSO). Better known for the colourfully-uniformed Kremlin guards and Putin’s black-suited and earpiece-wearing personal security detail, every morning the FSO submits to the president a dossier on what is going on within the elite, based on agents, informants and phone taps. It must make for interesting reading, these days.The most extreme option some in the West are openly discussing is the prospect of outright assassination. This is highly unlikely, not least because the security precautions around “the Body”, as Putin is known by his security detail, are massive, complex and comprehensive to the point of paranoia. He rarely travels much these days anyway, except between his palaces and the Kremlin, and then in the presidential aircraft or an armoured Aurus Kortezh limo escorted by a huge motorcade with motorcycle outriders, vans full of heavily-armed FSO officers, an ambulance and an electronic warfare vehicle to jam any bomb detonators along the route and ert drones. Like a medieval monarch, he retains a food taster, and even the air in his palaces is constantly monitored for pathogens and poisons.Tsar Nicholas II was infamously murdered by the Bolsheviks, but only after they had seized him and his family. The last Russian ruler who fell to an assassin was Tsar Alexander II, over 140 years ago and the FSO has no intention of letting any re-runs happen on their watch. Where precision is impossible, what about brute force? It is a mark of the times that rumours – seemingly wholly fanciful – have been circulating that defence minister Sergei Shoigu is under suspicion of planning a coup. Certainly the only institutions which would seem able to oust Putin in a coup would be either the security agencies or, more plausibly, the army. The military have two elite isions outside Moscow, the 4th Guards “Kantemirovskaya” Tank Division and the 2nd Guards “Tamanskaya” Mechanised Division, as well as two Spetsnaz special forces units close by. However, not only are they carefully watched by the FSB’s military counter-intelligence department, one of whose primary roles is to sniff out potential disloyalty, but they also face a series of other units in Moscow. The National Guard, a parallel internal security army under former Putin bodyguard and arch-loyalist Viktor Zolotov has the oversized 1st Independent Special Designation Division based in the east of the city. They have their own tanks, artillery and anti-tank missiles, making it pretty clear that their role is, if necessary, to take on the military.Meanwhile, if that were not enough, the FSO’s Kremlin Regiment may be better known for the ramrod-stiff soldiers standing watch over the Eternal Flame just outside the fortress’s walls, but in crisis would exchange their pretty red-and-blue uniforms and ceremonial bolt-action rifles for camouflage and AK-74 assault rifles. There are 5,500 of them, hand-picked for their loyalty as much as their martial skills. In short, any attempt by the military alone to seize power and topple Putin could be a dangerous and messy venture, potentially leading to open warfare in Moscow’s streets.If mortality, muscle or machination do see Putin leave power, though, who might succeed him? It would probably be a technocrat, a strongman or a proxy.The constitution says that the prime minister steps in first as interim president before elections are held. Current incumbent Mikhail Mishustin is a former head of the Federal Tax Service. He has been in office since January 2020, and so his tenure has been under the shadow of Covid. Nonetheless, unlike his predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev, he has already managed to create the image of the no-nonsense and hard-headed manager. He also has just enough of a personal life to give the spin doctors something to craft a narrative around him. He plays ice hockey and the piano and has even written songs for Grigory Leps, a gravelly-voiced pop star sanctioned by the US government for alleged mafia connections.The 56-year-old Mishustin could be the obvious choice for a technocratic successor, but he has not yet been at the centre of power long enough to build himself a network of clients and allies. Other figures such as Moscow’s well-regarded mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, might also be in with a chance. More to the point, it would be hard to see a managerial candidate actually being able to bring down Putin. Their chance would only come if someone or something else opened the door for them.Someone like defence minister Shoigu might actually be able to kick that door open for himself. He is not by background a military man. He was a civil engineer who then became the emergencies minister in the 1990s, a job which for many would have been the kiss of death, making him responsible for every natural or man-made disaster in that unruly decade. Yet he made a virtue of necessity and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get involved in anything, from comforting relatives to digging through rubble, actually made him a national figure.Shoigu also made the emergencies ministry, originally a dysfunctional a collection of agencies, one of the most efficient, trusted and even honest government departments in Russia. Appointed to head a ided and disgruntled defence ministry in 2012, Shoigu again was able to push forward reform and win the loyalty of soldiers and generals alike. This is, after all, a man with a unique political touch. Not only is he the only figure to make his way into Putin’s inner circle without having been a long-term friend from the KGB or Putin’s time in St Petersburg, he has also managed to rise within the carnivorous world of Russian politics without apparently making blood enemies on the way. Shoigu might be the kind of savvy strongman at once able to wield the muscle to topple Putin and also the political skills to reassure the rest of the elite. Other key figures within the security apparatus, such as FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov or National Guard commander Zolotov, are too closely linked to Putin and too mistrusted to be credible candidates.For all his current role in the Ukraine war, Shoigu appears to be a pragmatic kind of nationalist. Pervasive rumours suggest he was the only member of Putin’s inner circle not to support the annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, if experience of other coups is anything to go by, it is often the case that the initiator does not get to enjoy power long term. It may be that the 66-year-old Shoigu would simply be a transitional figure, who sweeps away the worst of Putinism, and sets the scene for the next generation of leaders.In theory, that could include the 56-year-old Medvedev, the only modern Russian politician to have been both prime minister and president. He was only president as Putin’s front man and chair-warmer, though, for the period 2008-12, while his boss governed from the prime minister’s office as a way to get round term limits. He does not strike an impressive figure, though. Of late, Medvedev, who holds an honorific but essentially meaningless position as deputy chairman of the Security Council, has been trying to reinvent himself as a hawk, taking extreme positions on everything from the death penalty to seizing the assets of companies leaving Russia. Nonetheless, he is now something of a laughing stock. In 2016, opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s followers starting using yellow rubber ducks as a light-hearted symbol of protest after he revealed that Medvedev’s “summer house” was actually a sumptuously-renovated 18th-century palace with an extravagant duck house on a lake.Medvedev could conceivably be president again, but only as a proxy, if a collection of powerful figures – none powerful enough to seize the presidency for themselves – want a front man they do not have to fear.In any case, whoever succeeds Putin is likely to have to be a different and even transitional figure, shaped not just by the hard times facing Russia but also the rising political generation. Putin is 69, and most of his close allies are the same age or older. They are in many ways the last of the true Soviet elite.Beneath them, increasingly impatient at an older generation that still seems intent on replaying the Cold War, and squandering their future in the process, is a rather different cohort of officials and businesspeople in their 50s and early 60s. They are by no means democrats, and can be every bit as hard-nosed as their seniors. However, in my experience at least, they lack the venomous and vindictive passion for Russia’s struggle with the West evident in Putin and people like his Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev and the FSB’s Bortnikov, both 70 years old.This younger generation is made up of, to be blunt, pragmatic kleptocrats. They hanker after the good old days of the 2000s, when they were free to embezzle at home on an industrial scale, yet spend and bank that money in the West without fear of sanctions, asset freezes and Swift bans. They may not dare to turn against Putin now, as their fortunes and freedom are in his hands, but they are unlikely to want to continue his crusade against the West if they can possibly avoid it.All of which is why the West must be careful and clever. With our screens darkened with terrible images of a maternity hospital shelled and Mariupol being starved into submission, it is only human that people have begun suggesting that something ought to be done to try to topple Putin’s regime or even remove him. This is understandable – but inadvisable.First of all, if you come at the tsar, you best not miss. Assassination or regime change by covert action have a pretty poor track record. The CIA came up with, or launched, 638 separate attempts to kill Cuba’s Fidel Castro, yet he still died of natural causes aged 90, after 52 years in power.Directly targeting Putin and failing would set a dangerous precedent and trigger retaliation. How would our MPs and senior civil servants enjoy having to check their door handles for Novichok every time they got home? Even a successful assassination would likely anger Russians from across the political spectrum and make it harder for a successor to roll back his aggressive policies and improve relations with the West.For moment, then, it looks as if both we and the Russians are stuck with Putin. But in war, things can change quickly. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 was meant to be a “nice, victorious little war” in the words of interior minister Vyacheslav von Plehve, to demonstrate Russia’s strength to the world and restore public morale. As it was, a dismal and embarrassing defeat sparked the unsuccessful 1905 revolution. Likewise, the economic crisis and horrifying losses Russia endured in the First World War led to growing unrest that drove the elite to force the tsar to abdicate. The Soviet war in Afghanistan of 1979-89, a war the Kremlin at first tried to pretend wasn’t even happening, didn’t bring down the regime but did become a metaphor for all the other things wrong with an economically-stagnant, mismanaged and corrupt regime.Already, critical voices are even being heard on TV programmes that usually deliver nothing less than undiluted state propaganda. Guests on the primetime show hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, sanctioned for his role as a Kremlin mouthpiece, drew direct comparisons with Afghanistan and warned that public opinion could quickly change. Meanwhile, on the army’s own TV channel, Zvezda, a serving officer, pushed home the scale of casualties. In both cases, the naysayers were shouted down – the Zvezda presenter insisted that “our guys are smashing the fascist snakes” – but it is unprecedented for such views to be aired on state television, and a sign of the growing mood of dissatisfaction.History is no map of the future, but it does remind us of how war can change everything. It may seem almost inconceivable that Putin’s reign could end any day soon, but now he has made an all-out gamble on war in Ukraine, all bets are off.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv braces for onslaught as Russian forces encircle cityUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russian troops \u0026#39kidnap\u0026#39 Melitopol mayorWestminster holds weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meeting for first time in historyBillionaire ‘Tyrant’ unveils collection of coins minted by every English and British monarchIt\u0026#39s time to dispel the stigma that surrounds addictionSaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists saving worlds banana crop","story":"The 1943 Louis Prima hit “Yes! We Have No Bananas” became the unofficial theme tune for rationing during the Second World War when the Ministry of Food banned the import of the fruit to save ships.But now scientists have found a way to make sure bananas remain on grocery shelves.Cambridge University has discovered how to graft species of banana together to transfer beneficial characteristics, such as disease resistance - a task that was believed impossible before now “I read back over decades of research papers on grafting and everybody said that it couldn’t be done,” said Dr Greg Reeves, a Gates Cambridge Scholar in the University of Cambridge Department of Plant Sciences, and first author of the paper.“I was stubborn enough to keep going - for years - until I proved them wrong.”The breakthrough comes at a crucial time when banana plantations are under threat from soil-borne pathogens including Panama disease which has been destroying drops for over 30 years.A recent acceleration in the spread of this disease has prompted fears of global banana shortages.Single variety vulnerable to diseaseThe world’s banana industry is based on a single variety, called the Cavendish banana - a clone that can withstand long-distance transportation, but has no genetic ersity, making it vulnerable to disease. Cavendish bananas are also sterile so disease resistance cannot be bred into future generations of the plant. Until now it was thought impossible to graft grass-like plants in the group known as monocotyledons because they lack a specific tissue type, called the vascular cambium, in their stem.But scientists have found that when tissue is still embryonic in seeds, it can fuse sufficiently with a different species, allowing for grafting. It means that species can be combined without the need for genetic modification. “We’ve achieved something that everyone said was impossible, said Professor Julian Hibberd in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Plant Sciences, senior author of the report.“We found that even distantly related species, separated by deep evolutionary time, are graft compatible.Grafting embryonic tissue holds real potential across a range of grass-like species.Technique transferrable to other plants There are an estimated 60,000 plants that are monocotyledons, including food staples like rice, wheat and barley. Being able to add helpful traits could bring huge benefits to the food industry. The team has also shown it works in pineapple, onion, tequila agave and date palm by injecting fluorescent dye into the plant roots – from where it was seen to move up the plant and across the graft junction.“It’s an urgent challenge to make important food crops resistant to the diseases that are destroying them,” added Dr Reeves.“Our technique allows us to add disease resistance, or other beneficial properties like salt-tolerance, to grass-like plants without resorting to genetic modification or lengthy breeding programmes.”The researchers have filed a patent for their grafting technique through Cambridge Enterprise. “Panama disease is a huge problem threatening bananas across the world. It’s fantastic that the University of Cambridge has the opportunity to play a role in saving such an important food crop,” said Dr Louise Sutherland, Director Ceres Agri-Tech, a collaboration between Cambridge, four other universities and three agricultural research institutes.The research was published in the journal Nature.More from NewsStranded and disabled children amid horror of Ukraine\u0026#39s warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv braces for onslaught as Russian forces encircle cityUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russian troops \u0026#39kidnap\u0026#39 Melitopol mayorWestminster holds weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meeting for first time in historyBillionaire ‘Tyrant’ unveils collection of coins minted by every English and British monarchIt\u0026#39s time to dispel the stigma that surrounds addictionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"adorable jack russell no eyes","story":"Adorable Jack Russell with no eyes in desperate need of new homeSix-year-old Polly is currently up for adoption with Blind Dog Rescue UK and is hoping to secure a new home with loving owners committed to showing her the world through sound and scentPolly had to have both of her eyes removed Image: Blind Dog Rescue UKByPaige FreshwaterContent Editor:,  Mar |commentsAfter having her eyes surgically removed, little Polly became closed off to the world around her - and now needs an owner to help her out of her shell.The six-year-old dog had to have both of her eyes removed due to glaucoma, a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve.

Brendan Wyatt, who owns Liverpool clothing store Transalpino, had no experience of the aid industry, but after seeing the harrowing scenes of fleeing women and children, and our ­government’s pitul response to it, he couldn’t just sit back and watch. He left last weekend with his mate Robin Grime and Rado Chmiel, a Pole living in Liverpool, as interpreter. When they reached Rzeszow close to the Ukraine border, they went to a Macro store and filled a hired van full of food, blankets, nappies, sanitary towels, kids’ shoes and toys bought with the £, they had raised en route.  They then drove to a refuge centre and handed the much-needed supplies over to  grateful and humbled women and children. When I asked Brendan why he made the trip, he answered “because I could”. He is just one of countless British citizens, moved by the haunting plight of desperate Ukrainians, doing their bit to help, whether giving money, volunteering with charities or heading there to fight. But while we’re witnessing sacrice, generosity and action from below, at the top we’re seeing coldness, indference and mental torture by bureaucracy. Krzysztof Mikucki, a builder who drove from Mansfield to the Romanian border to pick up his Ukrainian we and her mother, and drive them back to safety in Britain, was one of hundreds held up for hours by UK Border Force staff at Calais and eventually told to go to Brussels or Paris to apply for a visa. “They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” he said, angrily.  Refugees who have tried to come here to escape Putin’s genocide speak of our government treating them like criminals. And sadly they are spot-on. Because the Home Office’s lamentable excuse for not acting in the same humane manner as virtually every other European nation and greeting them with open arms is that we have to be sure these people are not spies or terrorists. Even though they are distraught women and children who have been battered out of their homes and are now battered with red tape to keep them out of the UK.How did we reach the point where the greeting from a once-compassionate country to ­families ­travelling , miles to fleethe worst nightmare imaginable is a taped-up piece of A paper on a Calais hostel window sending them back  miles to Paris or ­Brussels How was there no one in authority ­apologising and explaining what was going on, despite this ­effectively being the UK border with Europe   Meanwhile, in the Commons, the liar-in-chief and his immigrant-hating sidekicks shed ­crocodile tears and talk about Britain having an unparalleled tradition for welcoming refugees. Well we did before electing a government primarily on a ticket to shut our borders to outsiders. And whatever schemes they now come up with to distract from their initial response to the victims of Putin’s obscene war, these Tories have shamed Britain into looking small, insular, mean, nasty and cruel. Even though so many of its people are the polar opposite.

Nadhim Zahawi, who fled to Britain as a child from Iraq, said plans were being drawn up to welcome children fleeing the Russian invasion.He said auto-translate software was being rolled out on online learning hub Oak National Academy to help pupils who speak Russian or Ukrainian. Pupils will be able to access quizzes, video lessons with translated subtitles and worksheets. The UK Government has been under intense pressure to do more to help Ukrainians fleeing the brutal conflict after the visa process descended into chaos.  Ukrainians with family ties to Britain can apply for visas but families have reported delays and excessive bureaucracy - with some arriving in Calais only to be sent to visa centres in Brussels or Paris. The Government is expected to set out further details on a separate sponsorship route on Monday, where Brits will be able to host refugees in their own homes. Speaking at the Association of School and College Leadersconference, Mr Zahawi said: We will continue to support Ukrainians in any way we can. I know schools are doing what they can to support their students make sense of what they are seeing. And we are working with schools to ensure that the tens of thousands of Ukrainian children we will welcome to our shores will have a place in our education system. A team in the Department for Education is already making plans for a capacity of , children that we will take into our schools, he said but did not give further details. Mr Zahawi added: The family reunion route will be a couple of hundred thousand people coming through and then the humanitarian route which Michael Gove will outline in the next few days, will be uncapped.He branded the Russian aggression as barbaric, criminal invasion of their sovereign democratic country and said it was almost impossible to imagine the horror of what they are going through.

He spoke out during a visit to Birmingham Children’s Hospital today when he was asked whether he intended to bring forward a fourth booster shot. He said: When it comes to vaccinations and any future vaccinations, we listen carefully to what our expert advisers have to say in the JCVI. They have said recently... that certainly for groups of people, the over-s, immunosuppressed, those in residential care homes, they will receive a second booster shot... a fourth dose, and that will begin in the coming weeks.  We are preparing for that, and that will be recommended for those that have had at least a six-month gap between that dose and their previous one. When pushed further, he added: We keep it under review, but the right thing to do is to listen to the expert advice... Iaposm very confident with our approach. In February last month, Mr Javid said that the most vulnerable and at risk groups would receive a fourth dose in coming weeks. This was to help ensure they maintained a high-enough level of protection against the deadly virus.  Those who are eligible will be offered the jab around six months after their last dose. The latest figures have shown that, for the first time since the end of January, all four home nations have seen week-on-week spikes in infections.Figures published by the ONS infection survey show that, across the UK as a whole, . million people were estimated to have coronavirus last week. That number stood at . million at the start of the year, however this is a rise from . million.Mr Javid said the Government was continuing to monitor the situation very carefully in response to a rise in Covid- infections among the elderly and in childrenaposs hospitals.Obviously we monitor the situation regularly, we keep it under review, but at this stage things are very steady as we learn to live with Covid, he said. It does underline the importance of the defences we have built. Getting vaccinated, particularlyyou havenapost been vaccinated already, is very important. Whilst itaposs great to see, when it comes to the boosters, eight out of  adults have had their booster shots, those two out of  that have not yet come forward - itaposs still a very good time to come forward.

Currently, more than , English secondary schools employ A level teachers without the qualications to teach Music and Drama at that level subjects that are widely considered accessible for the privileged few. Bridget Phillipson, in her debut speech as Shadow Education Secretary, is expected to back parentsapos priorities, and give every child a rounded, fulfilling education on all subjects - including creative ones. She will reject “ choices” between prioritising academic and creative education, arguing that creativity, collaboration and problem solving promoted through sport and drama are as essential to the skills and jobs of the future. Ms Phillipson will say in Birmingham: As children grow up … school becomes more, not less, narrow. And that narrowing turns too many young people off learning which is a problem for their future and all of our futures.  We must retain the breadth. “I make no apology for being determined to see young people achieve academically, and just as important I want to see them thrive in le. It comes after former Schools Minister Nick Gibb revealed  state schools did not employ an A Level music teacher with such qualications and , with the relevant drama qualications. Creative subjects have seen huge declines in teacher numbers, with drama and music seeing declines of around %, according to official data. Ms Phillipson will add: “Knowledge is essential, but so is the ability to apply that rich knowledge to the real world, ensuring young people learn communication, collaboration and problem solving skills, and understand the dference they can make.“That is why Keir Starmer has announced Labour ’s Council of Skills Advisors to support us in ensuring every young person receives a rounded education that instils a love of learning and equips them with the skills they need for work and for le.” Labour has vowed to recruit , new teachers as part of its national excellence programme. Under a decade of Conservative government rule, fewer British kids choose to pursue creative subjects at GCSE like Music and Drama. The number of youngsters taking Drama and Music subjects at GCSE has slumped by more than % from  , to   with , taking the subjects last year. With more teachers, the party believes it can tackle the shortage of teachers which leaves some schools without the expertise to give every child a rounded, fulfilling education.The Shadow Education Secretaryaposs speech comes as data from the Institute for Public Policy Research, shows parents are increasingly prioritising their children’s enjoyment of learning and understanding of the world around them. Londonaposs prestigious Royal Academy of Music has previously revealed less than half of its pupils starting undergraduate degrees came from state schools in . The UKaposs top violinist Nigel Kennedy once vowed to drum out elitism within music education as he feared the subject had only become accessible to the privileged few. For me, the cause of this dumbing down is a natural rebellion against the ill-informed classical music administrators who consciously encourage exclusivity, refusing to embrace those outside their spectacularly precious world, he said.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyJess PhillipsEducationSchoolsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He just doesnt know it yetThe only issue is how the rest of the world makes it clear, says Fleet Street FoxVladimir Putin - loseropinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsCast your mind back to the last time you played Monopoly with a sore loser. He - and itaposs always a he - insists on being banker. He declares your family tradition of stashing all the fines in Free Parking to be against the rules. His pile of cash and houses seems to grow every time someone goes to get another bag of crisps, or pops to the loo.Then one player he has driven to the brink of bankruptcy lands on Free Parking, and scoops the jackpot. The balance of the game swings away from the bully. He is found in breach of the rules himself. The others co-ordinate against him, and dad - itaposs always dad - gts his cash and assets to the person most likely to destroy the aggressor. When he buys hotels no-one visits, is jailed and unable to take rent, when the lie that he was All-England Monopoly Champion  is finally disproved, and he has been reduced to being little more than a tiny, pewter boot, he flips the board in a fury.  Weaposve all played with that guy. And picked up the pieces afterwards. We all know there was never any point in helping him to lose more gently so that he could save face. He needed to lose - and for everyone to know it.The wheels have been ripped off Vladimir Putinaposs unserviced trucks. The tanks have been immobile on the roads, and have now gone off-road to become immobile in the mud. Goliathaposs planes and helicopters have been shot down by Davidaposs surface-to-air missiles, and the children Putin sent to war have died in such numbers heaposs been forced to order up mercenaries and Bashar al Assadaposs surviving conscripts. Heaposs shut down the TV stations, lost his Big Macs, and destroyed the mobile phone masts which his own intelligence forces were using to communicate. His generals are dying on the frontline because they had to abandon the control room to get their orders followed. He restructured Russiaaposs economy to be based on energy extraction and supply, and half the worldaposs stopped buying it overnight. The only people choosing to be on his side are the thicker end of the Cha terraces.Nothing in those previous two paragraphs happens when youaposre winning. Andit happens in the space of two weeks, the board-flipping moment when Putin realises his own failure cannot be far off. But whataposs worrying the West is what heaposll do to distract from the loss. Will he mine or gas Ukraine as he retreats  Will he fire tactical, smaller nukes which will obliterate buildings, irradiate the concrete dust sucked into the fireball, and then allow microscopic, inhalable radioactive particles to fall gently along the routes of prevailing winds  Perhaps he will release any one of the deadly pathogens he holds within the worldaposs largest bioweapon stockpile.Thataposs why world leaders, analysts, and journalists talk about an off-ramp, giving the madman an exit where he can make a dignied withdrawal and save face. They want him to think he can keep his job and his billionsonly he de-escalates, and steps back from the brink.The problem with that is a madman in a tank doesnapost give a s*** about the rules of the road. The point at which he was sane enough to spot and take an exit route was waaaaaaaay back, before he lost his mind. If this guy saw an off-ramp now, heaposd bomb it.If Putin is capable of using unimaginably-bad weapons - and he is - then he is adrt from the reality he would need to have any instinct of self-preservation. The flipping of the board is as certain as the coup daposetat the oligarchs he created will stage to save their looted billions. The issue with both is not , but when. Read more If it happens soon, thousands and maybe millions of lives can be saved. The Russian economy can recover, and the world can help Ukraine pick up the pieces. To act against Putin, his deposer needs to be more realistic and practical than he is, which is why it would work in the worldaposs favour and is perhaps also why it hasnapost happened yet among the men he has manipulated and paid off for two decades.Thataposs the end-game the world and its leaders must seek, because Putin is past the point of saving his own face. He would happily saw it off himself, then threaten to do everybody aposs,you let him have so much as a butter kne.The world needs him to lose. To have no exit, and to know it. All despots must see what happensyou invade a sovereign nation, and that the Westaposs immense financial power, whether in the shape of official sanctions or a spontaneous customer boycott, is a weapon with no possible defence.Because he was always going to flip the board one day,you let him play. Giving him an off-ramp means heaposs still mad, and heaposs still got a tank. Letting him slice off a piece of Ukraine is like letting him go bankrupt, but keep a hotel on Mayfair. We should never have sat down with someone who has never obeyed, but only imposed, rules. We are counting the cost of making money while he picked on someone . But the only upside of playing a game with a sore loser is that, when he loses, he feels sorest. Economically throttling his cronies is the swtest, best and only weapon we can use, because they want to keep playing this game. Our best hope is that Putin realises heaposs lost when the board, and all the lives on it, are no longer within his reach.

Sharon Sutila, , is a mum-of-two with a sixth sense for when people are telling porkies - something she claims to have learned from raising -year-old Marissa and -year-old Tesla. Now the CEO of Cluso Investigation, which she founded in , Sharon puts her super sleuth skills to work uncovering secrets people would rather keep buried. Sharon, who describes herself as a human lie detector, says her kids donapost even bother lying to her anymore, as they know theyaposll get caught. The mum from the US state of Delaware said: My skillset means I stay as neutral as I can, evenI don’t trust what they are telling me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I don’t call them out, I try to stay cool and find outthey are telling me the truth, but I always find out. They are aware of that, so they have grown up knowing it is always better to tell the truth. If theyaposve ever told me they don’t have homework when they do, they know I will find out about it.She described an incident when Marissa was little and she tried to conceal a mark sheaposd made in the house from her mum. Sharon says she not only found out about the mark, but also went as far as showing her daughter the New York state laws to let her know lying has consequences. She said: I think it scared her to death!  The mum reckons she honed her detective skills when she was just  years old and channelled her favourite literary characters, Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew. After a classroom bully smashed her favourite record and wrote her a nasty note, Sharon was determined to expose them to her teacher. She found out who the culprit was by comparing their handwriting to the homework of her peers. After graduating from university in , Sharon shunned the family business in fishing and seafood to embark upon a career in tech for IBM. There, she realised she could use her coding skills to suss out new potential employees - and she pointed out those who werenapost telling the truth on their CVs.  People had put degrees that they had never taken and qualications that they never had, she said. And when her bosses discovered her skills, she became an integral part of the companyaposs international operation. Sharon said: I wanted to know more about the person, or I couldn’t be sure they weren’t lying to me. I absolutely love research, figuring things out and problem solving. I like challenges. Now working as a private investigator, Sharon says sheaposs skilled at finding out things about people from the comfort of her own home - as long as she has a computer. She said: I mostly work on allowing people to tell me what they want to tell me first. And I’ll try to seethey are being honest.  While Sharon enjoys her work, sheaposs had to put up with her fair share of threats from people who sheaposs exposed. She said: I have been threatened. A man told me he was going to come into my house. But I’m not going to let someone stop me from doing my job just because they are being aggressive. I’m not going to stop what I do because of a threat. Sharon has now penned a novel based on some of her experiences working in a male-dominated industry, called The Healing. She said: Championing equality for women is my lelong passion. Challenging gender bias and the stereotyping of women is critically important to combat the issue. I wrote my book by starting my character with a lot of my own background. I grew up in the same time frame as the book and went through the very same gender norms, which can mean women canapost do or achieve certain things. In the book, the character starts in the same way I did - being told I couldnapost follow my own path. And she is trying to find her purpose in the world.

Evie Plumb, now , realised she hadnapost been taught much about STIs after she contracted both the HPV virus and chlamydia. The entrepreneur from Bishopaposs Stortford, Herts, recalled first realising she had contracted an infection when she had genital warts. She said: “I convinced myself I was dying and I was filled with shame. After Googling her condition, Evie said she felt even worse - and realised thereaposs not much information available about STIs online. Once sheaposd been treated for both conditions, Evie decided it was high time women were more educated about sex - including how to reach orgasm. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereCreating a community called the Clitorati on Instagram, Evie began posting funny but informative explainers on everything from sex toys to the G-spot.During the first lockdown in  she launched a podcast interviewing sex experts around the world - and even released her own brand of lubricant. Now, she has , followers on her Cliterally The Best Instagram page, who are keen to learn more about womenaposs sexual pleasure. She said: I think the biggest thing is all about unlearning and learning instead to own your pleasure and self-pleasure, because there is so much shame around this.  As well as talking about the fun aspects of sex, she also uses her  to educate women on the HPV virus - which is the name for  dferent strains of virus that affect the mouth, throat or genital area.According to the NHS, most of us will contract at least one of these strains in our letime.Evie, who is in a long-term relationship with boyfriend Josh, , said: “When you are little, sex education is so shame-based and you are told everything is bad, like getting pregnant. You learn nothing about enjoyment – it’s all, aposDon’t do this and don’t do that.apos “It takes a while to unlearn it all.”  She looks back on her childhood in explaining why she was so interested in liberating women in their sexual desires. Evie recalls being slut shamed in a society that made girls feel wrong for showing an interest in sex and pleasure. She added her lack of knowledge around the female orgasm meant her early sexual experiences were fumbling and anti-climactic - literally.Evie said: The first time you have sex, you are told you’ll have these orgasms and then there’s no focus on female pleasure. You are waiting for a moment of epiphany that is unlikely to happen.I used to focus on what men thought about me and what they wanted. Now, Iaposm not selfish, but I do stuff for me, not for other people.You have to learn to ask for what you want and advocate for your own pleasure. After her Cliterally The Best Instagram page took off, Evie launched a website where women can learn about gynaecological health and pick up sex tips.Since launching the pages, Evie says sheaposs been inundated with messages of thanks from women who are having better sex. I had one woman in her s come up to me and thank me so much for recommending this sex toy, because she had her first orgasm, she said. It makes it feel worthwhile. As Evie has grown in popularity, sheaposs been dubbed the sexual pleasure fairy godmother. She is now qualied to teach sex education - but insists she is constantly researching and learning more about sex, gender and intimacy.Although she was initially apprehensive about talking to her family about her new enterprise, Evie is now proud of her work.She said: “When I originally launched the podcast with my friend, I didn’t tell my parents what it was about, but as it grew, I explained and they were a little hesitant but just wanted to know I was safe.“But as it got bigger and I started to have press mentions, they were happy to learn about it and have been very supportive ever since.” However, despite receiving plenty of support for her work, Evie still has to put up with slut-shaming by trolls - and says she receives unsolicited X-rated images from men at least twice a week.She said: “I’m numb to them now, but they used to make me very, very angry.Sadly, there is no reasoning with these people. It’s a power thing and you have no consent in whether or not you see it.”She claims she was even contacted by a man who blamed Evie when his we wanted a orce - because he wasnapost sexually fulfilling her. Evie said: “He tried to blame me because she mentioned my page. She told him to, aposGo to this and learn what I meanapos.” As Evieaposs movement grows, she hopes to also move into the role of sex ambassador for schools and to design a sex education course for kids.She said: My dream is to do a course to become a psychosexual therapist and turn Cliterally The Best into a hub people come to for information and therapy.I want therapy to be more accessible and to make the website a home for sex and learning.I would like to see the conversation around sex education become a normal thing, to be spoken about as openly and without shame.

But Bailey has been left all alone, after -year-old Naja was put down last week following a rapid deterioration in her health. It comes less than  months after the pair lost Malika in October , at the age of . Now, staff at Colchester Zoo are keeping a close eye on lonely Bailey and are even considering relocating him to another zoo with a pride of lionesses.  In a statement issued on their website earlier this week, zoo staff wrote: We would like to thank all our visitors for the overwhelming support that we have received following the devastating news of the passing of our female lioness, Naja, on Friday, March . We have received many kind messages towards our staff, as well as concerns about our male lion, Bailey. Bailey’s health and welfare is our top priority and, whilst our Animal Care Team continues to monitor him daily, discussions have been put in place by the Animal Care Management Team regarding Bailey’s future at Colchester Zoo. The team are currently exploring bringing in a female lioness for Bailey, but this option is reliant on a lioness being available at one of our neighbouring zoos. However, given Bailey’s age, introducing a female at this stage in his le could prove too stressful. The team are also exploring relocating Bailey to another zoo with a pride of lionesses. This would be dependent on another organisation having the space to house Bailey and the move alone could prove too much. Bailey has become a big part of the Colchester Zoo family and parting with him feels almost impossible and irresponsible. Read more Our Animal Care Team will continue to monitor Bailey’s mental and physical welfare over the next few weeks. It’s our responsibility to ensure that Bailey’s welfare is at the forefront of any decision made, which may include letting him live out the rest of his le here at the zoo by himself. A previous statement last week paid tribute to Naja, writing: Naja was truly one of a kind. Her personality and character set her aside from any other animal we’ve had the pleasure to work with. Naja had a gentle side where she would interact with her keepers, but very quickly changed when food was available! Not only will all the staff at Colchester Zoo miss Naja, but she also leaves behind our male lion, Bailey. Bailey and Naja were cousins along with Naja’s sister, Malika, who passed away back in . All three lions had a strong bond, with the bond between Bailey and Naja made even stronger with the loss of Malika.

But they have put out an urgent plea for help to find a new home, close to Lancashire, for their family - as their isolated location has become uninhabitable. DAS Dalmatians is currently based just outside Newton Abbott, Devon - or the middle of nowhere, as they describe it.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.The property gets flooded every time it rains, and the roads are so bad that emergency services cannot reach it, reports the LiverpoolEcho.Sue said: We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything.aposaposA few weeks ago we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposaposThe couple were forced to stop taking in new dogs last month due to the state of their premises. But they want to keep to continue on their mission to help dalmatians, so they are now appealing for dog-friendly potential landlords to get in touch. The couple currently live in a triple stable, with a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a lounge - which is usually filled with dalmatians. And le with a pack of dogs is tough - as it means getting up before sunrise to let the dogs out into their field. Sue said: Biscuit likes to sing to us at .am every morning until one of us gets up and lets him onto our bed. Thankfully heaposs the only one that does that. The dogs donapost live in kennels or cages - instead lounging about on the beds and sofas around their converted stable home.  Dinnertime consists of shovelling out kg of dog biscuits every day, with Sue on hand to make sure every dog gets enough. Sue, a full-time dog mum, said: Le with these dogs is madness - but I wouldnapost have it any other way. You have to be dotty to have so many spotties. Iaposve always loved dogs but I love dalmatians because they are dferent. The first dog the couple helped was a six-month-old puppy who was being sold as part of a drug deal. Sue said: The poor little mite was very skinny, dirty and stunk of smoke. We have been asked to help more and more dogs over the years and have never wanted to stop. The couple rehome the dalmatians that are able to live a normal le after being assessed and rehabilitated but take in the kids that cannot be rehomed. She said: These pups stay with us forever being loved and having the best we can give them. We also help dogs that other rescues say no to. If a dog needs our help, I will do whatever I can do to helpwe have room but sadly at the moment, we can not help dogs that are threatened to be euthanised as we do not have room to keep them separated while being assessed.  The eldest of their dogs are Zakky and Zena, aged  who has been with Sue for two years. The pair are brother and sister whose owner died and left them on their own. Sue said: Zakky has a long bite history and bit Dave on meeting him - which can happen quite often with new problem kids. Zakky took a while to realise he didn’t have to bite anymore and now is one of the family and very loving. Zena now has dementia but still knows how to con her Dad into sharing his food with her. We stopped them from being separated - another rescue was going to split them up but they were  years old, it would have been awful for them to do that so they came here. They need to find a new home soon so they can take more dogs - and ideally, one that is in a more suitable location, more easily accessible for food deliveries and vet visits. Sue said: There are no kennels and as the dogs are free-range, they are very happy and don’t bark. Keeping them in a home environment is much better for their well-being. We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything. We are on the side of a valley, so every time it rains it floods us. The roof has holes in it so we are exposed to the elements. In summer it is so dusty - I get such bad chest infections. The road is so narrow and bumpy that emergency services are also unable to reach us. aposaposOn Sunday we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposapos Sue continued: People donapost realise that the dogs are so quiet because they donapost live in kennels - they donapost make a noise. We have so many wonderful dogs that need our care, a huge mixture of ages - and we donapost want them to live in mud anymore.aposapos Sue and Dave, who run the sanctuary full-time, are ideally after a long term let, within a few hours drive of Morecambe Bay in a rural setting with at least an acre of land and a yard.You can donate to the sanctuary here.

Dubbed ‘Deltacron’, the new French-based strain combines both lineages. However, its severity is not yet known.But there is a warning that immunity is waning in the elderly as one scientist added that it is aposthe real thingapos. The World Health Organisation said it is apostracking and discussingapos the iant following research into the strain. There is no clear data yet to show whether Deltacron is more infectious than its predecessors. Health chiefs told The Sun a very small number of cases have been detected in Britain, but more details are to be reported in a briefing on Friday.Aris Katzourakis, professor of evolution and genomics at the University of Oxford, said: “It is one to keep an eye on. This one is legit. Dr Stephen Grfin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Whilst it doesn’t seem to have taken off as a dominant strain yet, this could be due to a very slow start based upon seeding density - the number of initial cases, he said.“There are multiple scenarios that can play out here in terms of what this means for people that become infected as this combination of viral proteins may behave dferently to either parent. “The French cluster appears to be a validated occurrence where a recombination event has given rise to a virus fit enough to circulate.Last month, the UK Health Security Agency announced it was investigating a iant named “Delta x Omicron Recombinant ”.However, it is not knownthis is linked to the French-based Deltacron.  Hospitalisation in the UK have shown an aposuptickapos in the past fortnight, data shows. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study estimates around , people are catching Covid each day - a  per cent hike in one week. Study co-founder Professor Tim Spector said: “The ‘official’ UK dashboard rate that continues to provide a misleading picture of the pandemic in the UK and should be scrapped. “The major increase in new cases across the country and in the elderly is a worry, especially as we now see an uptick in hospitalisations for the first time. “This increase was predicted when all restrictions were lted. “We are likely to continue to see high infection and prevalence rates of  in  people for the foreseeable future.” Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UKHSA, said: “The increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of OxfordCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chased by owner Tess Swan, Kratu bounded gleefully around the course, missing jumps, ignoring obstacles and even running over to say hello to a group of volunteers mid-way through.Then he ran into a plastic tunnel and failed to come out the other side, finally emerging from the end he had gone in. Commentator Peter Purvis declared: “I love it. That’s the real trick, to turn around in there. How did he do that ” The joyful display won Kratu, a fluffy Carpathian-Mioritic mix, fans around the world and invites back to Crufts for the next two years.  His  agility performance, his last before retiring, was just as show-stopping, the mischievous Kratu even making off with a pole from one of the hurdles. But while Kratu and Tess’s Crufts appearances never fail to amuse, the story of how they found each other – and rescued each other – is truly heartwarming. Tess, , whose book, Incredible Kratu, was published this week, credits him with helping her recover after she fell into a spiral of addiction and abuse. She says: “He saved my le. I was very tired of le. Some of my memories are horric. I saved Kratu’s le, and he’s saved mine many times. “He’s the reason I get up every morning.”Undiagnosed autistic Tess’s le began to fall apart at the age of  after her father died and she found herself living in a filthy squat in a block of flats in Lambeth, south London. After her boyfriend died of a drugs overdose, Tess turned to heroin as “a respite from the pain”. She says: “I’d tried to take my own le a couple of times. Living was so painful. I was lost in a world I could not understand or navigate. I encountered much abuse and violence, I learnt to survive.” Tess, who had a daughter in this time, got deeply involved in London’s criminal world. But contracting hepatitis C was a “wake-up call” and she moved to Cambridgeshire, where she got clean, but still struggled with PTSD. Then a dog rescuer friend, Celia, found a “frightened pup” in a Roma camp in Romania. Tess says: “She told me she knew he was the one for me. I soon fell in love with him, I knew he was going to be my best friend.” But he was a handful – “like having the Honey Monster on a lead” – so she got help from dog trainer Wendy Kruger at Wood Green Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambs. Kratu came on so well she entered him into some agility courses at dog shows. Tess recalls his first, saying: “We were just coming up to the last jump and he turned around and did the entire course backwards, with me chasing him in astonishment. “It was hilarious.”  Tess and Kratu entered Crufts in , when he completed the course without many mishaps. It was on theirthe next year that he stole the show. Tess says: “When he went into that tunnel and didn’t come out the other end, I was like a rabbit in the headlights. It was like, ‘Where the b****y hell has my dog gone ’ “Afterwards I gave him a big hug. I realised what he did was far better, he was a free spirit. That ticked all my boxes. I just embraced him for the rebel and the rascal that he is.  “He makes me laugh so much and that’s one of the biggest gts for me, to laugh, after a letime of crying and pain and sadness and despair. “We look at each other, I laugh and he woofs. We have the deepest animal human bond.” Incredible Kratu by Tess Eagle Swan and Lynne Barrett-Lee is available now .

Kate had her sister Pippa as her maid of honour while Prince William chose his younger brother Prince Harry as his best man.Harry kept up best man tradition by giving a speech at the wedding reception - and according to many of the guests it was the highlight of the big day, evenhe did make Kate cry. Royal author Katie Nicholl gave an insight into the tear-jerking speech in her biography Harry: Le, Loss, and Love.  She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests.

When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Kate and brother-in-law Harry previously had a jovial relationship - he even famously described Kate as the sister he never had and the pair were often seen giggling or sharing a joke at royal events.But according to royal expert Duncan Larcombe, Harry and Kateaposs sibling-like relationship is now long in the past.  It comes amid a growing feud between William and Harry and the fact that Harry and we Meghan Markle decided to quit as royals and leave the UK for Calornia. And speaking earlier this year as Kate approached her th birthday, Duncan told OK! : Kate was, as Harry said, the sister he never had and clearly that is not the case anymore.There was a time when Harry would have been instrumental in any celebrations or any fun that the couple were having, but those days are long in the past.

Stephanie Hanson welcomed her first daughter, Daphne, into the world on January , . It was just three months later that she discovered she was pregnant again, and was shockingly already three weeks along.Ten months after Daphne’s birthday, she gave birth to twin daughters Rubie and Penelope - on December  of the same year, reports.Women typically only begin ovulating again around  days, or six weeks, after giving birth.So Stephanie was in total disbelief upon discovering the pregnancy test she took around this time was positive, and she was already three weeks along. “I was in a newborn fog, and [then] there was the excitement of this new relationship,” she said. “I was just adjusting to everything. She said her first thought was for little Daphne she was concerned that her first-born wouldn’t have one-on-one time with her anymore. However, Stephanie said Daphne was “delighted” upon meeting her newborn twin sisters, and wanted to give them hugs right away. The sisters are now very close, Stephanie said, sharing a room and doing everything together.

She quickly settled on being a delivery driver, which she could fit around her current hours at the airport and soon realised how lucrative her second job could be.The mum-of-one, from Worthing, West Sussex, did so well that she eventually decided to quit her day job after two years. She can now rake in up to a grand a week by putting in -hour days and is able to plan her schedule around her two-year-old daughter.  And the profit she has made from the delivery job is enough to fund a nice lestyle, including a recent trip to Disney World in Florida. Atlanta said: Iaposm really happy I made the decision to do this job full time. With delivering, I can choose my own hours, work as much as I wish too and earn the same money or more. It was a risk as delivering is self employed and the money is not guaranteed, but I have no regrets and it is working really well.  Atlanta worked at Gatwick prior to giving birth and realised that she could make extra money by delivering while on maternity leave. She said: I worked there for three and a half years but I have a daughter who is coming up to three years old. The hours I had to work and the sht pattern was not flexible enough at the airport. I started delivering whilst on my maternity leave as an extra form of income. Thanks to the flexibility of delivering, I found I could work the hours I wanted to around my daughter. I started posting videos of me delivering on my social media which did really well so I decided to leave my full time job so I could pursue delivering and growing my social media channels.  Since ditching the airport job, Atlanta has been putting in the hours working on her own time delivering in the car for Just Eat, Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Beelivery. She starts as early as am and works until as late as :pm - racking up around  deliveries on a busy day. Her hard work has been worth it as sheaposs been raking in the cash, making up to £, a week through delivering across the south east of England. Between February  and February  alone, she earned £. from Just Eat, £. from UberEats, £. from Deliveroo and £. from Beelivery, as well as £ in cash tips - totalling at an impressive £. in just one week.  Atlanta was amazed by the amount of money sheaposs been making alongside her boyfriend, Benjamin Hasker, , who also works as a delivery driver as well as a magician and doing Punch and Judy shows. The mum has no plans toto the airline industry and is thrilled with her new career. She said: Itaposs not guaranteed to be £, every week - the more hours you put in, the more you earn. Thanks to my hard work earning this amount of money, myself, my daughter and my partner all went to Disney World, Florida, for two weeks in December  . This was my daughteraposs first ever holiday. I have already bought two cars outright in the time that I have been delivering for work. I havenapost bought anything for my daughteraposs third birthday yet as it is in June, but we are planning to go to London for the weekend for a trip to London Zoo. Iaposm really happy I chose to pursue this as a full time career. It was a risk but I have no regrets.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided their future is not in the UK, while Prince Andrew is not expected to everto public le.But the enforced alterations donapost begin to scratch the surface of whataposs ahead, some believe.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Charles has long been prepping for the new era and he has Palace hangers-on firmly in his eye-line. It has long been said that the -year-old plans a major shake-up of the when he becomes head of state - and it could also affect royal residences. It remains to be seen which members of the family will be trimmed but analyst Jonathan Sacerdoti told the Mirrror things are about to become very modern.He said: I think when Charles takes to the throne we will see the emphasis put on those who command absolute respect.  The demands of responsibility and certain behaviours that are needed will be at the forefront - simply, you must be totally reliable. It is well known that Charles wants to stamp his mark and in modern times, donapost be surprised to see changes made. It will be a very handy way to respond to the recent controversies, such as Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Harryaposs attacks on the family. The core will be there, and Prince George will join in time - I think that is clear.  But it’s always been speculated that Charles, when he eventually takes over, will want to slim down the working royals at the heart of the family. It will be about commanding respect. I think he is looking forward to being King. It is not simply a change of personnel thataposs ahead of us. Senior royals are acutely aware of the requirement to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales.  Opening of Buckingham Palace to the public is one idea that the future king is said to be keen to explore. Thereaposs a sense that he wants a slimmed down monarchy to make sure that everybody is doing their bit and [there are] no so-called hangers-on, royal expert Camilla Tominey said. “It does make the future of the monarchy kind of uncertain. “We’ve had this model that the Queen has been at the head of for all of this time, because she’s obviously been on the throne for nearly seven decades.”“That means by association that you’re going to have fewer royals taking on fewer patronages, and then what does that mean for the charities ” she told The ’s Royal Insight podcast.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Buckingham PalacePrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He added: I donapostapos think that aposwarts and allapos moment is going to happen. The book is tipped to to go on sale later this year and may royal watchers were concerned about what its contents. It was first suggested it could reveal the Princeaposs true feelings towards his step-mother Camilla while others suggested it would aposshake the monarchy to its core.  A £ million memoir deal was signed by Harry with J R Moehringer which his publishers have described as the definitive account of the experience, adventures, losses, and le lessons that have helped shape him. Harry did not warn the Royal Yamily of his decision to write a book, it has believed, which reportedly left many in the Firm aposblindsidedapos by the announcement. Prince Harry and his grandmother have always shared a particularly close bond and royals aficionados believe any revelations he does make will not include her. During Harry and Meghanaposs controversial Oprah interview he spoke of his respect for his grandmother and said that he had spoken to her a great deal recently.

Will you be sad to see Harry miss the memorial  Have your say in the comment section He said he would feel unsafe bringing his two children Archie, two, and Lilibet, nine months, over to the UK. Experts previously claimed Harry would have been given aposadequateapos protection for the March  event in Westminster Abbey, and during his stay in Windsor. Harry had said long ago he felt it was not safe to bring his we or children back to the country. Angela Levin, Harry’s biographer, told the Sun: “He has snubbed the Duke of Edinburgh but really he is snubbing the Queen.”  She said the Queen was still grieving the loss of Philip, her husband of  years, and suggested Harry may well use the same reasoning to avoid attending his grandmotheraposs Platinum Jubilee celebration as well. She went on: “He has got this all wrong. If he comes over for a royal event he gets police protection. What they won’t do is,he goes out with his friends he gets security.” Harry has been back to the UK only twice since leaving for the US in  with we Meghan. He ed for Philip’s funeral last April only days after he told Oprah Winfrey of racist comments made by royal family members about his children, without revealing who he was referring to. Two months later he attended an unveiling of a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace.This comes as Buckingham Palace revealed today that the Queen would not be attending the Commonwealth Service on Monday.Instead, Prince Charles will be attending in her place.

Miss Wadsworth appeared before the General Teaching Council for Scotlandyesterday to face the claims, Glasgow Live reports. Support teacher Pamela Dougall gave evidence to the , and said she was left in tears after witnessing on the incidents. She said: I witnessed Miss Wadsworth dragging Pupil A back along the floor back to the classroom. Her [Pupil A] tummy was on the floor, she looked terried. I put my hands on my head and said aposyou canapost do thatapos. I asked Pupil Ashe was alright, she put her thumbs up as she is a non-verbal child. Pupil A has a mental age of roughly  to  months. I was in a state of shock, every time I saw Pupil A that day I cried.  She said: The working relationship with Miss Wadsworth was dficult. I got the feeling that she did not want anyone in the class. When I was working with Miss Wadsworth I felt I couldnapost do my job properly as she didnapost trust me. Another support teacher, Jacqueline Steele who was working in a class nearby, told the hearing : I was sitting at a table helping kids finish their work they hadnapost finished and I was looking directly out of the classroom door. I saw Pupil A running past the door.Pupil A stopped at the double doors [ fire exit].Mrs Wadsworth ran up and grabbed Pupil Aaposs arm in quite a forceful manner. Her tugging knocked Pupil A off her balance and she was walking too fast for her to keep up. I put my hands on my head. It was the first time I saw her look frightened. [When Mrs Steele entered Pupil Aaposs classroom] Pupil A was on the floor at the door, it was quite manic and Miss Wadsworth did not have any control of the class. For me it was a child protection issue. That afternoon Pupil A was not herself and was not smiling. You could seeshe looked sad, I was able to tell when she wasnapost happy. Further allegations have been lodged against the teacher such as grabbing the same pupil by the arm and pushing her back onto a chair.

Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely and damage to trees possible. Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and or large waves.” Then more widespread yellow warnings are also in place for Sunday with similar advice to expect travel disruption. BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker warned people that as well as the strong wind people will need their umbrellas.“A lot of cloud and some rain across Scotland, parts of northern England, brighter across the rest of England and Wales, and in fact some decent sunny spells through the middle of the afternoon and I think the best of the weather will be the further east you go, he said, looking at Saturday.  But notice this curl of rain here, this is a low pressure that is swinging into the south west of the UK. Not only rain but some very strong winds, we are talking of gusts of mph, mph and maybe even mph so it is really going to be quite stormy around some of the coasts.” Mr Schafernaker said it is not widespread but advised people in the South West to take care. Then on Sunday the strong winds will cover the country with the weather impacted by a low pressure system by the west of Scotland. Very gusty winds right across the country, we are talking mph, mph or maybe mph around some exposed coasts … on Sunday it will be blustery right across the UK. Temperatures on Sunday typically between C and C so not as mild as it has been but mild enough, said Mr Schafernaker.  Looking ahead to next week and people can expect spring-like temperatures especially in the south. Monday a much better day, the winds will be lighter there will be some sunshine around, still some showers around northern parts of the country but in the south it really is an improving picture and that’s how it is going to be over the next few days into next week, said Mr Schafernaker. In fact in the south of the country temperatures could peak around C or C. So a mixed weekend but better the week ahead.” UK forecast for the next  days Turning wet and windy in the Southwest this afternoon. Today: Sunny spells and showers this morning, with parts of Scotland seeing some more persistent rain. Showers fading for many this afternoon when wet and windy weather with heavy rain coastal gales develops over southwest England and southwest Wales. Tonight: Early evening rain in the southwest moves slowly northeastwards to extend from western Scotland into northwest England, the Midlands and southern England by dawn. Windy, with gales in the west. Sunday: Early rain over parts of Scotland and England clears eastwards, clearing the far east late afternoon. Otherwise, sunny spells and showers. Windy with coastal gales in the north and west. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Occasionally unsettled across northern and western areas, with spells of rain and strong winds. Generally drier where, with some mist and fog overnight, before some rain develops Wednesday.

The odd, reclusive President has an intense daily schedule - and tries to keep intrusions into his personal le strictly limited.Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva in  and the couple had two daughters, Mariya and Yekaterina. Although he is notoriously secretive about his personal le, the couple announced their separation in a staged television interview in June . The orce was later confirmed by Lyudmilaaposs name being removed from Putinaposs official biography on the Kremlin website, so his biography simply mentions their children instead. In his  biography aposFirst Personapos, which contains a series of interviews with the Russian president and figures close to him, Lyudmila shared details of their relationship. In a frank chat, she revealed that she didnapost think much of the poorly dressed man she met outside a theatre while on a double date.Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog But the pair continued to keep in touch after Putin gave her his phone number - a rare move for the privacy-obsessed KGB officer. After three-and-a-half years, Putin proposed, but his subdued manner left Lyudmila convinced he was actually trying to dump her. She took the interviewee: One night we were sitting this house and he said, You know what kind of person I am by now. In general, Iaposm not very easygoing. He was being self-critical. He explained that he was the silent type that he was rather abrupt in some things and he could even insult people, and so on. He was saying that he was a risky le partner. And he added: In three and a half years, you have probably made up your mind. It sounded to me like we were breaking up. aposYes, Iaposve made up my mind,apos I said. He let out a doubtful aposYes apos Then I was sure that that was it, we were breaking up. But then he said, aposWell thenthat is the way it is, I love you and propose we get married.apos So it all came as a complete surprise to me.

The letter, which was published today, says the pandemic is not over and that the approach to vaccine equity is immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure.It says: The European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland continue to block the lting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of Covid- vaccines, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south. The transfer of largely publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how from pharmaceutical corporations would fast track production to a matter of months. Yet still today, a handful of these corporations retain the power to dictate vaccine supply, distribution and price – and the power to decide who lives and who dies. World leaders, and particularly rich nations, have the responsibility to change this situation and ensure the publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how is available to the global south. The letter, which comes on the second anniversary of Covid- being declared a pandemic, is also signed by actress Charlize Theron, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Using side-by-side pics, Hayley - who goes by the username @ hayleymadiganfitness - showed the dference between an Insta Pool Pose Vs What I see in the bathroom mirror, showing a posed pic next to what her bum looks like in reality.In a powerful caption, Hayley explained: Dferent poses, dferent camera angles, dferent posture, dferent lighting can all make a huge dference to how a body is perceived and more specically how you see your own body! You will see your body in all types of angles and poses. You will see your body relaxed and unposed. You will see yourself in many ways so do not let your eyes deceive you by telling you to feel negative towards your own body.  She continued: You have the power to change your mindset, to look at your own body in a kinder manner. To be kinder to yourself and to your mental health. To be kinder to your body, because it is your home and you only have one so treat it with the best kindness you can offer! We often pick holes in our bodies continuously but when you realise that no one worth having in your le wouldn’t ever pick those same holes about you is an important thing to remember. The people that care and love you do not see you the same way, all they see is the happiness, the love, and the sparkle that you bring to them and the world. You’re not just a body, you are YOU, so be kinder to yourself. Many people have been greatly touched by Hayleyaposs wise words, which are so very important in an age where le filtered through a social media lens can seriously impact the way we view our bodies.One person thanked Hayley for bringing some honesty to Instagram, really admire you for this, while another described her honesty as inspiring.A third person remarked that they wished such pics were shown in high schools, adding: I speak for myself around that age, I only saw the ‘perfect’ Instagram bodies. It’s easy to lose track of what is picture-perfect and what is real. I’d rather see everyday-perfect than picture-perfect more.

Itaposs doubtful that additions such as tuna, olives, or turmeric will so much as cross your mind, with many of us preferring milder tastes before weaposve finished that all-important first cup of coffee.However, Deliveroo has rolled out a limited-edition trio of inventively savoury breakfast cereals, each one celebrating a popular takeaway dish.While stocks last, customers in London, Bristol, and Manchester can order a £ box of ‘DeliverOO’s’, selecting from a choice of Sushi Roll, Margherita Pizza, and Chicken Katsu Curry. Weaposve given the bizarre range a go for ourselves - and this is what we thought. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Margherita Pizza CerealI for one have had many a cold leftover pizza slice for breakfast in my time, so didn’t think this one would present too much of a challenge. However, I did hesitate a bit before pouring the milk into the bowl of tiny puff buckwheat kernels.The tomatoey taste comes through quite strongly here - more so than the cheese - but certainly isn’t unpleasant, and thereaposs also a subtle suggestion of basil oil which gives it a surreal rustic Italian feel. Of course, itaposs quite weird to get the familiar taste of doughy, rippable pizza crust encased inside such light - and quickly quite mushy - grain, but this certainly makes for a fun novelty. Out of the three, this undoubtedly tasted the most like the takeaway it was meant to represent, but Iaposm not sure I could stomach it every day, and I didnapost end up finishing the bowl.  Chicken Katsu CurryCereal Katsu curry is one of my all-time favourite takeaway dishes and I was seriously worried that trying a twisted version of it might spoil it for me a bit. I needn’t have feared. I sampled a few of the crunchy maize flakes dry before tucking in properly, and can honestly say that Iaposd happily chow down this product like a bag of crisps. I enjoy anything spicy, and this has a little kick to it that - although not everyoneaposs cup of tea at  am - tickled my taste buds nicely. The curry powder comes through quite strongly here, but the milk pleasantly balances it out, bringing a nice cooling effect. This was my favourite out of the trio by quite a long way, and I found myself munching down spoonful after spoonful.  Sushi RollCereal Now, admittedly this is the one I feared the most. Don’t get me wrong, I love sushi, but the very thought of mixing fish and rice up in a bowl of milk first thing in the morning - even in cereal form - just didn’t sit right with me.I poured a few of the puffed brown rice kernels into the bowl and had a tentative nibble. The overall sushi flavouring came through much more vigorouslythan I thought it would, while a distinct note of wasabi took me by surprise.There was also a strong gingery aftertaste. The brown rice texture went well with this, but it wasn’t screaming cereal to me. After stalling for a minute, I poured a glug of milk into the bowl and held my breath. It was by no means awful, although perhaps not something I could regularly rush down before a morning commute. The milk didn’t compliment the cereal quite as well as it did with the Katsu onebut it was undoubtedly an interesting addition to my breakfast and I was left impressed by the realistically fresh flavour. Okay, so I donapost think Iaposll be switching from my Crunchy Nut Cornflakes anytime soon, but this trio of cereals certainly made for one of the most adventurous breakfasts Iaposve had in a while.A Deliveroo spokespersonsaid: When we heard it was World Cereal Day, we wanted to ‘bowl’ over cereal lovers with a breakfast dish to remember. We know our customers love to try weird and wonderful fusion dishes - which is why we’ve really milked it with this range of cereals.If you live in Manchester, Bristol or London, search ’DeliverOO’s’ in the app and for a bargain £ a pack, you can take a break from cereal monogamy and try something deliciously dferent for breakfast this week.If you fancy giving these unusual cereals a go, you can search ‘DeliverOO’s: Food Flavoured Cereal Shop’ on the Deliveroo app, or online to place an order.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Lee, of Colne, Lancashire, was so left impressed with Lloydaposs positive attitude and fantastic overall work that he offered him a regular job at his company.Going forward, Lloyd will be cleaning his uncleaposs vehicles every month in exchange for some hard-earned cash. His work ethic has clearly already paid off, as he was able to treat his crush to an upgraded date at a local milkshake parlour.Lee, , has since praised his nephewaposs work ethic online, in a post that has clocked up more than , likes and comments. The proud uncle explained: Lloyd just messaged me out of the blue and said that he wanted to take this young lady to McDonaldaposs and askedI had any work for him. I was really buzzing because Iaposve always had a job since I was , paper rounds and whatnot. Heaposs always expressed an interest in being a Saturday boy, earning a bit of money, and having a job to pay for his boxing classes and stuff like that. He never even had an inkling towards receiving any money for free. I said aposno problem, Iaposll find you something. Iaposm sure you can wash the vans and get them ready to goapos.Weaposre going to invite him back every month to do the vans inside and out, so heaposs gained himself a job from it, by just having that little bit of initiative and asking. Itaposs sort of the message that you want to send across really, it was just a chance message and I work in sales and operations so I see that day-to-day - Iaposll e-mail a client aposhow are you doing  We havenapost seen each other for a whileapos and sometimes it can turn into a job. I just wanted to show that to him, itaposs about getting off of your backside and he seems to be wanting to work and he showed that, I was really over the moon for him. Iaposve got two boys and a girl and I hope that they have that same ethic and drive that heaposs got, which is really good for a young lad. Speaking about his work, Lloyd said: It felt really good to finally be able to take the young lady out and it was just so much better with it being money that I earned myself through hard work. Meanwhile, a LinkedIn post written by Lee about his hardworking nephew has seen the youngster heaped with praise and hailed as an aposold-fashioned gentapos. Kim Billy Leipold commented: This is indeed inspirational. I used to do this when I was a kid, but not with car washing instead in our shoe factory. I help every weekend and summer vacations to earn money, helping to put on shoelaces, polish shoes and box them. As my parents taught meI was something I have to earn it either with good grades or by working! This kid will be in the future very successful! Kudos Kid! Christopher Brazell wrote: This is phenomenal! If he continues in this way, heaposs not going to need to be calling around asking for work, people will be calling him. Great job goes to the young man, and also the family who influences an incredible attitude towards work and reward. Hats off to you! And great job picking the milkshake place over McDonaldaposs!

Coffee Caye is a .-acre uninhabited tropical paradise off the coast of Belize and is now better known as the Principality of Islandia. The island, which is shaped a bit like a coffee bean, can be walked in just minutes. But its small size hasnapost stopped the micronation from claiming independence. In  the Letaposs Buy an Island project was started with the aim of crowdfunding for an island and by December  it had raised over £,. The group picked Coffee Caye, located just a -minute boat ride from Belize City, and forked out £, plus tax. Lets Buy an Island co-founder Marshall Mayer toldCNN: Who wouldnapost want to buy an island That feeling of stepping onto an island that youaposve invested in, and own, thataposs an amazing feeling. The idea for Islandia was actually born  years ago when co-founder and CEO Gareth Johnson bought the domain name letsbuyanisland, thinking that the idea sounded funny, The Daily Star reports.  After looking into it over a number of years the group realised that buying an island was much more realistic than they originally imagined. Investors can now buy shares in Islandia for £,, with each of the shareholders entitled to one vote in the micronationaposs democracy.  people have also bought citizenship for just £ without actually becoming an investor.Johnson toldCNN: Who hasnapost dreamed of making their own country  Particularly in a post-Trump, post-Brexit, Covid world. If a bunch of regular people can make this work, perhaps it can be a force for good.  Islandia now has its own flag, novelty passports, a national anthem and government elected by the investors. Johnson even joked that he has a special role as Head of the Secret Police. This year marked the first tour of the island, with Mayer taking a group of investors and tourists for a camping trip. Those going in the future will have to abide by a number of special rules such as aposno single-use plasticapos, although in reality it still falls under the jurisdiction of Belize. Put simply, a micronation is an entity whose members claim to be a sovereign state but arenapost recognised by world governments or major international organisations. The claims are so trivial that they are largely ignored by the countries around them.  One of the most notable examples is the Principality of Sealand, an anti-aircraft  in the North Sea built during World War Two and seized by a pirate radio group in . Sealand continues to assert its status as a nation by issuing its own money and stamps. The Free Republic of Liberland was founded in , sitting between Croatia and Serbia. Border disputes between the countries mean some land there is claimed by both or neither. Liberland has even established formal ties with Somaliland, a de facto state in the Horn of Africa.

A number of experts, analysts and academics have lambasted the approach taken by Putinaposs forces, who have suffered heavy losses with seemingly clueless attack strategies that have seen them often fail to make meaningful inroads into Ukraine ’s urban centres. One particularly baffling example of seeming ineptitude was highlighted when drone footage yesterday showed a column of Russian tanks being picked off one-by-one in an ambush by Ukrainian forces.Military experts and analysts were questioning how and why the Russian tank commanders allowed themselves to walk straight into a death trap, driving down the middle of a main road. Multiple sources have agreed that so far the number of tanks lost by Putin’s army is so great it exceeds the number owned by the entire German army. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  The devastating artillery attacks in Broy destroyed a number of Russian T- tanks and other vehicles. The ambush added to Moscow’s misery that has been compounded by heavier than expected losse, the onset of freezing temperatures and reported low morale among troops.Reports said that Russia ’s th tank regiment escaped with minimal casualties but commander Andrei Zakharov was reportedly killed, sending troops into panic mode and the unit into retreat.Franz-Stefan Gady, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the fight highlighted the danger of not securing urban territory before advancing. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog He said on Twitter : Fight shows the danger of not securing urban terrain with adequate infantry plus recon. assets when main elements of a force pass through urban terrain ideally suitable for ambushes.Rob Lee, a Senior Fellow and military expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that the ambush displayed “very poor tactics”.He tweeted: Very poor tactics displayed by this Russian armored force so close to Kyiv. Theyaposre well within range of Ukrainian artillery in Kyiv, theyaposre on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire.Similarly, the Austrian military’s research and development department proved that the column which was ambushed was a part of a larger Russian Battle Tactical Group.  They picked out some key points that led up to the ambush. The large group of Russian vehicles, at least  tanks, approached Kyiv on a main road in the north-east suburb of Broy. Given the size of the column, Ukrainian forces would have known it was coming and would have predicted it would take the route. The Russian commanders could have chosen to take a safer route around the densely built up residential area, but chose to simply push on.  Ukraine’s forces used a UAV spotter drone to pick the targets out from above, then began launching strikes from a safe distance. Despite the fact that missiles had already hit the road ahead and fields either side, the forces kept to the main road. The column used soviet-era movements, driving the vehicles bumper to bumper as they entered the chokepoint with houses either side. This meant they had only two escape routes, forwards onto Kyiv, or retreating.  Ukrainian artillery brought the column grinding to a halt in the village of Skybyn. The vehicles of the column were too tightly packed to move, leaving the Russians sitting ducks to Ukrainian fire. Drone footage shows artillery strikes narrowly missing the tanks, and one of the BTR- armoured carriers received a direct strike and explodes in flames. Another flank was also hit and destroyed. This left the column with no choice but a humiliating defeat, with tanks seen driving north-east away from Kyiv. This was but just one example of the poor tactics employed by the Kremlin’s forces that has turned what they planned to be a lightning invasion into a prolonged war. The true scale of Putin’s losses are unknown but Ukraine has claimed that it has killed over , troops, destroyed more than  tanks,  helicopters,  artillery units, , personnel carriers and nearly  planes. Military tracking website Oryx uses figures based on visual confirmation has suggested over , Russian vehicles have been destroyed, damaged, left behind, or captured by Ukraine so far.

Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabaeva - once described as “ Russia ’s most flexible woman“ - reportedly travelled to a “very private and very secure” chalet near here with the couple’s young children as the tanks rolled in.Widely believed to be the mother of Putin’s two sons and a daughter - or possibly two daughters - Kabaeva, , lives in a luxurious bubble, shielded from the horrors her -year-old partner is inflicting on innocent children.  Switzerland has a long history of providing low-tax secrecy to the world’s most powerful. Here, the Kremlin tyrant’s family is unlikely to be exposed.A source in Lugano, close to the Italian border, said: “Before the coronavirus pandemic there was often gossip about Putin’s mistress being in town. They are known to have strong connections here, but anyone who knows them has been sworn to secrecy.“While Russia falls apart because of the sanctions, this is the perfect place for Putin to send Alina and their kids.” Claims of Putin’s links to Lugano first surfaced seven years ago. In February , a local TV station reported that Kabeava had given birth at a private VIP maternity clinic in Sorengo, on the periphery of the city.  They were said to have reserved two rooms at the discreet private maternity hospital Clinic Sant’Anna - a favourite of wealthy Russians. One suite was for the birth the second for family and bodyguards. According to insiders, President Putin was present. The Kremlin, of course, dismissed the rumours, as it does any query about Putin’s private le. Kabaeva, one of the most decorated rhythmic gymnasts in history, has never confirmed whether they have one daughter, or twin girls. Likewise, neither has ever addressed claims they got married in a secret ceremony after Putin orced his first we. Bathed in balmy spring sunshine this week, the contrast between the restful serenity of the Sant’Anna and the maternity hospital bombed by Russian troops in Mariupol, Ukraine, could not be more stark.High-end clients drove expensive vehicles into an underground car park beneath a carefully manicured lawn, with a topiaried flamingo at the entrance. Birdsong could be heard in the little vineyard nearby. Meanwhile shells still pounded Mariupol at the other end of Europe, after heavily pregnant mums had been carried out on stretchers through the rubble. In Lugano’s glistening Piazza Della Rorma, where Kabeava is said to have been seen on occasions, grey-haired men stroll past the café terraces with statuesque supermodel girlfriends. Occasional snippets of Russian puncture predominantly Italian background chatter. It is a sedate place dominated by banks, pharmacies and designer goods, and restaurants with eye-wateringly expensive menus.  Above Lake Lugano, modernist four-storey villas with infinity pools are embedded into the mountains. Their owners drive directly onto the roof, and go downstairs in private elevators. These are perfect properties for people wanting to keep clear of prying eyes, Alina Kabaeva is not the only person close to Putin with links to Lugano. Oligarch Alexey Mordashov, Russia’s second-richest man with a personal fortune estimated at £bn last year, was added to the EU sanctions list last week. Steel and mining baron Mordashov, , was targeted because of Rossiya Bank, in which he has a stake.  Rossiya was described as the “personal bank” of Russian officials who benefited from the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in . The EU also said it believes media businesses Mordashov is invested in helped destabilise Ukraine through pro-Russian television stations. The export arm of Mordashov’s steel and mining empire, Severstal, is located in an anonymous office building in a drab industrial park in Manno, on the outskirts of Lugano. Mordashov’s below-the-radar presence is marked only on a list of business names on a sign in the car park. Last week the billionaire’s private jet was tracked as flying back to the Seychelles from Moscow. In a statement, Mordashov said he did not understand how his name was on the sanctions list, adding: “I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.”  Calling for an end to the current war, he went on: “It is terrible that Ukrainians and Russians are dying, people are suffering hardships, the economy is collapsing.” Russia’s richest .% - who together possess wealth greater than the remaining .% of the population - are not only attracted by Switzerland’s pleasant climate and stunning vistas. Recent data shows that around a third of their bank balances worldwide are in the Alpine nation. According to a  survey by ErnstYoung, banks in Zurich and Geneva are favoured by the oligarchs. Putin’s childhood friend from St Petersburg, Gennady Timchenko, was based in Switzerland until , when he was sanctioned by the US over the Crimean invasion. When Russia invaded Ukraine a fortnight ago, Timchenko was one of the first oligarchs sanctioned by Britain. Much of his wealth derived from being granted an oil export licence by Putin, his ice hockey buddy, in . He still owns a gigantic mansion on Lake Geneva. Like upmarket Belgravia in London, Switzerland has long been a playground for Putin’s oligarch friends with their limitless wealth. For Alina Kabaeva and Putin’s unseen children, it could also remain the ideal bolthole while her despot partner keeps shelling innocent civilians. Previously given high-profile political appointments because of her relationship, she is accustomed to obeying her bullying partner. As global outrage against Putin’s despicable war gets louder, the Ferraris and Lamborghinis still purr around Lake Lugano.

The plight of the Ukrainian people had me in tears and it feels heartless to turn away. I saw the Russian tank drive over a car, then people rush to rescue the driver, who was a white-haired old man. That set me off.Then I saw an old couple carefully walking along a few planks across a river, and I was gone. I thought of the fear I’d feel, the devastation at leaving my family home, knowing I’d find it destroyed evenI could . One film will stay with me for ever. It showed old ladies, maybe  or  years old, with headscarves tied under their chins. They were sewing green ribbons to nets to help camouflage the dads, brothers, sons and grandsons who have become soldiers to fight for their country. As they worked, they started singing Ukrainian songs and I was in floods at their bravery and solidarity.  We all feel helpless. Donating to aid charities is a good step. Even the Queen, who is back to work after Covid, displayed the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow in her flowers and clothes when she met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. I know it’s not much and it changes nothing, but when sorting my clothes for my trip to the mobility shop, I pinned a daffodil to my blue anorak so I can also show my support for Ukraine. Suddenly, all the usual moans seem silly. My garden needs a good tidy-up, but what does it matter when hospitals are being bombed in Ukraine  Petrol prices are through the roof, but we can all safely get buses, which they’d love to do in Ukraine. My parents always said war was a great leveller and now I know exactly what they meant. That’s why, as devastating as it is, we have to keep watching the news.  Arthritis means itaposs time to get a new set of wheels I have a big decision to make and can’t avoid it any longer. My arthritis is so bad I’ve been staying at home, scared my legs will give way when I’m trying to get in to a car, cafe or shop. Friends and family are encouraging me to venture out, but wobbling along with my stick or walker is too painful. Even when I have a friend holding me up on one side, I worry I’ll fall and pull my friend down with me – and they’re no spring chickens. Until now, I’ve chosen the safe option of staying home and trying not to feel too down about missing days out and chatty lunches. But my friends have had enough. This week, Janet visited the mobility shop and told me there were two good wheelchairs there – and I’ve agreed to go and see them. When my mum got a wheelchair, she cried and felt it was the start of the end. But she got used to it and we had so many laughs out with her chair. When I accidentally wheeled her into a big display of beautul Christmas baubles, her little voice came from deep within the tree branches: “Our Valerie! Help me!” I nearly wet myself. But now it’s my turn I don’t feel like laughing. So I’m trying my best to talk myself into it. My grandkids would love to see more of meI was able to get out in a wheelchair. Although Freddie, our Robert’s youngest, would push me around in wild circles. I’ll stick a giant L plate and go-faster stripes to my chair and get a horn to honk people out of my way. I’ll drape fairy lights around it for a festive look, but maybe hazard warning lights will be more apt.  Best of all, I can use the armrests to hang pouches of KP salted peanuts and Blue Ribands for snacks on the go. I’ll try to think of the wheelchair as the key to winning new independence and will imagine myself as a -year-old, getting my first car instead of an old lady confined to a wheelchair. My stubbornness and memories of my mum’s sadness is standing in the way of my new wheels. I need to get over it, just like mum did. Janet was delighted when I agreed to go to the mobility shop. Then she went back to the shop and said to the assistants: “Be warned.” Cloudberry jam is sweet relief When world events bear heavily, tiny specks of happiness can be found in little things. This week, mine came in a pot of jam. My friend Donna’s husband came back from Scandinavia with a new kind of jam for me to try. When she went into another room, I stuck my finger in the pot because I couldn’t wait. Cloudberry jam is the most delicious jam I’ve had in my le. The minute Donna waved goodbye, I finished the jam with a spoon – there was no time to spread it on bread.  As I spent the rest of the afternoon swigging Gaviscon, I thought, ‘Why don’t I learn from my past mistakes ’ But was it worth it  Oh yes. Had it lasted, the jam would have been lovely on the scones Sheila dropped round. She said: “Here’s four. You can freeze them.” I thought, freeze them  What’s she talking about  There’s no need. On day one, two were gone. The next day, bye bye to the other two… Our ace Andy is generous to a fault... God love Andy Murray, who has pledged all his prize money for this year to children in Ukraine. He is a wonderful role model and an example of the sportspeople coming up trumps in the face of a world crisis. I could eat him on a butty.  Rebooted classic was a real turn-off I taped the new Ipcress Files and was really excited as I settled down to watch it. But halfway through the first episode, I switched it off. I absolutely loved the Michael Caine version, but the new TV series isn’t a patch on it. I was so disappointed I couldn’t even enjoy the s style of fashion and furniture, which would usually make my memories soar back to when I spent my days shopping for minidresses rather than wheelchairs. When a film or TV show is perfect in its original form, why bother with a remake  If you’d like to contact Val, email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD.

Debate has been re over whether the pilot really exists, or is a purely mythical figure, but now the Ukrainian military has published a photo of the air ace. The pilot has been pictured flying a MiG- but with his face hidden behind a black visor and oxygen mask, meaning doubters are likely to remain. The image was captioned with a threat aimed at Russian pilots, reading: “Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!”When the invasion of Ukraine began, Russia had , combat-capable aircraft, including almost a hundred ,mph Su-S Flanker fighters, reported the Daily Star.By contrast Ukraine had just  combat-ready aircraft, and the most advanced fighter planes available to Ukrainian defenders were the air force’s  s-era MiG- Fulcrums.According to recent reports, a total of  Russian aeroplanes has been shot down, along with  helicopters, and two drones - while Ukraine has reportedly lost eight aeroplanes and three drones. As yet, the Russian air force has not achieved total air superiority, but even though the Ukrainian defences are bristling with portable anti-aircraft missiles, the numbers are in Putin’s favour. Samuel Cranny-Evans, a Research Analyst at the defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute, said that true or  the idea of the Ghost of Kyiv is fantastic propaganda. He told the Express : “I think the main thing to note is that as part of an information campaign, it’s very effective.“It does have precedent of course, reporting on German fighter aces for example, or Russian snipers with crazy high kill tallies in WW for example.” Mr Cranny-Evans said its possible that there is some truth to the tale but it is impossible to know one way or the other. He said: “Typically, information Warfare should contain a kernel of truth. So, it’s possible there is a ‘ghost of Kyiv’ who has been relatively successful.”President Volodymyr Zelensky has been appealing to NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country but Western leaders are wary of coming into direct conflict with Russian forces for fear of escalating the conflict into a nuclear showdown. US President Joe Biden has also rejected the suggestion that Poland loans its squadrons of Soviet-made MiG fighters to Ukraine.The US Defence Department’s John Kirby told reporters: “We do not support the transfer of the fighters to the Ukrainian air force at this time and have no desire to see them in our custody either”. He added that Pentagon analysts believed the jets wouldn’t materially improve Ukraine’s chances, but instead would increase the prospects of drawing NATO directly into the fight. As he launched his invasion of Ukraine, Putin warned anyone “who might be tempted to meddle in the ongoing events: whoever tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country … people should know Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history.

Veronika was born in the middle of a warzone after her mum was pictured bloodied among the wreckage of the disaster, which sparked international outrage. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here The world was shocked this week when shelling destroyed a children’s hospital, killing at least three people including a child and injuring many more. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed the childrenaposs hospital on Wednesday.The Russian embassy in London responded to the heinous attack by wildly claiming it was “long non-operational” and was used by Ukrainian radicals to attack their troops. Follow all todayaposs updates from Ukraine in our live blog In a shocking tweet removed by Twitter, the Russians seized on Marianaaposs beauty blogger status and claimed the photographed victim covered in blood had faked her injuries for a photo shoot.They claimed she had “played two victims” as propaganda against the war. Alongside pictures of the pregnant woman after the bombing - on which they emblazoned the word “fake” - the embassy wrote: “The maternity house was long non-operational.“Instead, it was used by [Ukrainian] armed forces and radicals, namely the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. Russia warned the UN Security Council about this three days ago.” In a follow up tweet they added: “It’s the indeed pregnant [Ukrainian] beauty blogger Marianna Podgurskaya. “She actually played roles of both pregnant women on the photos. “First photos were actually taken by famous propagandist photographer Evgeniy Maloletka, rather than rescuers and witnesses as one would expect.” Evgeniy Maloletka is in fact a photographer for respected news agency the Associated Press. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries retweeted the message and said: This is fake news.  The tweet was reported by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media  Sportand has since been removed with a note in its place saying: This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules. Ukraine officials have said that at least  people have been injured by the shelling that saw heavily pregnant women among the people brought out of the destroyed hospital on stretchers. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the attack as “depraved”.Sergei Orlov, the port cityaposs deputy said: Iaposm absolutely sure they know about this facility and this is the third hospital that they are destroying in this city.  He said a -bed hospital dedicated to treating Covid patients had been destroyed by artillery shelling the previous day, along with a blood-collection centre in Mariupol. Iaposm absolutely suretargets, Orlov added. Earlier today the Russian Defence Ministry said that Mariupol is completely surrounded after days of heavy artillery strikes. Russia has also reneged on a humanitarian corridor agreement to allow civilians to safely evacuate. But now the Kremlin says all the cityaposs bridges and approaches are destroyed, and roads have been mined by Ukrainian forces.

But with state media having backed the Ukrainian invasion the majority of Russians appear to seemingly be in support of the invasion - and it is Putinaposs control over journalists that has helped him to rule without any signicant opposition. Now, though, on a programme hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, a staunch supporter of Putin’s regime, guests openly criticised the attack on Ukraine with one saying it was like “Afghanistan but even worse.” The use of Afghanistan as an example is signicant in Russia as it is seen as a military humiliation - with the country having spent  years in the country before withdrawing in . Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Soloviyev has been peddling state propaganda even agreeing that the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol this week was “fake news” - claiming the building was now being used by Ukraine troops.He was left fuming, though, by comments on his Thursday night show where they questioned what the Russians were doing in Ukraine.Karen Shakhbnazarov, a filmmaker and political commentator, took a dig at the decision to invade Ukraine on the Russia  channel. “The war in Ukraine paints a frightening picture, it has a very oppressive influence on our society. Ukraine, whichever way you see it, is somewhere with which Russia has thousands of human links, he said, reported the Daily Beast.  The suffering of one group of innocents does not compensate for the suffering of other innocent people... I don’t see the probability of denazication of such an enormous country. We would need to bring in . million soldiers to control all of it. He added: The most important thing in this scenario is to stop our military action. Shakhbnazarov did toe the country’s line that the war was caused by the United States but he said that a “humanitarian disaster” would also see Russia’s allies like China and India distancing themselves.  The host, who is one the Russians to have been sanctioned by the EU and has had an Italian villa seized, was left annoyed by the analysis but other guests were also critical. Semyon Bagdasarov, a Russian Middle East expert, agreed with Shakhbnazarov and said that Russians need to prepare for total isolation. He drew the parallels with Afghanistan saying: Let Ukrainians do this denazication on their own. We can’t do it for them... As for their neutrality, yes, we should squeeze it out of them, and that’s it.  We don’t need to stay there longer than necessary... Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse  There are more people and they’re more advanced in their handling of weapons. We don’t need that. Enough already... As for the sanctions, the world has never seen such massive sanctions.” Other media shows have also given an insight into the war casualties in Ukraine with Russian soldiers dying, which is also going against the official line that the battle is going according to plan.

There are still major gaps on the UK’s list. Among those we have yet to take action against include the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Grigorenko, and Igor Osipov, the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea fleet. The case for action could not be more pressing when Putin is reported to be prepared to use chemical and biological weapons. He is committing crimes against humanity. There can be no delay in imposing sanctions on all those who are complicit in these war crimes.  Wary on virus Boris Johnson may believe that the Covid threat has passed but the figures tell a dferent story. More than two million people in England were infected with the virus last week, with those needing hospital treatment up %. There is also evidence the new Deltacrom iant is starting to get a foothold in Britain. Given the virus remains so virulent the Government should halt plans to scrap free testing and the removal of financial support for those who need to self-isolate. We should not be dropping our guard while lives remain at risk. D’oh, David Comedian David Mitchell says he doesn’t see the point of catchphrases. Don’t panic! Other comics still like using them, but not a lot.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a -

Alex McKinven’s letter in the February  edition of the Courier titled ‘Any Dalintober developments must be sensitive’, hopefully I can give an assurance on behalf of Argyll Community Housing Association .Despite the merits or otherwise of a debate on aesthetic value with respect to the Dalintober buildings, they do not meet the needs of ACHA’s current or future tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the last  years and we believe that our proposal for Dalintober and our consultation for Saddell Street and Queen Street will take that forward.My we and I have recently received from the pension service a note of our increase in the state pension from April  .The increase is . per cent whilst, by that time, inflation is expected to be in excess of . per cent.Therefore, this published increase is actually a decrease in real terms of . per cent.This is, of course, due to the triple lock guarantee being abolished by Rishi Sunak.I was pleased, however, to be informed that upon reaching my th birthday in December this year,I am still here, I can look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent gales.Perhaps I should rely upon the Scottish Government being in a position to capture one of the flying pigs overhead to fund my state pension when independence is achieved.Yeah, that’s right!"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 25 2022","story":"I remember her mixing

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

This in my opinion is a prime example of a failure to do so.The council leader talks a great deal about environmentalism but how is this environmental This is particularly saddening given the fact that so many teachers often struggle for ample educational booklets.My constituents are asking why our council taxes are having to go up when mountains of perfectly good books are being thrown in the skip It is beyond belief that this can be allowed to happen.

season.The new six-part series, Trigger Point, follows the dangerous lives of counterterrorism and bomb disposal police officers and stars Vicky McClure, who will also appear in our Line of Duty reunion.Mercurio’s contribution to Sunday evening entertainment was recognised in , when he collected an OBEfrom Princess Anne at Windsor Castle for his services to television drama.Writing on Twitter, he said he was “humbled” and “honoured”, especially among others who he said had “achieved so much more, in particular, for their charity work and in the Covid pandemic”.Mercurio did his own bit for charity during Covid-, by taking to social media to encourage fans to bid in a charity auction which raised around £.k help provide free PPE for healthcare staff.The showrunner has also given back to the entertainment community, offering free online writing classes for aspiring screenwriters, passing on the tricks of the trade that he has learned from his  years in the industry.His advice to those hoping to emulate his success has been frank: “You need to work hard at your writing, you need to keep trying.“You constantly need to be generating material, and eventuallyyou keep doing that, you’ll be successful.”Mercurio has been quiet on whether Line of Duty wouldto thrill fans for another series, but perhaps the reunion will coax out some new information about the future of the widely loved series.The exclusive video will only be available to our subscribers.You can pay as little as £ for your first month and that fee will go directly to Martins favourite charity, Ardgowan

 years to the day since the release of the single Anarchy in the UK by the Sex Pistols, the band managed by Corre’s father Malcolm McLaren and clothed by his mother Vivienne Westwood.Corre was protesting against a year-long anniversary celebration of punk in London endorsed by the likes of the British Library, the Museum of London and the office of the Mayor of London . The kind of people, Corre complained, who would have hated punk back in the s.As a result, Corre took John Lydon’s final sentiment in Anarchy in the UK – “Destroy” – to heart. He announced he was going to burn some of his own collection of punk memorabilia.And so, on the river on this particular November day effigies of ious politicians – David Cameron, George Osborne and May herself – were put to the torch, along with a chest containing clothes, posters and other memorabilia worth, Corre claimed, £ million.It was that figure that caught the eye of the media and caused a small scandal at the time. Corre was burning important cultural artefacts, some said. Sell the collection and give the money to charity, others argued. Newspaper columnists labelled Corre attention-seeking and juvenile.He went ahead anyway and had film maker Nigel Askew record the event. Now five-and-a-half years later a documentary about the event is receiving its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival this evening.Wake Up Punk is a film about what punk meant then and still means now. It’s also about Corre’s parents who were also, one could say, the parents of punk, and Corre’s relationship with them. In passing it also tackles the idea of news as entertainment and empty spectacle.And it’s a film about Corre’s self-belief and, critics might say, self-importance. Which is the very thing that makes him fun to talk to, of course. In our time together he’s mouthy, outspoken, dismissive of others’ opinions and often quite funny into the bargain.It’s a Thursday morning in February when we talk via Zoom. I’m at home, he’s in his office in Clerkenwell. In the background people ghost past as he talks about his past, his parents, and about lingerie and bondage trousers.“The title of the film Wake Up Punk is really a message to those people to say wake up and actually see what’s important,” Corre explains. “Don’t try to be nostalgic about something that was never meant to be nostalgic. It was something that was very current at the time and then lost its energy. There’s no point trying to resurrect that energy in an old way.”Joe Core. Photograph Paul Stuart One of the things Corre rails against – in the film and in person – is the commodication of the idea of punk Virgin’s Sex Pistols credit card, McDonald’s using Buzzcocks to sell peri peri chicken wraps, BrewDog’s Punk IPA.Punk, Corre suggests, has become a meaningless word. “It’s on a bottle of beer. If you drink that beer, you’re a punk  ‘I pay for my McDonald’s with my Never Mind the Bollocks credit card because I’m so alternative.’ It’s pathetic really.”Corre’s position on all this is not welcomed by everybody. Wake Up Punk, to its credit, acknowledges as much. At one point we are reminded that Corre has been dismissed as the “Eric Trump of Punk” . And there’s a sequence at a public event where Corre is gunning for everyone and more than a few are gunning back. He is even labelled a bully.“When you stick your head above the parapet people hate you for it,” Corre suggests. He’s known this all his le, he says. Born in , he was just a kid when his parents were at the heart of the punk media storm“It’s very memorable to me as a young kid growing up through that time how much people hated you. Grown men would come and spit in my face in the street. The National Front came outside our flat and smashed all our windows and threw fireworks in. We had death threats on the phone, turds through the letter box. My parents’ shop in the King’s Road was smashed up every weekend by Cha football fans.”Every day, Corre reminds me, the tabloids were “drumming up hatred” against punk rockers.“It was manufactured hatred. And to stand up and do things at that time it took a hell of a lot of courage. Malcolm was there … some of the time. Most of the time he was hiding around a corner. So, he’d cause the aggravation and then disappear and let someone deal with it.”Your mum presumably “Vivienne always looked so incredibly glamorous and sexy. Those clothes that she designed at that time were the most glamorous thing you’d ever seen. But at the same time, she also looked like some kind of alien had landed from space because you’d never seen anyone like that. I would be literally walking up the road with her and cars would be crashing because she looked so amazing.”Add to that, “she’s got a disarming quality to anyone who ever wanted to be aggressive towards her,” he says. “She’s very disarming in that way.”Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood in the s Corre is, as you may have already gathered, slightly in awe of his mum. His dad, maybe not so much. In the past he has been highly critical of McLaren .With good reason, you might think. McLaren walked out on his family when Corre was barely into his teens. But the film suggests a rather more complex push-and-pull in Corre’s attitude towards his father. There is a lot of animus still, but there’s also a recognition of his father’s achievements.“People don’t understand the brilliance of him,” Corre says of McLaren. “I think it’s a bit of a shame that the information out there about Malcolm really focuses on his megalomania and all his bullshit really and doesn’t actually let you see the man himself who did some really brilliant things.”He tells me a story from childhood, from the pre-punk years. “When I was a really small kid my mother was a schoolteacher in south London and Malcolm was at art school. Vivienne taught a class which today would be called special needs. And within the space of about a year, a year and a half, that class had become the top class in the school.“None of those kids had ever been to the countryside so Malcolm and Vivienne and me and Ben [Corre’s half-brother] used to take these kids on these weekend outings. We’d turn up at the train station in the morning and Malcolm would get a couple of packets of sausages out of the shop. We’d get on the train and go down to Kent and just walk and they would have this incredible adventure. Malcolm was so neurotic and so full of wild energy he could make a fire by rubbing sticks together. He’d start a fire and cook the sausages and the kids would go wild for it.”He smiles at the memory.“He was great in that way. I guess he really identied with kids because I think he always identied himself as some kind of naughty child.“There’s a lot of aspects to Malcolm that I don’t think have been understood or shared. There’s a little bit of it in this film. So, what I can say is that, yeah, he was never really a father. But there were things about him that were fantastic and things that I treasure about him.“There were other times in my le where he really was there for me, and it was good to have him there.”Joe Corre. Photograph Paul Stuart McLaren died in . I wonderCorre has come to a dferent understanding of his father since his death “Yeah, I think so. One of the slightly painful things to me about this film, and the books that have come out about him, and the lies that are still told, is that through all of that is it hasn’t allowed me to close the book on it. It’s always there or thrown back at you.“I’m kind of hoping with this film, it’s kind of the end of it, and I don’t have to talk about it or think about it anymore.“He had a very disturbed childhood in many ways. What can you say that isn’t trite  But then he did things that I could never imagine doing. Hurtful things.”Well, yes. One of the revelations of the film is that Corre, after organising and co-ordinating a huge funeral for his father, then learned that McLaren, on his death bed has bluntly, hurtfully written him out of his will.“I don’t know why he wrote that will in that state of mind,” Corre admits. “All I know is thatI had been in that position, I could never have written those words about my child. I’d rather die … I know he was dying … I could never have done it and he did and that’s the end of that.“I didn’t want anything from him. I wasn’t expecting anything from him. But the thing that hurt was to write in that will, ‘My son will not inherit anything whatsoever.’ That’s the thing that hurts. So, you know … Anyway.”You could say that the story of Corre’s own le is the story of someone who had learned all of the lessons his father taught how to put on a show, how to get noticed, how to inject himself into the culture.When he and his then we Serena Rees set up Agent Provocateur, the upmarket lingerie brand, in , Corre knew how to get the media’s attention whether it was by having an Agent Provocateur-clad Kylie Minogue filmed on a bucking Bronco or dressing upthe likes of Kate Moss and Maggie Gyllenhaal in his lingerie.Agent Provocateur store. Photograph PA One could argue, I suppose, that for all his complaints about the commodication of punk he made his fortune commodying sexuality.“I’ve always been independent,” he says when I suggest as much. “When I started Agent Provocateur, I certainly took a leaf out of my parent’s book in terms of using your shop as a way to communicate ideas over and above simply sales. The ideas that I was pushing at that time were about … Well, I think we’d come out of that time in the late eighties of power dressing and big shoulders and women saying, ‘We can be as powerful as men, we can sit on the board of these companies, and we can do what we want.’“And, in some ways, by doing that it had kind of taken away the power of their femininity. You’ve got something special here and there’s nothing wrong with showing it off.“Later on, I have to say, after doing it for ,  years or something it became a business. The bigger something like that gets the more anti-creative it becomes.“In the end it becomes run by bean counters. And you spend your entire time arguing against the bean counters, and that’s not a great creative process to be in. And it certainly got to the point for me where it was like, I’m out of this.”His marriage broke upand the business was sold to a private equity house for £ million.Corre set up another fashion label A Child Of The Jagoon a much smaller scale and became more politically active. If his father was a mischief-maker and his mother got by with her charm, their son is a fighter.Corre and his mother Vivienne Westwood protesting against fracking “I wanted to get much more involved in political activism and the thing that grabbed me particularly was the fracking industry.”He did his bit in the resistance to fracking coming to the UK. He launched court cases, spoke to the media, protested, hired, he says, guards to protect other protesters.“I looked at it from a business point of view, to say thatI’m really going to make this thing work, I’ve got to be prepared to get involved in all these things. It’s not just about me going out with a banner saying, ‘Stop fracking.’”In  the UK government did a U-turn and did just that. “It took like seven years or something, but we won in the end,” Corre says.One of the keys to the campaign, he says, was understanding how the media works. The need for a good story. You could say that figure of £m he suggested for the worth of the punk memorabilia he torched was another example of that process at work. It’s a nice round figure, isn’t it Near the end of our conversation, I ask him, did the burning of the memorabilia work “If you’ve seen this film and at the end you are still asking that question you’ve kind of missed the point,” he says, putting me in my place. “Because the film is about asking people to question what they really value.“People have got to be responsible for their own actions and reactions, and that’s the message of the film. Was it worth it for me  Well, I guess we’ll see how good the film is. But I don’t have any regrets. I’d do the same thing tomorrow. I think I made the point I wanted to make.”Wake Up Punk has its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Theatre tonight as part of the Glasgow Film Festival. It also screens tomorrow at .pm. Visit glasgowfilm.orgWake Up Punk’s director Nigel Askew on Joe Corre and his parents:Why did you want to film the burning of the memorabilia I thought it was an important statement. It was a big statement to make that the authorities don’t own punk.I was documenting what was happening. And making suggestions of who we should talk to about it. But, of course, nobody wanted to talk to us. When it happened, Joe was like the worst demon on the planet and nobody wanted to know.The film offers a dferent vision of Vivienne Westwood than we normally see.For me, that was one of the most important things in the film, to show Vivienne not as a crazy person, because that’s how journalists tend to portray her. I wanted to have her as her true self with her sons. I think that came across.How do you view Joe Corre He really stands up for people. People were very unhappy when we started this film and I just hope they understand Joe better when they see the end result.In the film he acknowledges his father’s part in the story.Yeah, they had a dficult relationship. But, overall, Joe really respects his father for what he did and what he achieved. In my mind, he’s really sticking up for Malcolm’s point of view."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-nisebt-using-world-cup-dreams-motivation-return-horror-acl-injury","story":"The Hibernian striker was injured in a challenge with Celtic’s Carl Starfelt almost a fortnight ago and received the dreaded news that he had damaged his anterior cruciate ligamentduring a visit to see specialist Andy Williams in London earlier this week.The -year-old went under the kne on Thursday and his y rehabilitation could preclude him from playing until the eve of the World Cup in Qatar in late November.However, should Scotland’s bid to qualy for the finals prove successful this summer, manager Shaun Maloney is convinced it will prove a powerful tool in driving the former Dunfermline and Raith Rovers marksman in his recovery.“Kevin got his surgery [on Thursday] and it went well,” explained Maloney. “It’s an ACL and that injury tends to take seven to nine months.“I know from speaking to Kevin he is very motivated,Scotland qualy, which I am very hopeful they do, that he can make it back to push for that squad. But it’s going to be a long time, so we’ll try and support him as much as possible.“I went to London to meet him before his surgery. Look, it has been a little period since the Celtic game where he did it, so he was at a stage where he was positive and eager to get the surgery and start his rehab.“It’s a really dficult injury but Kevin is very positive about coming back a better player.“We’ve all seen players before do this, where they have had a major injury or a big setback and have come back a better player. And that has to be Kevin’s motivation, that when he comes back, he comes back with the mindset to become the best striker in the league.“I think in these moments you always need sources of motivation, and the World Cup being possible for him gives him a really big target.“I do love the fact he is speaking about trying to make that squad,and when Scotland do hopefully get there. And rightly so, it should be a big motivation for him to get back in time and to show everyone he is coming back a better player.”Nisbet himself insists he is not short of motivation in overcoming a devastating setback.He said on Hibs’ Twitter: “Just ing back from London where top knee specialist Andy Williams operated on my left knee.“He’s delighted with they way the op went and is sure I’ll be back stronger and better than ever. I’d like to thank him and his team for looking after me so well and also Hibs for acting so quickly.“It’s a massive disappointment that I won’t be able to help the manager and my team-mates in the final matches of this season but I know they’ll do everything possible to make sure our fans have something to celebrate.“In a bit of pain, which is to be expected, but I’m already focused on what needs to be done during rehabilitation.“I can assure everyone that I will be back as quickly as possible and ready to do my best for both Hibs and Scotland.”The news has cast a shadow over Hibs’ preparations for tomorrow’s Scottish Cup quarter-final against Motherwell.However, Maloney is now desperate for the Easter Road side to shake off a hat-trick of goalless draws and show a ruthless streak to get back to Hampden, where they lost out in last season’s Scottish Cup final and this season’s League Cup final.“I do love the fact of how good we are defensively but there is a balance,” said Maloney, who admitted there was no place in his backroom team for Scott Brown but pledged to help his former Celtic team-mate’s coaching journey. “At the moment the balance is we are incredibly strong defensively but in that final area that’s where the work has to go into.“It feels like we can get into that area a lot but it’s just that final sort of action to create a chance and then take it. There’s been a lot of games where we have had numerous chances and we have not been ruthless enough.“I’d imagine that’s where the dference will be this weekend. Whoever gets the chances and is ruthless enough, that’s who the victory will fall to.”"},{"url":null,"title":"italy-27-scotland-13-scotlands-miserable-run-results-u20-six-nations-continues","story":"The home team were utterly dominant in the set piece from the first scrums of the evening and in one period of the game appeared able to steal lineout ball at will.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The importance of thermostatsFitting thermostats can help monitor the room temperature and will automatically switch your boiler on and off to maintain the set temperature you so desire.You can even get wireless thermostats so you don’t have to track your walls.Thermostatic radiator valves can also be easily fitted, allowing you to control the temperature in each room inidually.By installing a smart thermostat to cool down your home in the summer months, for example, this can lower the demand for electricity produced by power plants and, in turn, reduce global warming causing carbon emissions.. Reduce your temperature by just °CBy reducing the temperature of your home, it doesn’t mean you need to get the woolly jumpers and thick socks out just yet. But by lowering your thermostat by just °C you could save over £ per yearyou have one or more room thermostats.According to Element Energy, the UK would save . million tonnes of COeveryone carried out such a decrease, so not only would this small change save the planet, but can also save on your bills.. Try going fossil freeOne of the biggest ways to save the planet and properly green-proof your home would be to eradicate all dependence on fossil fuels such as gas or home heating oil.One of the best alternatives is to install an air source heat pump run off electricity. Heat pumps are believed to be up to three times more efficient than a boiler and can signicantly reduce your energy bills and your carbon footprint.Heat pumps can also provide cooling in summer, as well as heating in winter, but are more costly than other heating options.. Reduce your water wasteBy reducing your water usage, you are reducing carbon pollution due to the energy needed to pump, heat and treat it.Take shorter showers, even by just a couple of minutes, and turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth.Only run full loads of washing, both in the washing machine and dishwasher. It is also best for the environment to wash clothes at °C or °C rather than °C, as it’s around % cheaper and uses much less energy.. Use energy-efficient appliancesWhen buying appliances such as fridges, microwaves and kettles, look out for its energy label and pick the appliance which operates most efficiently for its size .Buying wisely is the lowest-cost way to reduce emissions. By reducing your energy usage, you in turn reduce the demand for fossil fuels, which will lower the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Some of the most energy consuming appliances in your home are fridges, freezers, washing machines, tumble dryers, and dishwashers.When boiling the kettle, only boil the water you need, as the more water you use the more energy is required to get it to boiling point.. Turn appliances off standby modeStandby is the energy used by certain appliances when not in use and not switched off at the plug.As well as standby power, other new additions to the average household’s collection of electrical goods, such as broadband modems, broadband routers, smart speakers and digi-boxes use low levels of electricity when not in use.We tend not to think to switch these off, but as they’re often on for  hours a day, these appliances gradually consume a great deal of electricity and in turn, a great deal of energy.Turning off standby can also cut your annual power bills by up to %.. Buy better bulbsLED lightbulbs use up to % less energy than conventional incandescent bulbs.LEDs require less power than regular forms of lighting, so obviously the less energy they require, the more positive the effect on the environment.For example, a simple incandescent bulb results in , pounds of CO annually, while LED bulbs contribute only  pounds of CO per year.So, not only are they the cheaper option, but by simply switching out your bulbs for LEDs you are reducing your overall carbon footprint.. Pull the plugOn average, the outlets in your home are likely powering about  dferent devices at any given time.Audio and video devices, cordless vacuums and power tools, and other electronics use energy even when they’re not charging.This ‘idle load’ all adds up to your total energy usage, so it is important not to leave fully charged devices plugged in.Try to remember to unplug rarely used devices or plug them into power strips and timers and adjust your computers and monitors to automatically power down to the lowest power mode when not in use.. Turn off lightsThis may seem like an obvious one, but many people still don’t turn off lights when they leave the room.Turning them off evenyou leave the room for a few minutes can help reduce your overall energy output and reliance on greenhouse gases.Lighting controls are a great way to save energy in the home, such as motion detectors, timers or dimmer switches which can control your lights automatically and efficiently.Motion sensors eliminate the need to keep turning lights on and off and dimmers can control your wattage output.. Go solarSolar energy can help you become more sustainable at home, using less carbon while also cutting your bills.Powering your home with solar  is better for the environment than using fossil fuels and can reduce your reliance on the grid.When fossil fuels are burned to produce electricity, they emit harmful gases that are the primary cause of air pollution and global climate change. Solar  can provide a greener alternative to this. While the  can be expensive to install and buy, the money will be saved in the long-run.. Buy eco-friendlyMaking a conscious effort not to bring plastic into the home is a good way to adopt a more eco-friendly mindset.Try switching your bottles of soap for bars of soap switch cleaning products to a brand that uses less chemicals remember to bring bags for le or reusable bags for shopping, and buy fruit and vegetables fresh, without plastic packaging.Having a good recycling system in place in your kitchen for you to organise rubbish creates more awareness of these small changes inside the home and makes recycling easier.. Double or triple-glaze windowsModern double or triple-glazed windows will help reduce draughts and increase the heat retention throughout your home.Some of the latest triple-glazing systems have a similar u-valueas a modern, fully insulated masonry wall.In addition to retaining heat, double and triple-glazing can also cut down on noise pollution from outside.If you live in an old home with single-glazing and this is not an option financially, you can always simply add heavier curtains.. Keep the draught outDraught-proofing your home not only ensures it is kept warm, but can also help you save on heating bills and avoid unnecessarily turning on the heating and burning fossil fuels.Simply closing curtains and internal doors, as well as using draught excluders around windows and under doors, could save you around £ a year.In addition to fabric draught excluders, you can also use silicone, expandable foam or mastic products.. Hang washing out to dryTry it the old-fashioned way and ditch the dryer. Tumble dryers can use up to five times more power than a washing machine, so why not put up a washing line outside and let clothes dry naturally in the fresh air — weather permitting.Hanging clothes out to dry can avoid unnecessary heat damage caused by tumble dryers while also saving energy and protecting the environment.It is thought that air drying clothes can reduce the average household’s carbon footprint by approximately ,lbs annually.. Install a water buttA water butt, in essence, can be a container of any size or shape that is used to collect and store rainwater.Collected water can then be used to water plants and even clean cars.The energy costs associated with treating and pumping water are massive, so any water savings are automatically carbon savings too.Most water butts are also made from hardwearing recycled plastic, so your purchase helps to support this green industry and keep a chunk of useful material out of landfill.. Leak proof your homeMake sure to regularly check for leaks, whether it be a tap, toilet or even windows and doors.It is believed a dripping tap over the course of a year could fill around two baths with wasted water.Check your roof regularly for tiles or slates which may have moved in storms.If any are broken or loose make sure they are repaired to ensure a leak-free roof. Pipes and guttering should also be inspected and cleaned regularly.. Upgrade your boilerAn old, inefficient boiler can be very poor at converting fuel into heat, sometimes operating at % efficiency and lower.Upgrading your existing boiler to, for example, a new condensing boiler, could be up to % more efficient.A condensing boiler recovers more heat from the exhaust flue gas and uses it to heat the central heating water, making it more efficient than older boilers, saving money and energy.. Increase insulation around hot water cylinderFor the same reasons as upgrading your boiler, increasing the insulation around your hot water cylinder will keep the water in it hotter for longer, reducing the need for your boiler to switch on to keep reheating the water.This is a more cost-efficient methodthe option of upgrading your boiler or heating system entirely is not financially viable.. Radiator reflectorsBy simply installing reflectors behind radiators throughout your home you can help prevent that heat from being lost by reflecting it back into the room.Some brands can reflect almost % of the heat from the radiator’s back into your home, cutting down the heat loss that usually takes place through the walls.By reflecting the heat back into the home, you will be able to reduce the amount of times your boiler will be turned on and off throughout the day, saving energy and money.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestion PremiumSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedClimate change: Northern Ireland’s love affair with the car is poisoning very air we breathe PremiumFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyNI environmentalists claim ‘bad planning and corruption’ damaging landscape and healthMost ReadHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarFamous Belfast landmark ‘the balls on the Falls’ features on The ChaseExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Northern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayHistorical abuse survivors rubbish apology from institutions but praise MLAsLatest EnvironmentAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestionSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedClimate change: Northern Ireland’s love affair with the car is poisoning very air we breatheFrom Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth to Blue Planet – how environmentalism info is just a click awayFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyLatestRussians push towards Kyiv as siege of other cities goes on‘People here are in panic’ after Russian air strikes, says Dnipro citizenChile’s new leftist president, , vows to combat inequalityCan we fix it  Yes, we can, thanks to Northern Ireland’s first tool lending libraryCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Use of face masks in classrooms to be removed for post-primary pupils,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Encouraging them to make friendships, develop as young people and fully embrace everything that le can offer them.“The only problem for me is that every time the work gets recognised this way the more work I have to do. More kids come!”  Our #OneBigThankYou goes to Jahswill from Belfast, who was subjected to a racially motivated attack and decided to make a stand.  He started a charity which encourages people from all backgrounds to get together and play sport.⚽��@TommyBowe helped us surprise him.#TheOneShow pic JFbTvl — BBC The One ShowMarch ,    Jahswill’s story has been told and last year his efforts were rewarded when he was named as Charity Champion in the Spirit of Northern Ireland awards.The rewards keep coming and the more that land in his lap, the more determined he becomes to keep it going and the Northern Ireland he’s working his magic in today is a far cry from the one he first arrived in back in .Originally from Nigerian, and now a dad of three, Jahswill said his time living in London before arriving in Belfast has been a struggle.“My cousin lived here and he said I should come over as it was a really peaceful place,” he said.“When I arrived, there were no African shops and we had to use an Asian shop. Now it is so erse you have shops for everyone as there has been such a growth in ersity and multi-cultural communities here.“Every year there are more cultures, more people from dferent backgrounds, and they all need a little help to make them feel at home. That’s where I have tried to help.” Jahswill set up MSCNI in , four years after he was left seriously injured in a vicious racist attack while on duty as a security guard in Belfast. It left him with post-traumatic stress disorder.“A guy came up to enter the premises and I told him that he couldn’t,” he said of the incident that changed his le.“Next thing there was a big bang around my jaw. He punched me and broke my jaw and I had to get my mouth wired.“He called me a ‘black b’ and told me to go back to my own country.Too afraid to leave home and left struggling with anxiety and depression for years afterwards, he decided the only way to recover was to try and tackle the issue by helping to integrate Northern Ireland’s erse community.“It affected me really badly and I started withdrawing from people. I got a lot of counselling but it wasn’t working,” he said.“I realised it was going to destroy me and the only way around it was to do something to help people but how do you help people when you are depressed.“I’m naturally a jovial person and I like to see people smile and when they smile it encourages me a lot. I love to see the beauty of ersity and people living in harmony.“We started the charity to bring people together through the medium of sport and we also organise cultural events.”It’s been all hands to the pump for Jahswill since then.The charity has grown and brought hundreds of kids together who have found a home in Belfast from all corners of the world.“I’m always amazed at the thanks,” he said. “As a group we are now as erse as the young people we try to bring together. ButI can do it, someone  can too.“Seeing that the effort is really appreciated always gives you new reasons to keep it going and that’s what I’ll do,” he said.“There are more people from erse societies in Belfast than ever before so the work is getting harder, but seeing the smiles on faces is worth it.“That’s my biggest joy. The help and support of so many people has made it all much easier.”Most ReadHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarFamous Belfast landmark ‘the balls on the Falls’ features on The ChaseExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Northern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest BelfastIRA raid on Castlereagh Police Station: ‘People think they know what happened, but they’ve only seen a fraction of it’‘Glory to Ukraine’: Message of support for Ukraine loud and clear at Belfast rallyEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastBelfast councillors urge public to ‘give generously’ to people of UkraineBelfast’s oldest swim club disbands after  yearsLatestRussians push towards Kyiv as siege of other cities goes on‘People here are in panic’ after Russian air strikes, says Dnipro citizenNewry City insist Irish FA mustn’t bow to Glentoran’s legal threat after throwing east Belfast giants out of the Irish CupChile’s new leftist president, , vows to combat inequalityCan we fix it  Yes, we can, thanks to Northern Ireland’s first tool lending library,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

inequality that he said are the unacceptable underbelly of a free market model imposed decades ago by General Augusto Pinochet, who ruled from  to .“We come to give ourselves body and soul to making le better in our country,” he said in a speech from a balcony of the government building, calling for unity to make Chile “a dignied and just country”.“The road will undoubtedly be long and dficult,” he said.His four-year term begins at a moment when a constituent assembly is drawing up a new constitution for the country to replace one adopted under Pinochet.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cbc-c-b-ac-eafbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news c .ece AUTOCROP w

shoulders during the ceremony in the legislative chambers in the port city of Valparaiso.Soon afterward, Mr Boric swore in the leader of what he has called a “feminist” cabinet — which includes  women and  men.Ostentatiously informal, the bearded young leader declined to wear a tie for the inauguration.Mr Boric won % of the vote in a December run-off against conservative Jose Antonio Kast.While his election initially scared investors, causing drops in stock prices and the peso, he has since stressed a pragmatic streak, vowing to maintain fiscal responsibility and naming a respected economist, former Central Bank president Mario Marcel, as finance minister.“We are going to have to make the changes step by step becausenot, the risk of falling back is too great,” he said recently — a stance that may be enforced by the fact his leftist coalition has only  of the  seats in congress.Even adding other centre-left parties, his allies fall just short of a majority.Chile has long been seen as one of Latin America’s greatest economic success stories, bolstered in part by its vast mineral industries.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news caf .ece AUTOCROP w

egalitarian distribution of wealth.Boric takes office as well at a moment when large-scale immigration from Venezuela and other countries has caused unrest in northern Chile while violent protests by some Indigenous rights activists demanding historic territories have caused clashes in the south.It’s also a moment of international turmoil due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.Boric has called for greater taxes on the wealthy to help finance improved health care, education and a universal pension plan to replace a privately run system that has proven inadequate for many.He has also pushed for a higher minimum wages and the creation of more jobs for women, in particular.He also campaigned for greater environmental protections in a country famed for its enormous copper mines.Any changes may result less from Boric than from a new constitution.The assembly drafting it is due to finish this year, offering it to voters for ratication or rejection.In his speech, Mr Boric said he hopes when his term ends in four years, we “feel that it is a country that protects us, that welcomes us, that takes care of us and guarantees our rights and justly

He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"arm na poblachta claim explosive device aimed at psni car in co derry ","story":"SDLP councillor Orla Beattie"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaPolitics Long-awaited stadia scheme ‘crucial for boosting women’s game’ Dominic McGrath, PALestyle Sinn Fein minister accused of failing football over stadia funding delays Jonathan McCambridge, PAPeople British agent was IRA prisoner and SF organiser Henry McDonaldPolitics Latest in series of anti-protocol rallies set for Co Down By The NewsroomOpinion Bids to establish fate of explorers are a tribute to the men who died EditorialCrime ‘Madness’ says PSNI after young driver caught speeding at  mph Gemma Murray News Hillsborough Castle gears up for Platinum Jubilee celebrations Graeme CousinsNews PSNI apologise for ‘any inconvenience caused’ Gemma Murray to the rescue!\" href\" lestyle food-and-drink st-patrick-and-zero-alcohol-rose-to-the-rescue-\" to the rescue!\" href\" lestyle food-and-drink st-patrick-and-zero-alcohol-rose-to-the-rescue-\"Lestyle to the rescue!\" href\" lestyle food-and-drink st-patrick-and-zero-alcohol-rose-to-the-rescue-\" St Patrickto the rescue!

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

the legislative chambers in the port city of Valparaiso.Soon afterward, Mr Boric swore in the leader of what he has called a “feminist” cabinet — which includes  women and  men.Ostentatiously informal, the bearded young leader declined to wear a tie for the inauguration.Mr Boric won % of the vote in a December run-off against conservative Jose Antonio Kast.While his election initially scared investors, causing drops in stock prices and the peso, he has since stressed a pragmatic streak, vowing to maintain fiscal responsibility and naming a respected economist, former Central Bank president Mario Marcel, as finance minister..remove“We are going to have to make the changes step by step becausenot, the risk of falling back is too great,” he said recently — a stance that may be enforced by the fact his leftist coalition has only  of the  seats in congress.Even adding other centre-left parties, his allies fall just short of a majority.Chile has long been seen as one of Latin

led by Mr Boric, demanding better education, pensions and health care, as well as a more egalitarian distribution of wealth.Boric takes office as well at a moment when large-scale immigration from Venezuela and other countries has caused unrest in northern Chile while violent protests by some Indigenous rights activists demanding historic territories have caused clashes in the south.It’s also a moment of international turmoil due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.Boric has called for greater taxes on the wealthy to help finance improved health care, education and a universal pension plan to replace a privately run system that has proven inadequate for many.He has also pushed for a higher minimum wages and the creation of more jobs for women, in particular.He also campaigned for greater environmental protections in a country famed for its enormous copper mines.Any changes may result less from Boric than from a new constitution.The assembly drafting it is due to finish this year, offering it to voters for ratication or rejection.In his speech, Mr Boric said he hopes when his term ends in four years, we “feel that it is a country that

There is no reason why major planning applications should be stuck in the system sometimes for years on end. That should be a clear red flag indicating failure.“We already know that the Northern Ireland Protocol is harming our economy. There is no rush of investment, rather a continual drain on our economy.
