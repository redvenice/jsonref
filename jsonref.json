Families split and you get on with your life.\u0027 When told that sounded cold, the actor replied \u0027Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E73ED00000578-5771503-image-a-18_1527255437250.jpg","title":"Weinstein hands NYPD biography book Broadway","story":"    Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct with a pile of books under his arm          One of the books is Elia Kazan: A Biography, about the influential film and theater director from the late forties through the sixties          The other was Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0027s Broadway Revolution          The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul seemed carefree as he was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women shortly after 7:30amKazan, who was once one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood, but also had an epic fall from grace during the witch hunt by Sen.

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

(In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/01/4CA2C1FA00000578-0-image-m-31_1527294733812.jpg","title":"Morgan Freemans creepy camera  female reporters revealed","story":"    Actor Morgan Freeman (above) is under fire after a report accusing him of misconductMorgan Freeman has spoken out again in response to allegations he sexually harassed at least eight different women to insist he is not a predator and say he is \u0027devastated\u0027 by any suggestion that he is. On Thursday, CNN published claims by eight women who alleged that Freeman had either spoken to them inappropriately, \u0027touched\u0027 them without them wanting him to or, in one of the most severe cases, lifted up their skirts. The actor issued an apology after the report emerged and said he never intended to make any of the women feel uncomfortable. But afterwards, as he was dumped by sponsors including Visa and as his legendary acting career was momentarily eclipsed by the scandal, he spoke out again. In a statement to DailyMail.com late on Friday night, the star said: \u0027I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports.Downfall of a Hollywood deity: Once revered in Tinseltown,...Visa dumps Morgan Freeman as the voice of its commercials as...Share this article\u0027All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard.

That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain’s largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.BIG SHOT OF THE WEEK: Santander\u0027s Ana Botin knows her way...Balfour Beatty is hit by row over fat cat pay after Chief...Sainsbury’s wages war on big suppliers as part of its...How on earth has BT chief earned a £1 million pay rise?...Now Netflix overtakes Disney to become the biggest media...Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Share this articleAn audit – essentially an independent check of the books and systems – is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole. It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position.All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort – and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.          Exclusive: The Number Twenty club for KPMG executivesxAnd all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.The behaviour of the Big Four auditors – Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG – has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years – from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa – has erupted with no advance warning.As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in ‘recklessness, hubris and greed’ at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scot-free and continue to enrich themselves with impunity – unless they are finally called to account.          A former chieftain at Big Four auditor Deloitte, John Connolly is just one of the multi-millionaire partners who haunt the pages of Richard Brooks’ shocking exposéAs a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC’s Luxembourg office in 2010, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret ‘advance tax agreements’ between his firm’s clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500 ‘rulings’ involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the ‘Luxleaks’ scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years. Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office. PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman’s agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax ision. The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.Tax avoidance isn’t new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry – and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.          Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GlaxoSmithKline held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way – all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.Caught offside Accountancy failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world’s top ten football officials with arrest warrants.Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags. A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant committee. No alarm was raised.But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10 million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa’s successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner’s dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a co-ordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79 million Swiss francs over five years.In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said ‘shortcomings’ had been found in KPMG’s work between 2008 and 2014 and one inidual was reprimanded.Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced £18.99.

The mistakes were obvious, we don\u0027t have to talk about that, it\u0027s all clear. he knows it, I know it, you all know it.

We did well to get the goal and get back into the game but we made mistakes and Real Madrid were really good. They\u0027re a fantastic side and will always hurt you, they deserved to win and were better on the night.\u0027The first 30 or 35 minutes, we dominated with the ball, had a couple of chances but it is frustrating. You have to give credit to them. \u0027When Mo Salah got injured they started to dominate with the ball. They scored a goal which was offside in the first half but we stayed in the game,\u0027 added Henderson.\u0027We still believed we could go on but there were a couple of goals on another night which would not have gone in.\u0027Real went ahead after the break when the ill-fated Karius threw the ball out towards forward Karim Benzema whose outstretched leg turned it into the unguarded goal.\u0027The first goal I am not sure what happened... and then the overhead kick he (Karius) could do nothing about. The third goal, the ball had loads of movement on it. It is not the mistakes Loris Karius made, we got to the final as a team and lose as a team. It is about everybody.\u0027We were not good enough on the night, and I am so proud of the players and the fans who came out for us on the night. I hope we can carry on and get into more finals and use it going forward.\u0027     Madrid substitute Gareth Bale scored a spectacular overhead kick to restore Real\u0027s lead minutes after joining the game          Bale, pictured, started the game on the bench but made an impact only minutes after taking to the field          Karius had to be consoled by Liverpool\u0027s goalkeeping coach John Achterberg and Madrid\u0027s Gareth Bale after the final whistleOn BT Sport, Steven Gerrard admitted: \u0027No it wasn\u0027t (to be). And you\u0027ve got to feel for the Liverpool players in general because the performance was good. Inidual players have played really well tonight and they\u0027ve been done by two inidual mistakes.\u0027Obviously Salah going off was pivotal because the opening stages of this game were dominated by Liverpool.\u0027Zidane again gets the big decisions right by bringing Bale on. The goal he scores is phenomenal – out of this world.\u0027But the talking points will be the keeper\u0027s mistakes.\u0027Former England captain Gary Lineker: \u0027It\u0027s hard to see how a goalkeeper can recover from something like that.\u0027          Karius, pictured, apologised to Liverpool fans who travelled to Kiev after his two errors cost the team the game          A Liverpool fan weeps by himself outside the stadium following his team\u0027s 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid this evening           Liverpool fans gathered inside Anfield but their dreams of victory were dashed by two goalkeeping howlers           This girl gathers her thoughts outside the stadium in Kiev having witnessed Liverpool\u0027s 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid While former Chelsea player Frank Lampard felt sympathy for the Liverpool keeper: \u0027On I human level… absolute sadness with him.

After his substitution, Liverpool did not have another shot at goal for the remainder of the first half which remains 0-0.           Salah was left flying and came down heavily on his shoulder which forced his replacement on with at least an hour remaining          Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp tried to console the distraught Salah as he left the field after only 30 minutes Liverpool fans outnumbered  Real Madrid\u0027s following in the 63,000-capacity crowd.Both teams\u0027 fan anthems were played before kickoff and the red scarves of Liverpool fans peppered one corner of the end occupied by Madrid supporters during \u0027You\u0027ll Never Walk Alone.\u0027The game kicked off with Liverpool fans\u0027 current Champions League song, \u0027Allez, Allez, Allez,\u0027 booming around the Olympic Stadium in Kiev. Both teams were allocated more than 16,000 tickets for the game.But Liverpool fans appeared to secure additional tickets from other sources.           Spirits appear high in Kiev\u0027s Shevchenko Park, where thousands of Liverpool fans have gathered in the sunshine ahead of the Champions League final kick-off against Real Madrid.

The mistakes were obvious, we don\u0027t have to talk about that, it\u0027s all clear. he knows it, I know it, you all know it. He has to deal with it, we have to deal with it, we will do that.\u0027          Gareth Bale\u0027s first goal which restored Real Madrid\u0027s lead was unstoppable The club\u0027s captain Jordan Henderson admitted Real Madrid deserved tonight\u0027s victory.He said: \u0027It\u0027s disappointing, of course. We did well to get the goal and get back into the game but we made mistakes and Real Madrid were really good. They\u0027re a fantastic side and will always hurt you, they deserved to win and were better on the night.\u0027The first 30 or 35 minutes, we dominated with the ball, had a couple of chances but it is frustrating. You have to give credit to them. \u0027When Mo Salah got injured they started to dominate with the ball. They scored a goal which was offside in the first half but we stayed in the game,\u0027 added Henderson.\u0027We still believed we could go on but there were a couple of goals on another night which would not have gone in.\u0027Real went ahead after the break when the ill-fated Karius threw the ball out towards forward Karim Benzema whose outstretched leg turned it into the unguarded goal.\u0027The first goal I am not sure what happened... and then the overhead kick he (Karius) could do nothing about. The third goal, the ball had loads of movement on it. It is not the mistakes Loris Karius made, we got to the final as a team and lose as a team. It is about everybody.\u0027We were not good enough on the night, and I am so proud of the players and the fans who came out for us on the night.

After his substitution, Liverpool did not have another shot at goal for the remainder of the first half which remains 0-0.           Salah was left flying and came down heavily on his shoulder which forced his replacement on with at least an hour remaining          Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp tried to console the distraught Salah as he left the field after only 30 minutes Liverpool fans outnumbered  Real Madrid\u0027s following in the 63,000-capacity crowd.Both teams\u0027 fan anthems were played before kickoff and the red scarves of Liverpool fans peppered one corner of the end occupied by Madrid supporters during \u0027You\u0027ll Never Walk Alone.\u0027The game kicked off with Liverpool fans\u0027 current Champions League song, \u0027Allez, Allez, Allez,\u0027 booming around the Olympic Stadium in Kiev. Both teams were allocated more than 16,000 tickets for the game.But Liverpool fans appeared to secure additional tickets from other sources.           Spirits appear high in Kiev\u0027s Shevchenko Park, where thousands of Liverpool fans have gathered in the sunshine ahead of the Champions League final kick-off against Real Madrid.

UK car production rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 1970s and today provides more than 800,000 jobs in Britain.Why, then, am I filled with a sense of foreboding? Quite simply because I fear hardline Brexiteers are in danger of achieving what that rabble of militant trade unions failed to do: destroying the British car industry.In fact, I am even more worried than I was back then, when at least I could help fix the part of the industry I ran myself. Today, our fate lies in the hands of politicians whose negotiations threaten not just our own business but the whole British economy.Revealed: How letting an ambulance past can land motorists...Gardeners\u0027 World guest is accused of racism for calling the...Share this articleThat’s not just my view. I can assure you that the leaders of all the other big automotive firms agree that we are in real danger of damaging an industry we have spent decades rebuilding.At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril.Why? Allow me to explain. One of the biggest reasons the automotive industry failed in the 1970s is that supply chains were seriously disrupted and completely unpredictable, so costs soared and quality deteriorated.Modern supply chains need to be super-efficient. The car industry has been described as the most complex organisation of human endeavour on the planet, which is not surprising when you consider that there are more than 20 million variations of, for example, a Range Rover. Precisely the correct part must be available at the right time when the car moves down the production line.          At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril (file image)For example a red, right- hand, heated, electronic wing mirror must arrive for car number one and then, for car number two, a blue one with a different specification.These components come from all over the world, with the vast majority being sourced outside Europe. Car supply chains are particularly at risk of delay because 60 per cent of parts are imported. That equates to more than a thousand delivery lorries from the Continent to the UK every day.Take fuel tanks, for instance. People don’t stop to think about them, but of course you can’t get a car off a production line without one. Half of all the cars made in Britain rely on fuel tanks that come from Unipart’s factories in this country.It takes a long, long time to design and develop each tank. They are sophisticated and complex products with multiple components coming from continental Europe. All that could be thrown into expensive disarray if just one component is not there when we need it.The idea that we could start sourcing all the components for the fuel tanks in the UK just doesn’t work. We would love to, but it isn’t possible – if it were, we would already be doing it.The issue here is not one of border tariffs. The hard Brexiteers say that since German manufacturers want to sell their cars to us in the UK, there is no incentive for them to try to impose heavy tariffs after Brexit. Perhaps so. But that’s not the real problem.Tariffs hurt competitiveness and we don’t like that, but at least we can plan for them because they are quantifiable and predictable. Delays at border checkpoints, however, are disastrous precisely because they are so unpredictable.If we don’t know where a part is because it is stuck on a lorry in Europe and can’t get across the border, or they haven’t trained enough customs officials yet, then we have no certainty when it will arrive. The industry operates efficient ‘just-in-time’ practices so stock is not left lying around. That means we would normally have only enough parts at customers’ factories to keep the production lines running for just eight hours.But if the right part isn’t there when it is needed, you either have to send the car on and rework it afterwards, which is expensive and hurts quality, or you have to stop the production line. And that is very expensive, costing more than £1 million an hour – all for the sake of that single missing component.If we barrel headlong towards a hard Brexit, I fear such border delays are not only possible but inevitable, with the result that I believe the British motor industry will find it very difficult to survive in the long term.The hard Brexiteers prefer to avoid discussion of such practicalities, with talk of the UK forging new trade deals outside the EU. But again, it is more complex than that.For instance, a free-trade agreement with South Korea currently requires that cars we manufacture in the UK for export to Korea have 55 per cent of ‘local content’.Under the current rules, British-based car firms are allowed to count all EU components as being of local origin, even though only 25 per cent of them are typically sourced here. With a hard Brexit, I am not sure we can do that any longer, so the deal simply doesn’t work.Now do you understand why automotive bosses like me are so worried?But this is not just about the survival of firms such as mine, it is about the pounds in your pocket. The car industry benefits the UK economy to the tune of £200 billion a year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.Many people don’t realise that if the car industry fails, the economy will go with it. No one voted in the referendum to lose their jobs or their income.So what, then, can be done to avoid looming disaster. At the minimum, we must stay in the customs union. If the hard Brexiteers can find a credible and executable alternative, which deliver the same results, we need to see the evidence. There has been none so far.To press ahead without such a frictionless trade deal in place would be an act of wanton self-destruction.How tragic it would be if we had saved the British car industry from the grip of one damaging political ideology in the militant 1970s, only to lose it to another in 2018. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/14/4984EB0700000578-0-image-m-67_1519396707285.jpg","title":"Terrifying moment military jet flies just 90ft paraglider","story":"    The Royal Navy Hawk T1 flew between the four paragliders while on a practice bombing run at an adjacent military rangeThen as the Hawk soared above him and below his colleagues, he says nervously: ‘Like a wild man.

Among the five judges of the Golden Booker are the poet Lemn Sissay, who chose from the winners of the 1980s, and the writer Robert McCrum, the Observer’s former literary editor, who tackled the 1970s.“The golden Booker is a stunt, of course, but a surprisingly worthwhile one,” said McCrum. “It’s a vindication of 50 years’ debate about the nature of so-called literary fiction. Prizes offer an odd kind of lit crit, but I’d say that almost all the novels the judges had to read, reread and consider have stood the test of time.”Sissay’s choice of Lively’s book, a story of loss and desire set around the time of the second world war, is perhaps the biggest surprise. He rejected some very famous titles indeed, including Anita Brookner’s Hotel du Lac, Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils, Peter Carey’s Oscar and Lucinda, William Golding’s Rites of Passage and Thomas Keneally’s Schindler’s Ark. Salman Rushdie, who won the Booker prize with Midnight’s Children in 1981 and who is attending the Hay festival this year, also did not make the grade. Neither did Kazuo Ishiguro, the winner of the Nobel prize for literature last year and a Booker winner in 1989 for The Remains of the Day.The other three judges are Kamila Shamsie, whose new novel Home Fire is in the running for the women’s prize for fiction, the former Orange prize, and who assessed winners from the 1990s the broadcaster and novelist Simon Mayo, who picked the first of Mantel’s historical trilogy from the 2000s and the poet Hollie McNish, who selected last year’s Booker winner, Saunders’s melancholy story about Abraham Lincoln, from the current decade.The five judges were asked to read, or reread, each winner from their given decade before selecting what Man Booker is calling the golden five. All 51 winners since the prize was first awarded in 1969 are still in print – a vindication of the judges’ choices which can often prove controversial.McCrum said he was “quite passionate” about his choice of Naipaul’s novel, although he doubted it would do as well as Mantel or Ondaatje’s books in the popular voting stage. He picked In A Free State over three enduring titles by female authors: Nadine Gordimer’s The Conservationist, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s Heat and Dust and Iris Murdoch’s The Sea, The Sea.“If our shortlist of five were placed in a time capsule for re-examination in 2118, it would provide a surprisingly reliable snapshot of the novel in English, 1970-2010,” said McCrum.The five shortlisted books will now be put to a month-long public vote on the Man Booker prize website and the ultimate winner will be announced at the Man Booker 50 festival at the Southbank Centre in London on 8\u0026nbspJuly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d43aec894b3da83d9a1f6507206ee5f6914383/0_139_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77bb6aa3df238133a38cbf01569515f3","title":"the observer view on the irish referendum result","story":"The majority in favour of repealing the eighth amendment reveals how far attitudes have changed – and the waning influence of the churchFor decades, Irish women with an unviable or unwanted pregnancy have faced an impossible choice. A choice between a lonely – and for many, prohibitively expensive – journey to a foreign country to seek a safe abortion an attempt to do it themselves, risking death or criminal prosecution or simply succumbing to a state that forces them to carry their pregnancy to term, regardless of whether they conceived through rape, or fatal foetal abnormalities mean their baby will die at birth.No more. Friday’s referendum – expected to be close – in the end delivered a decisive majority in favour of repealing the Irish constitution’s eighth amendment, which since 1983 has recognised an equal right to life for both mothers and their unborn children, effectively prohibiting abortion in almost all cases.The amendment has wreaked pain on countless Irish lives. The tragic, avoidable death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 became the rallying cry for reform: denied an abortion when she began to miscarry, she died of sepsis in hospital a week later. Over the years there have been many more cases that illustrate the costs of religious fundamentalism trumping compassion and common sense, such as the case of a suicidal 14-year-old girl who became pregnant as a result of rape, and whom the Irish courts tried to prevent accessing an abortion abroad.The result, described by Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, as “the culmination of a quiet revolution in Ireland”, is extraordinary on two counts. First, in its decisiveness: watching thousands of young people flock home to vote by boat, train and plane, many thought this vote would be a tale of two Irelands – older and younger rural and urban the past and the future.That the resounding victory was not purely a result of generational displacement hints at an Ireland more unified than many believed. Exit polls suggest that even among the over-65s, a very significant minority voted for repeal. Alongside Ireland’s popular vote for equal marriage, it reveals just how much social attitudes have transformed as a result of people with longstanding views changing their minds.The result was also extraordinary for what it represents: not just an embrace of women’s reproductive rights, but a sweeping away of one of the last vestiges of church influence on the state. Decades of scandal – from the Catholic church’s role in running the Magdalene laundries where thousands of unwed, pregnant women were imprisoned and abused, to the child sex abuse scandals that have racked it – have eroded its moral legitimacy and left it vulnerable to charges of the most extreme hypocrisy. An institution that looked the other way when women in its protection were raped, and children in its care were sexually abused, cannot expect to command the moral obedience of a nation.The Irish parliament is now set to legalise abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, bringing Ireland into line with most of Europe, with abortion available up to 24 weeks on much more restricted grounds.This will profoundly improve the lives of Irish women. But the result will also be felt beyond Ireland’s borders: most strongly and immediately in Northern Ireland, where the only way women can secure safe and legal abortion is to travel to the British mainland. The MP Stella Creasy is planning to force a parliamentary vote on the issue, but liberalisation is strongly opposed by the anti-abortion DUP, on whose votes the government relies at Westminster. The DUP cannot claim to speak for Northern Ireland, where there is a clear majority in favour of liberalisation. It would be unforgivable for Theresa May to trade away the rights of British women in exchange for the DUP’s parliamentary support.The fact that we will see a more liberal approach to abortion in Dublin than in Liverpool, at least in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, should also give pause for thought. Britain’s antiquated abortion law – under which abortion remains a criminal offence and a woman is permitted an abortion only if two doctors confirm that continuing with the pregnancy poses a serious risk to her physical or mental health – is demeaning and paternalistic.Saturday’s result also offers hope to the 1.25 billion women globally who have no access to safe abortion. It will offer succour to those women’s rights campaigners in countries such as the US and Poland battling against restrictions in abortion rights being pushed by religious conservatives. And it will offer hope to those working to achieve social change across the globe. Like the campaign for equal marriage, the Irish campaign for repeal shows that over the years it is possible to change people’s minds, to build a coalition, to use arguments framed in compassion and pragmatism to bring along those who lean towards social conservatism.And so the reverberations of what is first and foremost an Irish victory for women’s reproductive rights will be felt across the world. The long arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but only if some of us take responsibility for guiding it there. Like the great civil rights movements that precede it, the Irish campaign for the repeal of the eighth stands as a potent and contemporary reminder that it can be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4979022a17c008fdd63fca46e56bc3cacf8ef8d4/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0eea361f3df9ebd3235f7831908d711","title":"brexit six tests eu starmer corbyn","story":"Labour’s spokesman is taking us for fools. A party that stands up for working people cannot allow them to be hit hardest of allIt cannot be easy being Keir Starmer. A cerebral, rational lawyer with a forensic mind who entered politics just as populism was infecting it badly. A man used to executive authority, built more for government than opposition. With a place at the top table as shadow Brexit secretary but viewed on that issue, and much else, with considerable suspicion by true Corbynista believers in the leader’s inner circle. Having to forge a position that straddles the historic Euroscepticism of Jeremy Corbyn and the posh boy revolutionaries who surround him, the overwhelming pro-Europeanism of Labour members whom the leadership says it listens to, and the “will of the people” as expressed on one day in June 2016.It was these competing pressures that led Starmer and Corbyn to arrive at a position defined as “constructive ambiguity”. In Theresa May’s disastrous election campaign, the ambiguity seemed to work well. Leavers sensed Corbyn was basically on their side. Remainers saw Labour as the only credible route to blunt May’s push for hard Brexit. The party was able to shift the focus to other issues, and allow the elephant in the room to fade into the background.Constructive ambiguity was a phrase Tony Blair often used to describe our approach to negotiating peace in Northern Ireland. But there came a point, as he put it, when that strategy had to be replaced by “acts of completion”. Similarly, the latter-day version of constructive ambiguity has run its course and must be replaced by acts of decision.Just as the government is finally having to confront some difficult choices, so is Labour. And facing both ways will hold neither electoral appeal nor intellectual credibility, not least because Starmer set six tests against which he said May’s Brexit deal would be judged, and it is becoming ever clearer than none of them are being met.Does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? It will certainly be weaker and less collaborative than now.Does it deliver the “exact same benefits” as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union? No, and none of the deals on offer will do so.Does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities? Highly unlikely and, looking at the Windrush scandal, would we trust May to deal with the rights of EU migrants in Britain and UK migrants in Europe?Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom? A race to the bottom is precisely what many Brexiteers want.Does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime? Not according to anyone I know who is working in that field.Does it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK? No, and the government impact assessment papers make that perfectly clear.Even at this stage, it is impossible to imagine the deal that could be secured from the current “screwed-up … botched … delusional … shambles” – as the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings calls the negotiations – that would not be opposed by a “jobs first” Labour frontbench.As a hardcore remainer, who believes that if you believe something will damage the country you should seek to prevent it, I welcomed the Starmer tests precisely because I could see no way they would be met, and therefore no way Labour could support the Brexit put before parliament. Add a reasonably sized Tory rebellion to a Labour whip against a deal that failed to pass the tests, then the government is defeated, a crisis ensues and, who knows, it may suit May, and parliament, to put the deal to a people’s vote.However, though there seems to me to be a compelling logic that moves from failure to meet the tests to a three-line whip against the deal, it does not appear to be shared by the normally hyper-logical lawyer. Indeed, you will have to look long and hard to find him on the record as saying Labour will vote against a deal that fails to meet those tests. Refusing to support is not the same as opposing. And at last week’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, when Starmer projected himself as the driver of step-by-step shifts in Labour’s position, MPs such as Mary Creagh pointed out that it had taken persistent and steady rebellion to get the leadership to move at all.Though the MP Owen Smith was sacked for daring to voice opposition to one part of Labour’s Brexit strategy, Barry Gardiner survived, and continues to be one of the few Labour faces allowed on TV, despite dismissing the Starmer tests – surely the key plank of the strategy – as “bollocks”.But now Starmer himself has given the impression that Labour has no intention of using any vote in parliament this year to block a Brexit deal, even if it obviously fails his tests.“In my heart of hearts,” he told the Fabian Society, “I don’t think we’re going to know what “out” looks like until the end of the transition period. I really don’t. I wish I thought otherwise, but I don’t. I think that out will only come into full shape probably at the earliest 2021.”I always feared the transition was a trap and this suggests Labour intends fully to fall into it. This must be music to the ears of Brextremists who just want to get to March 2019, because they know that once the flag comes down there is no chance of it going back up again for a generation or more, whatever the mess that ensues.To compound the fault, Starmer spoke in the context of seeking to discourage supporters of a people’s vote on the final deal. So, if Labour will not vote against the deal in parliament, even if the tests are failed, and he won’t support a people’s vote on the deal, it puts Labour in much the same position as the government and the Brextremists within it. Whatever the costs, whatever the consequences, we are out. And the fine talk that “we would negotiate a better deal” will have to change tense subtly, and irrelevantly, to “we would have negotiated a better deal”.It leaves me with the uneasy feeling that Starmer is taking us for fools. He risks enabling Brexit without the people being given a final say on the deal on the utterly spurious grounds that no one will know the full consequences of leaving Europe until after we’ve left. A lawyer as good as Keir should be embarrassed to make such an argument. A Labour party that was founded to stand up for working people should be ashamed if it helps facilitate a hard Brexit that will hit those people hardest of all.Labour members deserve better than this. We deserve a party leadership that is willing to fight the Tories on their disastrous approach to Brexit and which does so in words of clarity and directness, full on.Jeremy Corbyn still has enough credibility and celebrity to get a great reception when speaking to students in Northern Ireland. But there is every danger of a hard border, which he insists will never be, materialising with the hard Brexit he is failing properly to oppose.The government is wide open to be torn apart on Brexit, which is shaping up to be biggest con job since the South Sea Bubble. A government that insists on pressing on with such a shoddy scheme will never be forgiven. But nor will an opposition that lets them get away with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eaeec3bf99d7b3b66141bf3c6b8da04a3f87147/12_0_3874_2324/master/3874.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9538165bc9c4e3491e1309d6768600e","title":"world distraction demands new focus","story":"Imagine that you’ve just bought a new GPS device for your car. The first time you use it, it works as expected. However, on the second journey, it takes you to an address a few blocks away from where you had wanted to go. On the third trip, you’re shocked when you find yourself miles away from your intended destination, which is now on the opposite side of town. Frustrated, you decide to return home, but when you enter your address, the GPS gives you a route that would have you driving for hours and ending up in a totally different city.Like any reasonable person, you would consider this GPS faulty and return it to the store – if not throw it out of your car window. Who would continue to put up with a GPS that they knew would take them somewhere other than where they wanted to go? What reason could\u0026nbspanyone possibly have for continuing to tolerate such a thing?No one would put up with this sort of distraction from a technology that directs them through physical space. Yet we do precisely this, on a daily basis, when it comes to the technologies that direct us through informational space. We have a curiously high tolerance for poor navigability when it comes to our attentional GPSs – those technologies that direct our thoughts, our actions and our lives.Think for a moment about the goals you have set for yourself: your goals for reading this essay, for later today, for this week, even later this year and beyond. If you’re like most people, they’re probably goals such as “learn how to play piano”, “spend more time with family”, “plan that trip I’ve been meaning to take” and so on.These are real goals, human goals. They’re the kinds of goals that, when we’re on our deathbeds, we’ll regret not having accomplished. If technology is for anything, it’s for helping us pursue these kinds of goals.A few years ago, I read an article called Regrets of the Dying. It was about a businesswoman named Bronnie Ware whose disillusionment with the daily slog of her trade had led her to leave it and to start working in a different place: in rooms where people were facing their final hours. She spent her days attending to their needs and listening to their regrets and she recorded the most common things they wished they’d done, or hadn’t done, in life: they’d worked too hard, they hadn’t told people how they felt, they hadn’t let themselves be happy and so on. This, it seems to me, is the proper perspective – the one that’s truly our own. It’s the perspective that our screens and machines ought to help us circle back on again and again: because whatever we might choose to want, nobody chooses to want to regret.Think back on your goals from a moment ago. Now try to imagine what your technologies’ goals are for you. What do you think they are? I don’t mean the companies’ mission statements and high-flying marketing messages – I mean the goals on the dashboards in their product design meetings, the metrics they’re using to direct your attention, to define what success means for your life. How likely is it that they reflect the goals you have for yourself?Not very likely, I’m sorry to say. From their perspective, success is almost always defined in the form of low-level “engagement” goals, as they’re often called. These include things like maximising the amount of time you spend with their product, keeping you clicking or tapping or scrolling as much as possible, or showing you as many pages or ads as they can. But these “engagement” goals are petty, subhuman goals. No person has these goals for themselves. No one wakes up in the morning and asks: “How much time can I possibly spend using social media today?” (If there is someone like that, I’d love to meet them and understand their mind.)What this means, though, is that there’s a deep misalignment between the goals we set for ourselves and the goals that many of our information technologies have for us. This seems to me to be a really big deal and one that no one talks about nearly enough. We trust these technologies to be companion systems for our lives: we trust them to help us do the things we want to do, to become the people we want to be. We trust them to be on our side.Yet these wondrous machines, for all their potential, have not been on our side. Our goals have not been their goals. Rather than supporting our intentions, they have largely sought to grab and keep our attention. In their cut-throat rivalry for the increasingly scarce prize of “persuading” us, of shaping our thoughts and actions in accordance with their predefined goals, they have been forced to resort to the cheapest, pettiest tricks in the book, appealing to the lowest parts of us, to the lesser selves that our higher natures perennially struggle to overcome. Furthermore, they now deploy in the service of this attentional capture and exploitation the most intelligent systems of computation the world has seen.If you wanted to train all of society to be as impulsive and weak-willed as possible, how would you do it? One way would be to invent an impulsivity training device – let’s call it an iTrainer – that delivers an endless supply of informational rewards on demand. You’d want to make it small enough to fit in a pocket or purse so people could carry it anywhere they went. The informational rewards it would pipe into their attentional world could be anything, from cute cat photos to tidbits of news that outrage you (because outrage can, after all, be a reward too). To boost its effectiveness, you could endow the iTrainer with rich systems of intelligence and automation so it could adapt to users’ behaviours, contexts and inidual quirks in order to get them to spend as much time and attention with it as possible.So let’s say you build the iTrainer and distribute it gradually into society. At first, people’s willpower would probably be pretty strong and resistant. The iTrainer might also cause awkward social situations, at least until enough people had adopted it so that it was widely accepted. But if everyone were to keep using it over several years, you’d probably start seeing it work pretty well. Now, the iTrainer might make people’s lives harder to live: it would no doubt get in the way of the effective pursuit of their desired tasks and goals. Even though you created it, you probably wouldn’t let your kids use one. But from the point of view of your design goals, ie making the world more impulsive and weak-willed, it would probably be a roaring success.Then what if you wanted to take things even further? What if you wanted to make everyone even more distracted, angry, cynical – and even unsure of what, or how, to think? What if you wanted to troll everyone’s minds? You’d probably create an engine, a set of economic incentives, which would make it profitable for other people to produce and deliver these rewards – and, where possible, you’d make these the only incentives for doing so. You don’t want just any rewards to get delivered – you want people to receive rewards that speak to their impulsive selves, rewards that are the best at punching the right buttons in their brains. For good measure, you could also centralise the ownership of this design as much as possible.If you’d done all this 10 years ago, right about now you’d probably be seeing some interesting results. You’d probably see nine out of 10 people never leaving home without their iTrainer. 1) Almost half its users would say they couldn’t even live without their device. 2) You’d probably see them using it to access most of the information they consume, across every context of life: from politics to education to celebrity gossip and beyond. You’d probably find they were using the iTrainer hundreds of times per day, spending a third of their waking lives engaged with it and it would probably be the first and last thing they engaged with every day.If you wanted to train society to be as weak-willed and impulsive as possible, you could do a whole lot worse than this. In any event, after unleashing the iTrainer into the world, it would be absurd to claim that it hadn’t produced significant changes in the thoughts, behaviour and habits of its users. After all, everyone would have been part of a rigorous impulsivity training programme for many years.What’s more, this programme would have effectively done an end-run around many of our other societal systems: it would have opened a door directly on to our attentional capacities and become a primary lens through which we see the world. It would, of course, be a major undertaking to try to understand the full story of the effects this project had had on people’s lives – not only as iniduals, but also for society as a whole. It would certainly have had major implications for the way we had been collectively discussing and deciding questions of great importance. And it would certainly have given us, as did previous forms of media, political candidates who were made in its image.Of course, the iTrainer project would never come anywhere close to passing a research ethics review. Launching such a project of societal reshaping, and letting it run unchecked, would clearly be utterly outrageous. So it’s a good thing this is all just a thought experiment.The Canadian media theorist Harold Innis once said that his entire career’s work proceeded from the question: “Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?” When I was working in the technology industry, I realised that I’d been woefully negligent in asking this question about my own attention. When I started doing so, I began to see with new eyes the dashboards, metrics and goals that were driving much of its design. These were the destinations we were entering into the GPSs guiding the lives of millions of human beings. I soon came to understand that the technology industry wasn’t designing products it was designing users. These magical, general-purpose systems weren’t neutral “tools” they were purpose-driven navigation systems guiding flesh-and-blood human lives. They were extensions of our attention.The new challenges we face in the Age of Attention are, on both inidual and collective levels, challenges of self-regulation. Having some limits is inevitable in human life. In fact, limits are necessary if we are to have any freedom at all. Like the iTrainer in my thought experiment, digital technologies have transformed our experiential world into a never-ending flow of potential informational rewards. They’ve become the playing field on which everything now competes for our attention. Similar to economic abundance, “if these rewards arrive faster than the disciplines of prudence can form, then self-control will decline with affluence: the affluent (with everyone else) will become less prudent” (as Avner Offer writes in The Challenge of Affluence).In a sense, information abundance requires us to invert our understanding of what “information technologies” do: rather than overcoming barriers in the world, they increasingly exist to help us put barriers in place. The headphone manufacturer Bose now sells a product called Hearphones that allows the user to block out all sounds in their environment except the ones coming from their desired source – to focus on a conversation in a loud room, for example. The product’s website reads: “Focus on the voices you want to hear – and filter out the noises you don’t – so you can comfortably hear every word. From now on, how you hear is up to you.” We could also read this tagline as a fitting description of the new challenges in the Age of Attention as a whole.The increasing rate of technological change further amplifies these challenges of attention and self-regulation. Historically, new forms of media took years, if not generations, to be adopted, analysed and adapted to. Today, however, new technologies can arrive on the scene and rapidly scale to millions of users in the course of months or even days.The constant stream of new products this unleashes – along with the ongoing optimisation of features within products already in use – can result in a situation in which users are in a constant state of learning and adaptation to new interaction dynamics, familiar enough with their technologies to operate them, but never so fully in control that they can prevent the technologies from operating on them in unexpected or undesirable ways. This keeps us living on what I sometimes call a “treadmill of incompetence”.What do you pay when you pay attention? You pay with all the things you could have attended to, but didn’t: all the goals you didn’t pursue, all the actions you didn’t take and all the possible yous you could have been, had you attended to those other things. Attention is paid in possible futures foregone. You pay for that extra Game of Thrones episode with the heart-to-heart talk you could have had with your anxious child. You pay for that extra hour on social media with the sleep you didn’t get and the fresh feeling you didn’t have the next morning. You pay for giving in to that outrage-inducing piece of clickbait about that politician you hate with the patience and empathy it took from you and your anger at yourself for allowing yourself to take the bait in the first place.We pay attention with the lives we might have lived. When we consider the opportunity costs in this wider view, the question of “attention” extends far beyond the next turn in your life’s GPS: it encompasses all the turns and their relations, the nature of your destination, the specific way you want to get there, why you’re going there and also your ability to ask any of these questions in the first place. In this view, the question of attention becomes the question of having the freedom to navigate your life in the way you want, across all scales of the human experience.But I also knew this wasn’t just about me – my freedom, my attention, my deep distractions, my frustrated goals. Because when most people in society use your product, you aren’t just designing users – you’re designing society. But if all of society were to become as distracted in this new, deep way as I was starting to feel, what would that mean? What would be the implications for our shared interests, our common purposes, our collective identities, our politics?Some threats to freedom we recognise immediately others take time to reveal themselves for what they are. For too long, we’ve minimised the personal and political threats of this intelligent, adversarial persuasion as mere “distraction” or minor annoyance. In the short term, these challenges can indeed frustrate our ability to do the things we want to do. In the longer term, however, they can make it harder for us to live the lives we want to live or, even worse, undermine fundamental capacities such as reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of philosopher Harry Frankfurt, to “want what we want to want”. Seen in this light, these new attentional adversaries threaten not only the success, but even the integrity of the human will, at both inidual and collective levels.I used to think there were no great political struggles left. The truly epic defences of freedom, I thought, had been fought and won by generations greater than my own, leaving to my time only the task of dutifully administering our hard-earned political inheritance. I was ready to live in a world where my own great struggles would take place primarily in the memories, the simulations of the old ones. I was prepared to find new ways of satisfying the need for struggle in the face of a world that no longer demanded it. I used to think the big political questions had more or less been answered.How wrong I was. I now believe the liberation of human attention may be the defining moral and political struggle of our time. It is a first-order problem its success is a prerequisite to the success of virtually all other struggles. We therefore have an obligation to rewire the system of intelligent, adversarial persuasion we have inherited before it rewires us.Doing so requires hacking together new ways of talking and thinking about the problem, as well as summoning the courage necessary for advancing on it in inconvenient and unpopular ways. I know that this courage exists – the open question is whether, in this world of torrential distraction, it can still receive a proper hearing.• James Williams is the author of Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy (CUP)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233f1ec684e15247b26a82bcf183d0443069fa60/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188d236bbeb75e48c918d5a2562747a1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Wild horses, an Ethiopian wolf and a dolphin attacking a porpoise are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a40c9414521a97a107a31c4510ae568b3a14e743/6_1216_3728_2235/master/3728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a87bf6818fffef1eae0bf365cb743e2","title":"anthony hopkins most nonsense most lie lear","story":"Alcoholism and ambition fuelled the actor’s rise to the top.

You can feel a quicksilver energy about him, a restlessness. Every so often, I think he’s going to stop the interview and take flight, but actually he’s enjoying himself and keeps saying, “Ask me more! This is great!”We meet in Rome, where he is making a Netflix film about the relationship between the last pope (Benedict) and the current one (Francis). Hopkins is playing Benedict, Jonathan Pryce is Francis. He is enjoying this – “We’re filming in the Sistine Chapel tomorrow!” – and we are both relishing the lovely view across the city from the penthouse suite in the hotel where he’s staying. Still, he declares that the film we are here to talk about, the BBC’s King Lear, filmed in England and directed by Richard Eyre, is the piece of work that has made him truly happy. “I felt, ‘Yes, I can do this.’ I can do this sort of work. I didn’t walk away. And it’s so invigorating, because I know I can do it, and I’ve got my sense of humour, my humility, and nothing’s been destroyed.”He’s played the part before, at the National Theatre in 1986, with David Hare directing. “I was… ” – he counts in his head “… 48,” he says. “Ridiculous. I didn’t realise I was too young. I had no concept of how to do it. I was floundering.”Now, he feels he’s got Lear right, and few would disagree. In a star-studded cast – Emma Thompson plays Goneril Emily Watson, Regan Jim Broadbent, Gloucester Jim Carter, Kent Andrew Scott, Edgar – it’s Hopkins who dominates. He is fantastic: his white hair close-cropped, his manner like a heavy-headed bull, a scary tyrant losing his powers, a drinker who flips into terrifying rage.Hopkins’ theory is that Lear’s wife died giving birth to Cordelia, and Lear brought her up, his favourite, as a tomboy. Of the older two daughters, Emily Watson said, “and I agree with her, that they have become monsters, because he made them so”. Hopkins believes that Lear is terrified of women, can’t understand them. Hence the awful specificity of the curses he rains on his older daughters, damning their wombs. He seeks refuge in men, surrounding himself with a boisterous male army. The scenes where Lear wants to bring his retinue to Regan’s house are reminiscent of an awful, all-boys-together drink-fest.“I come from a generation where men were men,” Hopkins says. “There’s nothing soft or touchy-feely about any of us, where we were from in Wales. There’s a negative side to that, because we’re not very good at receiving love or giving it. We don’t understand it. After Richard Burton died, his brother Graham invited me to the Dorchester where they were all having a get-together, the wives and the men, all the sisters and brothers. All pissed. And I noticed the women were sipping their ports and brandy, but all the men were, ‘Come on, drink! Drink!’ I thought, ‘There’s something very Greek about this.’ Men together. You know, like the bouzouki dancers. It’s not homosexuality, but it is a sexuality, a kind of bonding. That’s what I was thinking of.”Hopkins often uses his past to find his way into a character. Small incidents that stick in his mind, real people who inform. In the scene with Kent, Edgar and the Fool, as Lear descends into madness, he has all three line up on a bench and addresses them with the wrong names. Hopkins decided that Lear had seen his father drown three puppies when he was young and believed his friends to be those dogs. “Cruelty to an animal stays with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “I once witnessed something like that, but I can’t think of it too much, it’s too upsetting. But that little kernel of an event doesn’t go. It grows with you.” When he portrays deliberately scary people – such as Hannibal Lecter or Robert Ford in the Westworld series – he plays them quietly, emphasising their sinister control. His Lear, though, is explosive. “He’s completely bonkers – he laughs at the storm. That’s what I like about him.”In the film, Hopkins uses a horseshoe as his crown. He asked a friend, Drew Dalton, a props guy on Westworld who is also an Idaho farmer, to get it for him, and he told him it was from an old horse, born in 1925. When Hopkins talks about this horse, he gets a little teary. “I carry the horseshoe with me wherever I go now. I still get emotional about it – the power, and the loneliness, and the pain of that horse. That’s Lear.”Tears come easily to him, especially when he talks about hard work, old age, masculinity. His father, Dick, was a baker, a tough, practical man, born of another baker. But, Hopkins says, as he got older, small things would upset him, “like if he made a mistake in his car and drove off a ramp instead of getting it just right, he’d break down crying. Towards the end of his life, he used to drink, and he was unpredictable. Never violent, but sudden turns of rage, and then deep depressions. Turned on my mother, turned on me. I was old enough, so it didn’t bother me. We didn’t speak much before he died. He resented me for something. I understood it, I could get it, and I thought, ‘What a terrible, lonely horror, for people at the end of their lives.’”It’s easy to see how he drew on this for Lear. Hopkins has a daughter, too, Abigail, from his first marriage, but they don’t have a relationship, so there was no inspiration there. “No. I accepted it years ago. It’s her choice and she must live her life. I say to young people, ‘If your parents are giving you trouble, move out.’ You’ve got to let go. You don’t have to kill your parents, but just leave if it’s holding you back.”Lear came out of another BBC film, an adaptation of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, also directed by Eyre and broadcast in 2015. Hopkins was the ageing, belligerent actor Sir, who is preparing to play Lear Ian McKellen was Norman, his dresser. Hopkins had wanted to do the play since picking up a copy in a bookshop in Los Angeles, where he lives: “It opened the valves of nostalgia.”When he first became involved in the theatre, in the late 1950s, Hopkins was a stage manager, touring northern towns, meeting “old, wrecked, alcoholic, wonderful” vaudeville comedians who’d worked during the war, talking to stage hands who knew the technique of dropping the curtain for comedy (fast) and tragedy (very slow). Then he joined the National in the time of Olivier and Gielgud. He was impatient for success. “Oh,” he says, “I had nonspeaking parts, messengers and God knows what, and I was very disgruntled, because I wanted to be bigger. So I went to the casting director and said, ‘Who do you have to sleep with to get a part around here?’ I’d only been there three weeks!”The casting director was taken aback, but mentioned him to Olivier, who gave him a part as an IRA man in Juno And The Paycock. Hopkins knows now that his hubris was ludicrous, but he was anxious to get to the action, and still is. “I think, with life, just get on with it, you know?” he says. “We’re all going to die, and that’s a great motivator.”He’s always called himself a loner – “alone, loner, solitary”, he says to me – and in past interviews his outsiderdom has become almost his headline characteristic. But he and McKellen bonded, regaling each other with old stories instead of rehearsing. Having felt, for all those years, unwanted by the establishment, the establishment was making him welcome. He also realised that he wanted to do Lear for real.Not on stage, though. Despite his nostalgia, Hopkins hates the theatre. In 1973, he walked out of Macbeth mid-run at the National and moved to LA. The last stage play he was in was M Butterfly, in the West End in 1989. It was a torment, he says, the tipping point being a matinee where nobody laughed, “not a titter”. When the lights came up, the cast realised the entire audience was Japanese. “Oh God,” he recalls. “You’d go to your dressing room and someone would pop their head round the door and say, ‘Coffee? Tea?’ And I’d think, ‘An open razor, please.’”He can’t stand being unproductive, working without a point it drives him mad. David Hare once told Hopkins he’d never met anyone as angry: “And this was when I was off the booze!” He gave up drinking in 1975. For a while, he tried to quieten down his personality (“I was ever so careful”), but his mother told him it wasn’t working. “She said, ‘Why don’t you just be the bastard that you really are?’ She said, ‘I know what you’re like, you’re a monster.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘Well, OK then, be a monster.’“But the anger, you begin to channel it,” he says. “I’m very happy I’m an alcoholic – it’s a great gift, because wherever I go, the abyss follows me. It’s a volcanic anger you have, and it’s fuel. Rocket fuel. But of course it can rip you to pieces and kill you. So, gradually, over the years, I have learned not to be a people-pleaser. I don’t have a temper any more. I get impatient, but I try not to judge. I try to live and let live. I don’t get into arguments, I don’t offer opinions, and I think if you do that, then the anger finally begins to transform into drive.”Now, if he’s not acting, he paints, or plays the piano. He released an album of classical compositions, Composer, performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2011, which was well-received. “Hopkins writes with considerable flair and confidence,” said one critic, while Amazon gives it four stars. He began painting at the behest of Stella, who saw how he decorates his scripts. He goes over his lines around 250 times, until he can recite them backwards, sideways, in his sleep. Every time he reads them, he draws a doodle on his script, and the doodles, which start as small crosses, grow enormously large, covering all the blank space. Stella saw this and got him to paint “favours”, little presents for their wedding guests.“She said, ‘Well, if they don’t work, no one’s going to put you in jail,’” he says. And nobody did, because his paintings are pretty fine they sell for thousands of dollars. He shows me some on his phone. They’re expressionist, full of bright colours – “South American colours: Stella is Colombian” – and he’s working towards a show next year in St Petersburg, which he’s very excited about.“Ask me more questions!” he says. He doesn’t want to waste time sitting around while the photographer sets up. We talk animals. He and Stella collect stray cats and dogs. We talk politics. He doesn’t care about Trump he doesn’t vote. He takes a widescreen approach to politics, because focusing on the detail makes him too unhappy. “I don’t vote because I don’t trust anyone. We’ve never got it right, human beings. We are all a mess, and we’re very early in our evolution. Look back throughout history: you have the 20th century, the murder of 100 million people, barely 80 years ago. The 1914-18 war, the civil war in America, slaughter, bloodshed… I don’t know if there’s a design in it, but it is extraordinary to look at it and get a perspective. I think, ‘Well, if it’s the end, there’s nothing we can do about it, and it’ll blow over, whatever happens.’”He remembers talking to his father on the phone during the Cuban missile crisis (“and I was a raving Marxist then”) and his father remarking that the bomb would be dropped on London, so Hopkins would be all right, “because the bomb will drop on you, so you won’t know much about it. But in Wales, we’ll suffer the fallout.” His dad also once said to him, about Hitler and the second world war, “Six years later, he was dead in a bunker. So much for the Third Reich”, which makes me laugh.Now he avoids news and politics, for his peace of mind. “In America, they’re obsessed with healthy food,” he says. “They tell you, if you eat junk food, you get fat and you die. Well, television is run by money and corporate power and sponsorship. It’s junk food for the brain. Toxic.” If he’s not busy, he orders books online and sends them to friends – Wake Up And Live! by Dorothea Brande, The Life-Changing Magic Of Not Giving A F**k by Sarah Knight – or watches old films and TV on his iPad. He was obsessed with Breaking Bad, and wrote a lovely letter to Bryan Cranston extolling his acting now, he likes watching Midsomer Murders, The Persuaders and Rosemary \u0026amp Thyme.We talk a bit about the #MeToo movement. Hopkins says, about Harvey Weinstein, “I did know about the person you are referring to, about his sexual stuff. I know he is a rude man and a tyrant. But I avoided him, I didn’t want anything to do with people like that. Bullies.” And actually, despite his desire to live and let live, Hopkins often calls bullies out: when John Dexter, the director of M Butterfly, started shouting at everyone in the cast, Hopkins told him to stop. “I said, ‘John, you don’t need to do this. You’re a great director. Stop it.’ And he cried. I mean, I understand if people are bullies. They’ve got their problems. I can’t judge them, I won’t make fun of them at awards. It’s correct for women to stand up for themselves, because it’s unacceptable. But I don’t have a desire to dance on anyone’s grave.”He understands that we can all be terrible, and we can all be kind. Fame and power have nothing to do with it. I tell Hopkins something the singer Tony Bennett once said – “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough” – and he is delighted. “How extraordinary. What an amazing thing to say! You know, I meet young people, and they want to act and they want to be famous, and I tell them, when you get to the top of the tree, there’s nothing up there. Most of this is nonsense, most of this is a lie. Accept life as it is. Just be grateful to be alive.”He shows me a picture on his phone. It’s of him aged three, with his dad on a beach near Aberavon. His dad is grinning. Hopkins is a cherubic child, with golden curls, caught somewhere between laughing and crying. “I was upset because I’d dropped a cough sweet.” He keeps it because it reminds him of how far he’s come.“I think, ‘Good God, I should be in Port Talbot.’ Either dead, or working in my father’s bakery. For some inexplicable reason I’m here, and none of it makes sense. And I look at him and I say, ‘We did OK, kid.’”• King Lear is on BBC2 on Monday 28 May.Commenting on this piece?

So it is with a giddy sense of expectation that I await the arrival of this sequelprequel hybrid. “Last time we gave you the happy ending,” burbles the trailer: ‘This summer we’ll take you back to the beginning.’ Thus, we find Lily James as the young Meryl Streep in sunny ’79, trying on her new dungarees, and trying out three handsome suitors (Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan and Jeremy Irvine), who will grow up to become Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Pierce “Pick-a-note-any-note” Brosnan. Meanwhile, Amanda Seyfried calls upon her mum’s old chums for guidance through her own pregnancy in an idyllic island rerun of former events – “only this time we know who the father is!” It’s hard to imagine director Ol Parker improving on the bizarre brilliance of Phyllida Lloyd’s record-breaking original, but the prospect of Andy Garcia playing a character named (guess what?) Fernando has already got me in a tizzy. A few weeks ago, I walked past Benny and Björn in the foyer of a London screening room and was so starstruck that I had to sit down and gather myself. Their songbook has so far proved to be indestructible let’s see what this sequel throws at it. MKAmerican writer-director Ari Aster’s astonishing debut film premiered in the January snows of Sundance, but releasing it to audiences in June was probably an act of mercy: once you emerge from this nerve-destroying horror, you might just need a bit of balmy summer warmth (or at least some tepid English drizzle) to thaw your bones. Comparisons to The Exorcist, often thrown around too carelessly by critics, are earned this time. The story of a suburban family thrown into a nightmarish, haunted grief spiral after granny kicks the bucket, it reassembles familiar elements from possession thrillers and haunted-house hack jobs into something that feels genuinely, demonically inventive – the less you know going in, the better. The scares here are extreme, but not cheap: Aster riddles the story with psychic pain and complex family dynamics, and it’s galvanised by Toni Collette’s stunningly primal performance as the raddled mother at the centre of the chaos. It may just be the greatest work of the Australian actor’s career that it comes wrapped in the most artful and frankly terrifying horror film in aeons is one of the summer’s happiest surprises.GLDirector Brad Bird always maintained that he would only make a sequel to The Incredibles if he could come up with a story that was as good as or better than that of the original. And, after a 14-year gap, we are about to discover what tempted him back to family life with Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and the kids. This much is known: the sequel sees Bob, AKA Mr Incredible, adjust to one of biggest challenges of his super-career – that of stay-at-home dad to Violet, Dash and the uniquely gifted super-baby Jack-Jack. Fans of the original will be hoping for more nefarious villainy, a planet in peril and a reprise of the gorgeous retro-futurist aesthetic that made The Incredibles the best looking of all the Pixar movies.WIThe second feature from Desiree Akhavan, the director of 2014’s bisexual indie drama Appropriate Behaviour is as witty and sexy as its predecessor, but goes to a darker and more introspective place. Chloë Grace Moretz plays the titular Cameron, a lesbian teenager who has been sent to a Christian gay conversion camp (much like in Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader) where young people are psychoanalysed and brainwashed into being straight. SSA (“same sex attraction”) is treated as a disease, making it a potent examination of internalised homophobia and more general teenage self-hatred, though the film is buoyed by joyously good-bad early 90s fashion and music, and American Honey’s Sasha Lane as “Jane Fonda”, a teen marijuana farmer with a prosthetic leg.SHSeeing charismatic non-professionals on screen has long been a part of cinema’s daily bread – at least since Luchino Visconti gave centre stage to a Sicilian fishing community in 1948’s La Terra Trema. But every now and then, this working method gets a fresh boost – as it does in Jonas Carpignano’s A Ciambra, in which Italian neo-realism lives again, with an executive-producer helping hand from Martin Scorsese. Carpignano previously paid a visit to the port community of Gioia Tauro in south-western Italy in his 2015 refugee crisis drama Mediterranea. Here he returns to some of the same characters – members of the real-life Roma family the Amatos, notably 14-year-old Pio, in a coming-of-age story about breaking away from the dominion of the reigning local hoods to start a criminal career of his own. This Calabrian-dialect drama crackles with unruly energy and sense of place, and Pio Amato is one of those screen naturals that come along only every few now and thens.JR“A rescue op to save the dinosaurs from an island that’s about to explode – what could go wrong?” In 2015, Jurassic World served up an eye-poppingly empty spectacle in which the digitally rendered 3D beasties seemed altogether more lifelike than their two-dimensional human counterparts. So why get excited about this fifth Jurassic instalment? Largely because it’s directed by Spanish maestro JA Bayona, whose CV ranges from the spine-tingling chills of The Orphanage to the sublime fantasia of A Monster Calls via the real-life tragedies of The Impossible. How much of his personal stamp Bayona will be able to imprint on this corporate behemoth remains to be seen the trailer looks very smashy-crashy. But Jeff Goldblum is back (hooray!) pontificating about natural order, and the supporting cast includes an ever so slightly sinister-looking Toby Jones (hooray again!) banging a gavel. Fingers crossed. MKSimple but sharp, and emotionally intense, this British debut by Daniel Kokotajlo offers rare insight into an enclosed and little understood community – the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Set in Manchester, it’s a story of a mother (Siobhan Finneran) and her two daughters, Alex and Luisa (Molly Wright, Sasha Parkinson), raised according to the faith’s rigorous code. But Luisa, discovering other possibilities in life, finds herself “disfellowshipped” – barred from the community and contact with her family. The brilliance of Apostasy is testimony to the fact that storytelling sometimes works best when film-makers are prepared to follow the unexpected path, at the risk of throwing their audience. Kokotajlo’s own background as a Witness brings a meticulously observed authenticity, and superb performances open up deep personal dimensions in this trenchant inquiry into the cost of fundamentalist fervour. JRWorking-class and slightly goofy-looking, Lee Alexander McQueen was, on paper, unlikely to even break into the hallowed world of high fashion, let alone become one of its brightest stars. But as this thrilling, troubling documentary demonstrates, McQueen had the kind of white-hot talent that is impossible to ignore. However, the problem with anything white hot is that it tends to burn out quickly, leaving plenty of wounded people in its wake. The (savage) beauty of this documentary by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui is that it goes beyond the admittedly fascinating life story of British fashion’s enfant terrible. The film attempts to capture the grand guignol theatricality of McQueen’s designs and – in particular – the often controversial shows.Bonhôte and Ettedgui embellish the narrative with skulls and shadows, imagery from a baroque nightmare or a glimpse into the psyche of the designer himself. It goes without saying that this will be on the must-see list for anyone remotely interested in fashion. But McQueen was more than just a frock designer: he was both a cultural icon and an iconoclast an avant garde artist and an East End geezer who camped up his cockney accent. The appeal of this vivid portrait will be similarly far-reaching. WIIt has been so long since Hollywood released a proper studio romantic comedy. Not failed feminist thinkpieces like I Feel Pretty watered-down imitations of the genre à la Home Again or chemistry vacuums like the Fifty Shades franchise but a fun, glossy, big-budget movie with a capital M. Which is why I’m so excited about Warner Brothers’ Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s 2013 bestselling novel.The plot is a classic culture clash: born and bred New Yorker Rachel Chu (Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu) attends an ornate wedding in Singapore with boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding), only to discover that his relatives are crazy rich (and judging by the trailer, pretty bonkers also). Petty drama, a disapproving mother-in-law, a bawdy best friend, sex, romance and a sweeping pop soundtrack? Yes please. Even better, it’s a majority Asian cast (you’d hope so, considering the title, but with Asian characters recently rewritten for Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton in Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange respectively, it’s not a given), and the first contemporary film of its kind from a Hollywood studio since 1993’s The Joy Luck Club. SHEver since I was a child, I have been a sucker for a shark movie. Whether it’s a classy, fine-whittled tension exercise like Jaws or The Shallows or an all-out trash attack like the Sharknado series, any combination of watery peril, bad movie science and big gnashing chompers is delirious comfort viewing to me.So this thrillingly stupid-looking thriller – locking the redoubtable Jason Statham in combat with a 75-foot megalodon surging from the depths of extinction – has been an easy choice for my most anticipated title of the summer ever since the gaudy, perfectly absurd trailer hit the internet a few months back. Hopes are high that this could prove the new century’s Deep Blue Sea, and if you understand why that’s an exciting prospect, then you are one of my people.

His flying, acrobatic volley, only two minutes after coming on, will go straight into the list of the greatest all-time goals in a Champions League final and put Madrid, with their 13th triumph, on their way to emulating the great Ajax and Bayern Munich teams of the 1970s with a third successive win.That, however, tells only part of the story from a night when Karius was a danger to his own team, responsible for Madrid’s two other goals and last seen wandering aimlessly around the pitch – alone, distraught and clearly traumatised – to ask forgiveness, hands clasped, from the thousands of Liverpool supporters. Karius looked broken. He chose a bad night to be so vulnerable and Liverpool will always wonder what might have happened if the German had not turned the night into his own personal ordeal. Or, indeed, if they had not lost Salah, half an hour in, with the shoulder injury that turned the match in Madrid’s favour.Salah looked inconsolable as he was led from the pitch and Sergio Ramos had some nerve offering a sympathetic hug on the way off. Ramos had locked Salah’s right arm and turned him, judo-style, as they lost balance going for the same ball. Television replays hardened the suspicion it was a calculated move on Ramos’s part and, when Salah landed with a hell of a thud, the damage was considerable. That blow could conceivably put the Egyptian out of the World Cup, too.His absence was a grievous setback for Liverpool, who had looked the more dangerous team until that point, and it would not be sour grapes for the losers to think that was the moment the game started to swing away from them. They had started so thrillingly but all their early momentum was lost once Salah went off. It never properly came back and the players in red took a long time – too long, probably – to adjust to being without the man who had scored 44 times over a record-breaking season. Without Salah, they never looked so threatening again.Ultimately, though, the difficult truth for Liverpool, and the tragic Karius, is that two of the goals they conceded were almost beyond comprehension, and how many times has Jürgen Klopp been warned this team risks being undermined by the lack of an elite goalkeeper? Karius has too much previous for this to be considered a one-off and, as goalkeeping mistakes go, his errors in the 51st and 83rd minutes were as bad as one another. In fact, they were not just bad. They were appalling, so wretched it was difficult to recall a worse goalkeeping performance in any major final through the years.His meltdown – for that is exactly what it was – started with the opening goal when he came to the edge of his penalty area to collect a ball that Toni Kroos, trying to set Karim Benzema free, had overhit. All Karius had to do was pick up the ball and roll it to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right of defence. He got the second part horribly wrong, as if unaware that Benzema was still lurking, and the striker was able to flick out a boot to intercept the underarm throw. That was all it needed and, almost in slow motion, the ball trickled into an exposed goal.Liverpool’s equaliser came within four minutes. James Milner swung the ball over from a corner on the right and Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, was alive in the six-yard area. Dejan Lovren won the header and, when Mané flashed his shot past Keylor Navas, it seemed as though Klopp’s team might have the momentum again.Instead Zinedine Zidane turned to Bale, playing possibly his final game for Madrid, and it was an incredible way in which the Welshman announced his presence – a twisting, mid-air bicycle kick to redirect Marcelo’s left-wing cross and flash the ball into Liverpool’s net. Zidane against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002? Mario Mandzukic for Juventus in 2017? Bale’s effort belongs in the same category. There was even applause from Liverpool’s fans when it was replayed on the giant screens.At 2-1 Liverpool came back again and Mané, in particular, kept threatening, fizzing a low shot against the post. Yet Bale was clearly emboldened by his first goal and, when he let fly again from 40 yards, the ball swerved in front of Karius and went through the goalkeeper’s hands. Perhaps Karius’s confidence had been damaged by the earlier mistake. Maybe the swerve was deceptive. At this level, however, there can be no excuses for such a mistake and, in that exact moment, everyone inside the Olimpiyskiy Stadium must have known there was no way back for Liverpool. If anything, they were fortunate not to suffer more damage in the second half. Madrid could also look back on Isco hitting the crossbar and there was an extraordinary moment when Cristiano Ronaldo was shaping to shoot only to be interrupted by a pitch invader from the end where the Madridistas were going through their victory songs.For the most part Liverpool had contained Ronaldo and Klopp’s team had often played well, particularly before Salah’s injury. The problem was that their goalkeeper had the worst night of his professional life. It was a sixth successive defeat for Klopp in a major final and at the final whistle, with Karius burying his face into the turf, there was not exactly a stampede of team-mates wanting to console him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb787af3d20119b41b7d666ca0bd0bed3ebd1ee/0_497_3025_1815/master/3025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9851d2c4900c150eaf98e2c289d2a303","title":"real madrid liverpool champions league final player ratings","story":"Substitute Gareth Bale is man of the match while Loris Karius’s howlers surely leave his Liverpool career in tattersKeylor Navas 710 Lucky not to be punished by Van Dijk when he missed a corner but one his safer goalkeeping displays.

Tidy as always but only got into harmful areas when the game opened up.Casemiro 710 The unheralded but key part of this Real Madrid team performed effectively and diligently as usual, helping to curb Firmino’s influence on the Liverpool display.Toni Kroos 610 Operated too deep throughout the final and that left Ronaldo and Benzema isolated too often as a consequence. His passing was below its usual standard, too.Isco 610 Always searched for openings but could not get involved enough. Wasted a great chance to put that right when he hit the bar with only Karius to beat.Karim Benzema 810 May have been fortunate for the opener but, like any good striker, was alert to the possibility when Karius erred. Fared well in his physical battle with Van Dijk.Cristiano Ronaldo 710 A rarity in that this was a major final that the world player of the year did not bend to his will. May have done better with one header that Karius saved well.Nacho 710 (for Carvajal 37): A strong and positive replacement for the injured CarvajalGareth Bale 910 (for Isco 61): What an impact. Off the bench to win the final with a world-class goalMarco Asensio 510 (for Benzema 89): Brought on in the dying seconds as Zidane sought fresh legsLoris Karius 310 Two absolute howlers on the biggest stage of all. An appalling performance from which it will be difficult to resurrect a Liverpool career.Trent Alexander-Arnold 710 Again seen as a potential weak link and again responded manfully to keep Ronaldo relatively quiet. More of a problem when Marcelo advanced, though.Dejan Lovren 710 Set the tone for another impressive European display when he snapped into Ronaldo at the first opportunity. Won the header for Mané’s goal.Virgil van Dijk 710 May feel he should have done better with the header from Milner’s corner that Navas missed but fought well against Benzema and made timely interceptions.Andy Robertson 810 Good in the air and, as usual, his positive runs down the left posed a frequent problem to the Real defence. Superb tackle on Ronaldo stopped a certain goal.Georginio Wijnaldum 610 The most inventive of Liverpool’s midfield trio but could not get on the ball often enough truly to hurt his opponents. Drove the team forward to the end.Jordan Henderson 610 Neat and careful on the ball and worked hard defensively to prevent Isco having an influence on the final but unable to stamp his authority on the game.James Milner 710 His set-piece deliveries were Liverpool’s most potent weapon once Salah had gone. Also pressed ferociously from the start to help swarm the Real midfield.Mohamed Salah 510 Not how his phenomenal season was supposed to end. Left the pitch in tears and in agony after Sergio Ramos caused a shoulder injury that damaged Liverpool. Cruel.Roberto Firmino 610 So close to connecting with one header, threaded a brilliant ball into Mané and worked tirelessly but could not influence this European game as he has so many others.Sadio Mané 810 Stepped up after Salah’s injury and was Liverpool’s liveliest forward. Showed quick reactions to draw Klopp’s team level and unlucky to strike a post, too.Adam Lallana 510 (for Salah 30): Plunged into the game early due to Salah’s injury and not at his sharpest after injuryEmre Can 610 (for Milner 83): Brought on for a late rescue mission but to no avail in the end"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60b3739fd853711f79eadcdf302f45c7c2e7ff/1072_475_3594_2156/master/3594.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ae17de11250352014084ae70ba8d76b","title":"gareth bale real madrid could be glorious farewell","story":"F or a moment there was silence and then there was a small smattering of applause. At the Liverpool end, they were stunned, and they were not alone. The goal that won the European Cup had to be watched twice and they still couldn’t believe it even the replay on the giant screen didn’t entirely shake them out of it. For the second time, they were left wondering if that had really happened. The first time was surreal, the second sublime. Gareth Bale had been on the pitch for only two minutes when he took flight. High in the Kiev sky, he connected with a wonderful overhead kick.Bale ran to the corner and threw himself to the turf, sliding face-down. Cristiano Ronaldo followed his team-mates over to the Welshman. On the far touchline Zinedine Zidane could barely believe it. He scored the winning goal in the 2002 European Cup final at Hampden Park, a volley that became emblematic. When Ronaldo scored an overhead kick in Turin in the quarter-final this year, Juventus’s fans had stood to applaud. Afterwards Zidane had been asked about it. “Mine was nicer,” he smiled, a twinkle in his eye.Even he may admit that Bale’s was better. Just as even Karim Benzema may admit that his goal was the worst he has scored – even as it may be the most important, his first in a European Cup final. Between them, they had taken Madrid to a third title in a row, history made. For Bale, it is his fourth Champions League title since moving to Spain. It may well be his last. If so, this was some way to bid farewell. Or perhaps it can be a new beginning. It was, after all, a moment beyond the reach of the plausible, like something out of a\u0026nbspcomic.Now the European Cup final had a moment worthy of it. Until then, and speaking of comic, the final had been marked by two moments. Loris Karius throwing the ball against Benzema’s boot and into the net and, before that, Sergio Ramos dragging Mohamed Salah to the ground, forcing him out of this final and seeming to change the game entirely. Even if Liverpool did find an equaliser, thus requiring Zidane to call on Bale. So, on he came, to score the decisive second.And then, with a few minutes left, to get the third. Scorer in Lisbon, successful in the shootout in Milan, he had done it again in Ukraine. Twice. The shot looped and slipped through Karius’s hands. The goalkeeper was embarrassed, Bale didn’t care, leaping in the other corner now. Here he was on the pitch, his moment, his final – one he had not even started.Bale’s absence from the starting XI was not out of keeping with his season: it had started on Valentine’s Day, when he was left out against Paris Saint-Germain, an unexpected decision which was soon revealed as no one-off, not least because of the sense that he did little to rebel when he came on, seeming instead to disengage. In the second leg he was again left on the bench. In Turin it was the same and although he started the second leg, he was withdrawn at half-time, with the team 2-0 down. He withdrew at full-time too, while his team-mates celebrated. “I had to do something,” Zidane said afterwards. But, Bale wondered, did it have to be that? There had been no explanation, no conversation he and Zidane did not talk.Against Bayern Munich there was more of the same. Madrid had made it to the final but he had played only 99 of 540 minutes in the knockout phases. And yet his performance in Villarreal last week, widely assumed to be a dress rehearsal, the gathering speed and the specifics of Liverpool, had brought him back into a focus, a candidate to be included from the start for the final. Instead, it was the same XI that began in Cardiff in last year’s final, Benzema beginning ahead of him then, Bale was injured here there was no excuse. No consolation, either – that would come later.When Madrid’s subs came out to warm up, the Welshman did not join them. That is not so abnormal but as a staging of his separateness it is still striking. He too has become resigned to the probability of a departure. Bale, though, knew that there might always be a chance, that at least things could go the right way. Liverpool knew that Madrid could change the game from the bench in a way that they could not.In victory Bale said he was “obviously very disappointed not to start the game, so the best I could do was come on and make an impact – and that’s what I did. It has to be the best goal I’ve ever scored. Just happy to get the win. We know what we’ve achieved and how good we’ve been. We let everyone else speak, we know how hungry and determined we are and we showed it again today.”Asked about a return to the Premier League, he said: “I need to be playing week-in, week-out and that hasn’t happened this season for one reason or another. I have to sit down in the summer and discuss my future with my agent and take it from there.”A couple of months ago it had been suggested to him that for all that he had not been playing, for all that he had thought his time at Madrid was coming to an end, and that much as he would not start in Kiev, he would come on and win the final. Even if he had believed it, he would not have imagined it like this. An overhead kick, a long shot that Karius dropped into the net, and a fourth European Cup. No Briton has won more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38358fdf7bafb2a64f88153127a163e4049147b7/761_117_1754_1053/master/1754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e90caf6ce90c12fac246003da7a4a9","title":"liverpool mohamed salah cruel end real madrid sergio ramos champions league","story":"What did Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos intend when grabbing the Egyptian’s arm? He might say he was reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive approach. Either way Salah was doneAnd fade to white. By the end of a messy, thrilling, occasionally grisly Champions League final in Kiev the most unexpected note was that Liverpool’s fearless run to this stage should end with regrets and a quiver of what might have been.It seemed even crueller still that the final image of Mo Salah’s joyful season should be the sight of the Premier League player of the year leaving the pitch in tears with half an hour gone. But then there are reasons why Real Madrid win these games, why the same faces keep on being framed by the cameras year after year lifting that intoxicatingly shiny trophy. Or in other words: Mo, meet Sergio.Madrid were the story here: three-times champions, with victory capped by an overhead kick from Gareth Bale of such devastating grace that even the Liverpool end offered him a ripple of bruised applause as Madrid lined up for the restart.Yet there will be a sense through red-tinted spectacles of having been cheated by fate, by misfortune and by Sergio Ramos.Make no mistake Liverpool had their moments to take this game by the scruff, most obviously in the opening quarter when they went for the full, blitz attack, drawing stumbles and stutters and hoofed clearances as those princely white shirts looked a little giddy. Liverpool can do this to you, swarming in with the body shots, taking your breath, making the pitch spin. Something had to give. It did. The wrong thing.Nobody will ever really know what Ramos intended as he grabbed Mo Salah’s arm and tumbled to the ground. No foul was awarded, even with Salah lying in agony holding his shoulder. Probably this was simply an innocent coming-together. In slow motion it looked like an expert secret service judo move, the kind of thing you spend three years learning to pull off in a camp in the Swiss Alps, along wth the blow dart to the neck and the sword-stick umbrella jab.Ramos might say he was giving some back in kind, reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive style. Either way Salah was done, soldiering on for a few moments before going down in distress clutching a dislocated shoulder. Ramos, svengali of white-shirted bastardism, loves these games. Here he seized another by the throat and squeezed at the vital moment.Instantly the weather inside the stadium changed. The excellent Sadio Mané was switched from the left where he had been traumatising Dani Carvajal. The red shirts seemed winded – and within six minutes of half-time Madrid were in front, Loris Karius producing a gut-wrenching error, placing the ball on the end of Karim Benzema’s foot in front of an open goal from a simple throw-out.Liverpool did not let it drop. Four minutes later they were level, Mané nipping in at a corner to poke the ball past Keylor Navas, drawing a vast cheer at that end and another note in the pure pleasure that has soundtracked this run to Kiev and which will remain even now the dominant note of a lost May weekend in Ukraine.What is black and white and red all over? Kiev of course. Or at least it was for one sun-drenched afternoon as Liverpool’s travelling support added a great sweaty replica-shirted smear of red to the washed out greens and blues and greys.They came in vans and coaches and cars. They came via Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Throughout the day they packed Shevchenko park with a bobbing, burping, chanting mass of sun-flushed flesh and filled the side-street bars with a travel-frazzled sense of Soviet-tinged dolce vita.As the minutes ticked down to kick-off there was a familiar feeling of ravenousness and an impatience around the pre-match hoopla, capped by the massed kitchen foil-clad dancers of the great Dua Lipa, who eventually appeared bouncing gamely on top of a blue and yellow birthday cake stage.Even with Salah off, this game was still there. Mané hit the post. Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled manfully with Marcelo, sniping inside like a horribly malevolent giant tarantula. But without that glaze of genius, the switch of gear that Salah brings, Madrid were able to purr forward.Still it took another painful howler from Karius to kill the game as he let a Bale shot spill through the most brittle of pasta-wristed punches. This was a professional tragedy for a footballer in the biggest match of his life, on a stage to which he will surely never return.But it was also not entirely surprising. Jürgen Klopp persuaded Karius to sign for Liverpool in the first place, then made him his number one. At the end of which, and when it really matters, Karius has made a pair of match-killing howlers. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Kiev and beyond, the sun continues to rise, dogs still bite postmen, brown bears still seek out the treeline when nature calls. A new goalkeeper looked like an essential summer signing even before tonight.The intersection of luck and design is always a difficult area in sport. Here Liverpool could only bring on a half-fit Adam Lallana for Salah. Madrid could call on Bale, Salah’s equivalent as a player but able to lurk potently on the bench.Liverpool will leave Kiev a little bruised but also with a sense that their one real shot at this game, that full-throttle Plan A, was derailed in the coldest fashion by a more seasoned, powerfully stocked team of champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577619abec3d220cdad2bfcdd2936514c6ac18ae/0_0_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e4f91cf7799b594dba00f6e9b74a062","title":"jane fonda interview film book club im 80 i cant believe it racism cosmetic surgery","story":"Jane Fonda has ruined me. I never want to interview anyone under the age of 80 again. Specifically, I never want to interview anyone who isn’t 80, and who doesn’t phone me for a catch-up call from a limo in Cannes, in which they are being driven to the airport, having gone to a deeply glamorous film festival party the night before and now finding themselves, as Fonda puts it delicately, “slightly hungover”. Fonda isn’t even hugely interested in Cannes these days, not like back in the day “when people wore their own clothes and went there to talk about movies”.No, she’s hungover in the limo, but wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement about what she has recently learned of the mass incarceration of African-Americans in her country and how it isn’t enough for white women like her to be empathetic. They have to stand up and make this stop, because America is a country built on slavery and it isn’t over yet.It’s a continuation of the conversation that began a few days previously, when I met her backstage at the Ellen DeGeneres chat show in Los Angeles. Fonda was preparing to promote her new film, Book Club, in which she plays one of four women who have reached a certain age, read Fifty Shades of Grey in their book club, and decided to do something about their passions. The link between spicing up your sex life and committing to ending gross inequality might not be an obvious one, but she explains that Book Club is about female solidarity and women having each other’s backs, and so is much of her “feminist activism”. Even though, when she first got interested in politics, she had just starred in the 1968 erotic sci-fi film Barbarella “and I took a lot of heat on it from feminists. The new women’s movement was in its early stages and there was a lot of…” she adopts a comically stern voice: “‘How do you feel making a movie that exploits women, like Barbarella?’ You’d kind of want to say: ‘Well, honey, nobody forced me.’ But,” she concedes, “it wasn’t much fun to make it.”Fonda’s small, white, fluffy dog Tulear is perched beside her. She actually wanted to name the dog Barbarella, but her daughter Vanessa, whose father, Roger Vadim, directed the film, wasn’t keen.If Book Club is a sort of geriatric Sex and the City, then Fonda plays the Samantha character, a leopardskin-clad businesswoman who schedules sex and won’t commit. “Vivian is sassy, she doesn’t want any emotional entanglements, and that was kind of fun.” Fonda explains that back in the early 20th century, “before there were the Nielsen ratings or whatever, the censor, there were actresses such as Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae West playing dangerous women – the parts they played were like guys. Then puritanism crept in. But I think there are going to be more women-centric movies, like Book Club, now. A lot of these movies are doing well, and I don’t think this is a phase – I think this is it.”Jane Fonda was born in 1937, the daughter of the actor Henry Fonda, and while her life was socially privileged, her home life was agony, and her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, killed herself in a psychiatric hospital. (Fonda was 12 and only found out that her mother’s death was suicide from a movie magazine – nobody ever spoke to her about it.) Jane herself was also sexually abused and in her memoirs she writes movingly about the concept of disembodiment – how it took her until the age of 62 to fully inhabit her own body.Her marriage to Ted Turner had just ended, “and I was single again and I realised… I’m not scared,” she says of it now. “I was alone in the house, looking out through my own eyes and I could live inside my own skin. It was a revelation. It was something else.”How painful is it that it took so long to get herself back?“I feel very sad that so many girls are abused all over the world and that men don’t understand what it does to them. It’s not something that happens lightly, it can alter a person. And then you have to be very intentional about getting back into your own skin, but it can be done. It wasn’t so much that I felt sad about all the wasted time, because I wasn’t fully authentic, but on the other hand, why not instead just be proud of yourself that you got there and you didn’t stop trying?”She also links plastic surgery to sexual abuse and has said that when she sees the face “of a woman who has made herself into a mask, I always think to myself… I wonder, I wonder.” She had her own breast implants taken out and has also had several facelifts of which she says she is not proud.As for #MeToo, is it also painful to not have had such a movement 50 years ago? Fonda once again takes my negative and turns it into a positive.“I am very grateful to be alive through this,” she says softly. “I did not think I would live to see it. Yes. And I think that it’s going to continue, it’s not just a moment. I love the Time’s Up aspect of it. We’re working with women from all different places. I’m going to DC to lobby with domestic workers. The farm workers up in Bakersfield. It’s all of us together, having each other’s backs.”This is why she made the film 9 to 5 in 1980, which became one of Hollywood’s highest grossing comedies ever, despite its subject matter of the awful way men treated women in the workplace. Fonda wants to produce a new version of the film, with younger actors, who now find their work life even more precarious on zero-hours contracts. We discuss the state of the labour unions in the United States. “So all this is not so new for me. But it is for a lot of other actors, and that’s why it’s a very valuable thing to hear what other women in other industries have to put up with, women who are much more vulnerable than we are.”I have to say it: Jane Fonda looks stunning, immaculately coiffed and made up, and with the poise and elegance that has always been hers. It’s thanks to a lifetime of fitness regimes for which everyone remembers her videos, and also to the facelifts. But they, she says, were more about survival in her industry than about vanity. “They bought me an extra 10 years.” Like it or not, it does seem to be true. How many other 80-year-old women currently have a hit comedy series on Netflix (Grace and Frankie), as well as movies coming out, a documentary on their life about to hit HBO, and no signs of stopping any time soon?Of course this is all down to much more than surgery: it is the third act of a career that began more than half a century ago and has involved two Oscars for Best Actress (and a further five nominations) along the way. Curiously, it is the fitness videos that people in the UK remember her for the most. In the States, there are still people who boycott Jane Fonda’s films because of how deeply involved she got in protesting against the Vietnam war. Not that any of that stopped her.In Grace and Frankie, which is now approaching its fifth season, she and Lily Tomlin’s character become accidental, grumpy housemates after their husbands fall in love with each other. When I tell people I’m going to interview Jane Fonda, a surprisingly wide range of people tell me how much they love that show. “I know,” she says, her voice dropping to an absolute whisper. “We’re stunned. We did not expect that. We’re trying to figure it out!” she hisses.She loves working with her old friend Tomlin “because she’s a working-class gal who grew up in a fascinating family. People visit the set who were with her in elementary school. She is just so funny – and I’ve tried to learn that from her. But it just comes naturally to her.” Surely you’re funny, too, I say. “Oh no,” replies Fonda, “I don’t have a natural funny bone. I come from a long line of depressed people.” She laughs.Having been married several times and lived with various partners, and recently split up with her last boyfriend, the music producer Richard Perry (she describes him as “a younger man” – she also wrote a blog about him having Parkinson’s), Fonda now lives in a gated retirement enclave with her own house, but a shared community centre with a pool and tennis courts “where I always see one or two other residents who seem infinitely older than I am, but they probably aren’t. I never thought I would ever live there, but it’s great.”She does yoga and Pilates and has even made a whole new series of workout videos, “and their label is Prime Time, as they’re for older people. I can’t do the original workouts any more, because I’ll hurt myself,” she gestures to her hips, “as I have joint replacements.” In fact, she says her main form of exercise these days involves jumping into things “before I really know what I’m doing. It’s called a leap of faith and it’s my main form of exercise. It’s what keeps me young, too. That’s my new workout. When you take a leap of faith you don’t always land in the right place, but you sure do learn things. It’s good for the heart.”At the weekends, she leaves Los Angeles to go knocking on the door of Trump voters. “When you’re talking to them you can’t criticise Trump. You can’t criticise Fox News. All you can do is listen to what they care about and what they’re afraid of, and then maybe tell them something that they don’t know. Because we’re all in our bubbles, including me.” Do people recognise her? “I was in Bakersfield last Saturday and knocked on 30 doors. Only one person saw me coming and said: ‘Grace and Frankie!’ It was a kick! Nobody else knew who I was. I just say: ‘I’m Jane.’ They don’t need to know.”She has also been acting with Robert Redford again. I tell her that I recently watched Barefoot in the Park, the 1967 film where she and Redford are giddy newlyweds in New York, and then went to Netflix and watched Our Souls at Night, in which she and Redford reunited in 2017 to play widowed grandparents who get together to end their loneliness.I tell her it was a really beautiful night of cinema, to see these two actors come back together with their war wounds, their egos bruised, their hearts more honest in later life. To my surprise, Fonda’s eyes start to water. “Ohh,” she says softly. “It moves me that you say that.”She has said that she was always in love with him when they worked together, but they were always married to other people. He said recently that he had no idea she loved him. Do they keep in touch? Send texts? “Oh no. He doesn’t text, number one two, he’s a loner. So that’s that.” She says she won’t ever fall in love again. “I love men, I’m not done with men, but I’m done with marriage and dating.”Fonda is unimpressed by the romance in many modern films. “I’m not a big mouth opener on camera. Every time I see a love scene with young ones – they come at each other like this…” she mimes a big wide-open slobbering jaw, “…and I’m thinking, well where does the fun come in? Because the fun is the sensuality of lips. And then slowly moving beyond that. But not trying to swallow each other.” She giggles. “I would not want to go right into a tongue kiss, quite frankly.”And then Woody Harrelson walks past the dressing room. Fonda sends somebody to get him back. “I want to hug you!” she says, standing up to greet him. “I saw Three Billboards again last night because I had a house guest who hadn’t seen it. You’re so good Woody, God!” she says. “You’re so good, Jane!” says a glowing, goofy Harrelson. It’s like watching a peacock hug a panda.And then they both have to go off and be on the telly, and I am left with the sense of having just been visited by grace and greatness.Book Club is in cinemas from 1 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb986e5bfaca0a78bc839d761981b22f633fbe80/0_69_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bfcbfab0041613146fd6b0b26261a","title":"martin parr day at the chelsea flower show a photo essay","story":"Magnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyMagnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyJust one woman at Chelsea, peering through a thicket of foxgloves with a wry smile on her face, has clocked the quiet man in the brown shirt, owner of the most famously satirical eye in British photography. Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da138a6edf63a6fa1b148fb0be1071e8b2d6c1ba/0_36_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfae75880a5794f136260fa984bfb10e","title":"gay hussar soho to shut soho labour lunches plots gossip","story":"The Gay Hussar is among the most celebrated restaurants in London but its fame rests not so much on the quality of its chilled wild-cherry soup and its goulash, but on its reputation as the beating heart of political gossip.The Hungarian restaurant in the centre of Soho has played host to generations of politicians, many drawn from the left, including Aneurin Bevan, Michael Foot, Tom Driberg, Ian Mikardo and Barbara Castle. It is also rumoured to be where the Tory wets fruitlessly plotted the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s.But after 65 years as a hotbed of political plotting, backstabbing, deal-making and gossip, it is due to close its doors for the last time in June.A combination of spiralling overheads, including business rates and rent, and a slump in lunchtime bookings – with politicians no longer prepared to trek over from Westminster for inevitably lengthy alcohol-fuelled lunches – has sounded the death knell for the eccentric establishment. Its owner, Corus Hotels, is closing the restaurant and selling the lease. Distraught staff have been told to expect to serve up the final meals on\u0026nbsp21 June.The three-storey restaurant in Greek Street staved off a threat of closure in 2013 when Corus – the UK arm of a Malaysian conglomerate that also owns Laura Ashley – put it on the market. That led to 160 politicians and journalists banding together as the so-called Goulash Co-operative, requiring a minimum investment of £500, and offering to chip in to buy it.In the end, with no decent offer on the table, Corus agreed to keep the restaurant open, giving it a minor rebrand as GH Soho, although with the restaurant’s traditional interiors and old-school meaty menu left largely unchanged.The Goulash Co-operative is again attempting a rescue – galvanising its membership with a new fundraising drive to add to the £150,000 already raised, and launching a plan not only to save the restaurant but to create an improved venue that better reflects changing tastes and trends.“We believe now is the time to create a new Gay Hussar, and are in talks with possible partners who agree with us that this unique establishment must be saved,” said the Goulash Co-operative’s spokesman John Goodman. “It’s showing its age. We have lots of exciting plans to renovate it, including installing a dumb waiter and a downstairs toilet.”Since it opened in 1953 it has been a haunt and popular watering hole of politicians, writers and artists. Devoted regulars have included the Labour grandees Roy Hattersley and Michael Foot – who celebrated his 90th birthday there – and more recently Gordon Brown. Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams had a regular table on the first floor, where he would bellow out whispered titbits from his informants. Election victories have been celebrated there and sorrows and defeats drowned with copious amounts of bull’s blood.It was founded by Victor Sassie, son of a Swiss father and Welsh mother, who trained for the restaurant trade partly in Hungary and opened his own establishment, the Budapest, in London in 1939. During the second world war, he worked for British military intelligence, and for Robert Maxwell after it. Sassie, who died in 1999, sold the Gay Hussar to the Restaurant Partnership in 1988.Over more than six decades the traditional decor of the open-plan ground-floor restaurant and two crimson-hued private rooms – connected by a narrow staircase – has barely changed, with every space and surface stuffed with books, caricatures and pictures.Downstairs, the wall-to-wall framed Martin Rowson cartoons of the political elite’s great and not-so-good – officially “on loan” from the artist – have been expanded to include the new generation of MPs, even if many choose not to dine there. The ground-floor dining room accommodates up to 40 diners, while two private rooms upstairs (with 25 and 12 covers) give scope for more discreet exchanges behind closed doors, over the dark wood tables and behind thick velvet drapes.Mark Seddon, the journalist and former Tribune editor and a member of the Goulash Co-operative, said: “There’s a lot of love for the place and we have plenty of ideas for reviving it. We think it has potential for literary events. It’s all very exciting.”Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said: “The action of Corus Hotels is deplorable and must be resisted. Supporters of the Gay Hussar have already raised a large sum with big and small donations. Now we must do that again to give us a fighting chance of securing the future of a restaurant which is part of political history.”Wrobel is not planning a farewell party on 21 June. “We will go quietly with a dignified ending,” he said. “There is nothing to celebrate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc15cd9723af94db422b4f5add87a9c05bba0443/0_336_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f14586beac8a2c66d64189795758b2","title":"a quick note to say thanks to my dad for always encouraging me to act","story":"Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge, 23, an actor who lives in London, thanks his dad for being his biggest fanI’d like to say thank you to my dad, Rod Cambridge, who encouraged me to get into acting.When I was a kid and he realised I was into acting, he chose to encourage me all the way.

Some will come directly, arriving on your phone at 4am in the masked form of links to feminist websites. Some will appear in your lap at the hairdressers, or hidden in an interview with a director whose film you keep meaning to see, or ripped carefully against a ruler and included in a birthday card from your mum. Some you will search out yourself, as if you are a woman creeping through a lonely house with a knife having heard glass break downstairs – better you catch this intruder, than it catches you.Depending on the decade in which you come of age, these stories will be focused on the importance of having children young, or old, or of freezing your eggs so you can think about it later, or of how to find the perfect mate, or of the liberating glee that comes with doing it alone. There will be an equal number, too, explaining the benefits of remaining childless, your fellow women in snazzy heels and shiny skin leaning in to tell you about the fulfilling life it is possible to lead without the weight of a kid round your neck and, indeed, the compelling political reasons why you should never procreate.But despite being different stories, they all have the same ending. They all suggest that having a child or not having a child is simply a matter of a woman’s decision. They force you to think about babies, even if your hormones aren’t interested. These stories poke at your intellect, your curiosity about life and its side-effects. And they all make you feel extremely weary. And anxious. And lonely, sometimes, and also, on bad nights, already 75 and regretful about the other life you could have led.Having waded through that swamp of commentary, and having emerged virtually unscathed, with (though I don’t like to boast) the best three-year-old in Britain, I was unprepared for the second chapter. While the pressure to have children is so well-documented, there are no warnings about the pressure to have a second. It sneaks in, like ants come summer. There are few glossy magazine articles about this – in fact, so ingrained is the importance of siblings in the swarming consciousness of our culture that, unlike the seemingly genuine questions about whether to procreate in the first place, the adjacent debate about having more than one focuses purely on whether the existing child will be ruined by their onlyness. The parents are no longer part of the conversation. And it’s a conversation that is much stickier, seeing as it is now seen to be less about what the family wants but about what the child needs.A mother’s decision not to do it again, for reasons ranging from the practical (they’d have to move house, they can’t afford maternity leave) to the emotional (she had postnatal depression, she found the weight of love painful, like a two-year hangover), is irrelevant when faced with the idea that it will screw up her kid. If you have a child, then you must have another. To choose to stop there, it seems, from the combination of frozen smiles and earthy anecdotes about the psychopathic only child they knew growing up, or the future sadness of this two-year-old having to organise your funeral without a sister, is to be not just selfish, but perverse. Mothers are ided, again, into good and bad.I remember quite confidently predicting that one of the great benefits of growing up later than our parents would be the inevitable camaraderie of my friends either having one child or none at all, yet living close enough to each other that it would feel like we were a big sprawling family, but without the daily fights about hairdryers. It didn’t happen. Instead, we either mirrored the journeys of our parents, slotting new families into the holes left behind, or blazed off into radical new futures far far away. The middle way, with one child and no marriage, seemed so much more sensible to 20-odd-year-old me – so much more portable, and affordable. So neat. And then I had a baby.Does it screw a kid up, to be an only child? The evidence is sparse and weighted oddly. For every thin study saying yes, there’s a companion one saying no. And if it does, then what? The answer can’t simply be to have more children. Even if the idea of choice was real and solid – rather than a melting Solero in our hand – to me the whole exercise stinks slightly. We bring ourselves up to believe that we are perfectible. That simply by eradicating sugar from our diet, or by altering the questions we ask of our partners, or upon cutting in a choppy bob, all fear and anxiety will float away. Similarly, we’re encouraged to follow marked paths in order to create this version of symmetrical perfection, in the sunken belief that there is one correct way for a family to look. I’m not worried that being an only child will screw our daughter up. I have every confidence we’ll manage that anyway, whatever shape our family takes.In a speech last week, Sophie Walker (the leader of the Women’s Equality party) pointed out a problem with many businesses half-hearted movements towards equal representation. ‘Women don’t need mentors to get ahead. Get mentors for the men who don’t think there is a problem.’I’m writing under the threat of rain and it occurs to me the perfect name for the next spate of severe weather.

In a preliminary ruling this week, Ofcom says it has “reasonable grounds to believe” that Virgin has contravened its general conditions which state companies cannot charge excessive fees that disincentivise customers from switching supplier.The company may also have fallen foul of Ofcom rules by failing to publish clear information on fees,\u0026nbspand by requiring customers who move home to sign a new fixed-term contract or face an early termination charge.“Having assessed all available evidence, we have reasonable grounds to believe Virgin Media has broken our rules,” says Ofcom. “Virgin Media now has an opportunity to formally respond to our provisional decision. We will take any further representations the company makes into account before our final ruling.”Ofcom launched its investigation in response to a high number of complaints about the cable giant.But the most contentious issue – early termination charges levied on those who move home but to an area not served by Virgin’s cable network so cannot get the service even if they wish to continue – is not yet covered by Ofcom’s rules.Earlier this year,  reported how 80-year-old Ann Squires was forced to pay £136.88 when she had to leave her home of 40 years and move to a flat three miles away.When she notified Virgin of her new address she was told that it could no longer provide a service and yet still demanded an early termination charge for cancelling her contract. It issued a default notice under the Consumer Credit Act when she challenged the fee.Numerous other customers have also been forced to pay up even though Virgin told them it could no longer provide a service.Surprisingly, Ofcom says: “The terms that require Virgin customers moving home outside of its network to pay early termination charges do not fall within Ofcom’s rules.“We are continuing to consider whether they raise concerns under general consumer law. We will provide an update on this aspect of its investigation in due course.”Virgin Media says: “We have received Ofcom’s provisional findings and we will now review them thoroughly. We make it clear to customers that early disconnection fees can apply and we also offer 30-day rolling contracts for those that do not want to sign up for a minimum period, such as 12 months, and need more flexibility.”This month Ofcom announced an investigation into the early termination fees charged by EE."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dff4e2637b3fbc3c776ee865f7ab8aa0a7c61aa/0_245_5713_3427/master/5713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6caa38c68ad8541d872cd63454510b","title":"doorstep lending crackdown payday loans financial conduct authority","story":"Financial Conduct Authority to take action after schemes continue to flourish despite cap on payday loansMeasures to clamp down on doorstep lending and rent-to-own schemes are expected to be unveiled this week following concerns that they are fuelling problem debt.The action comes after warnings that vulnerable people are at risk from the schemes, which have continued to flourish after a cap was placed on payday loans, popularised by lenders such as Wonga. The cap significantly reduced the cost to borrowers, but campaigners and regulators worry that people on low incomes are drawn into unsustainable debt by other types of lending.A major survey last year revealed that 3.1 million adults had one or more high-cost loans or had had one in the previous 12 months. People showing “characteristics of potential vulnerability” were twice as likely to have used high-cost credit as other UK adults. In 2016, 200,000 people took out a rent-to-own product and 400,000 had outstanding rent-to-own debt at the end of the year. Rent-to-own customers have annual incomes of around £16,100, which means they are not well-placed to deal with high-interest loans.Doorstep lending customers, also known as “home-collected credit”, have annual incomes of about £15,500. Their total outstanding debt more than doubled from £1,200 in November 2014 to £2,800 in November 2016, with a quarter of this in home-collected credit. In 2016, 700,000 people took out a home-collected credit loan and 1.6 million people had outstanding debt on these products at the end of the year.Rob Halfon, Tory MP for Harlow and former business minister, said he was concerned that “loan sharks and rent-to-own companies are getting their teeth into the most vulnerable”.“It’s outrageous that some of them will end up paying back double what they borrowed,” he said. “Capping these interest rates would leave hardworking people in Harlow and across the country safe in the knowledge that they’ll get a fair deal when they take out a loan.“The government has given the FCA the powers to bring in a cap to protect consumers from these companies. Now the FCA needs to side with consumers.”Rachel Reeves, Labour chair of the business select committee, said: “It is unacceptable that doorstep lenders and providers of rent-to-own goods are allowed to blatantly exploit people they know are vulnerable. By charging exorbitant interest rates and fees, they are only worsening people’s financial woes. The FCA needs to take urgent action to stop unscrupulous providers creating more misery.”Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “People who use rent-to-own and doorstep loans are woefully unprotected from runaway costs.“Our research shows a cap on these loans would save people £185m and help stop debts spiralling out of control. The payday loan cap has been a remarkable success and led to a dramatic reduction in the number of people we see with problem debts from these loans.“The regulator must not miss this opportunity to give people a necessary safety net and extend the cap to rent-to-own and doorstep loans.”An FCA spokesman said: “The FCA does not comment on speculation. The full document will be published on 31 May.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeeb92cbe0c9c1242c0aa9eeee63fcad83608f60/58_345_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373ec3d0384938e5c2f82d4fbb9cf159","title":"busking joins cashless society as musicians start using card readers","story":"London to introduce world’s first contactless payment scheme for street performersLondon is to introduce a contactless payment scheme for buskers in what organisers say is a world first.Busk in London, a Mayor of London initiative, has partnered with technology company iZettle to give card readers to performers.

The phenomenal rise of electronic dance music (EDM) may have entered a new, more mature phase, according to DJs and industry experts.An annual state-of-the industry report presented at the International Music Summit (IMS) in Ibiza last week, which examined everything from recorded music sales to DJ earnings, club and festival revenues and merchandising, suggests the industry is in rude health in Asia but is losing market share in the US and Europe.Kevin Watson, founder of Danceonomics, a knowledge hub for the electronic music industry, and the author of the report, said that, given such success, it was not surprising that appetite for the genre would eventually stall. “I think there’s still plenty of room for growth going forward. There’s been a slight dip but that’s to be expected, and the numbers still remain very positive on what the future looks like.”The rise of EDM has been powered by technology, with social media helping build the profiles of emerging artists such as the Belgian techno DJ Amelie Lens. It has also transformed the music distribution model.“Kids in their bedrooms can – pretty much for free – produce their own electronic music track and distribute it instantly,” Watson said. “And there’s lots of people out there that are now doing this and becoming very successful, because there are now almost zero investment costs.”Watson’s report will be seen in some quarters as confirmation that the long-predicted bursting of the EDM bubble has finally happened.But those within the industry suggest the picture is more nuanced. Pete Tong, the DJ and co-founder of the International Music Summit, told Music Week that the bubble had “punctured” rather than burst.“I guess another analogy would be: ‘The party’s over, it’s now time to really get your hands dirty, get back to work and look after this business you’ve built for this level and get it to the next phase’,” Tong said.Watson agreed, noting that as electronic music (he eschews the EDM label, arguing it has become synonymous with the commercial side of the genre) has teamed up with mainstream artists and festivals, its impact has become disguised. “You see a lot of tracks that are produced with DJs collaborating with other artists and a lot of those are being classified as pop or R\u0026ampB,” he said. “They’re not getting registered in electronic music’s share of sales. Another thing we’re seeing is a lot of mainstream festivals like Coachella, which we wouldn’t normally term electronic music festivals, are booking a lot of electronic music DJs and artists.”Recent examples of mainstream acts teaming up with EDM artists include Coldplay and the Chainsmokers, Justin Bieber’s work with Skrillex and Diplo and Ariana Grande’s collaboration with the DJ and producer Zedd.Conversely, as other music genres assimilate it, parts of the electronic music movement have gone more underground.“Quite often when things become much more populist and commercial, a lot of people become more focused on the underground, and that experiences a renaissance as well,” Watson said. “People might read about Coldplay and the Chainsmokers and the latest smash hit, but actually there’s a lot of stuff going on across the industry and there’s plenty of room for everyone to champion their particular sound.”Tom Faber, a DJ and music critic, predicts that the genre, whose roots lie in 1970s artists such as Kraftwerk and King Tubby, will continue to mutate. “Electronic music has been a thing over the last 40 years: it’s always going in and out of the mainstream. It’s one of the genres that’s always coming back. For me, electronic music is always looking forward, always doing something new.”For EDM’s superstar DJs, the industry continues to be a cash cow. Forbes estimates that Calvin Harris earned £37m last year while Tiesto took home £29m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0716b3186ac9da6045b9ab5d39709ef63ca57851/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0646b79e6407775b9f91e56e74060ba9","title":"nazanin zaghari ratcliffe to face new trial iran","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the detained British-Iranian aid worker sentenced to five years in jail in Iran, is reportedly to face a second trial on new security charges.

Full-priced tickets cost £35.Some insiders are worried that the party could be in for a seven-figure loss unless action is taken, though Labour officially denies such a loss is on the cards.

Yet strangely after three weeks of vicious riding, the last significant skirmish on the way to Cervinia saw barely a blow attempted – at least on the road.Off it, however, it was a different story. For while Froome was cheered on by the majority of the huge crowd, he was also reminded that not everyone believes in him as one spectator rushed out and spat at him three kilometres from the finish. Afterwards Froome said that he had not seen the incident. But his team-mate Wout Poels certainly did, looking around in understandable horror.Froome also faced more questions about his stunning solo victory on Friday – with one reporter asking whether, unlike other great performances in the past such as Floyd Landis at the 2006 Tour de France, it would stand the test of time.“I can understand the parallels and comparisons being drawn by some people,” he replied.“But I have every confidence it will stand.” He also said that, contrary to some reports, his race data from Friday’s stage – where he reckoned he rode an average of 350 watts for three hours – was available to race organisers.“I’d be very surprised if the data isn’t there,” he added. “I have been riding around with an extra 100 metregram receiver of theirs the last three weeks. I’d be disappointed if they don’t have the data.”Froome also pledged, yet again, that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing after being found with double the permitted levels of salbutamol in his system at the Vuelta last September – as first revealed by the . “I have a clear conscience,” he said. “When the time is right, all the information will be shared with everyone and I am sure people will see it from my point of view.”For now, though, Froome wants to purely focus on celebrating becoming the first man in 35 years to hold all three grand tours – the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and the Giro – at the same time, joining Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx in the pantheon.True, there is still one more stage remaining. But the 10 laps of 11.5km around Rome on Sunday evening will be largely processional. To Froome, each one will feel like a fresh victory parade.“It is a very special win,” said Froome. “I know it is not over until Rome but the battle is over now. But there were so many moments when it was extremely hard.”And while beaming from ear to ear, he admitted that there were times he didn’t think his fifth grand tour victory was on the cards.“Obviously the crash right before the prologue in Jerusalem really knocked my confidence, and I was in a lot of pain after that,” he said. “And there were also days where I should have finished in front and I didn’t and I lost time so there have been so many hurdles to overcome. And as we have seen from some, when you have a bad day in these last few days of the Giro you don’t just lose minutes, you can lose tens of minutes.“But my team-mates and the support staff believed in me. They said: ‘Wait, this race is brutal and you are going to get to the last few days and the race can really change.’ And it did.”That was evident on stage 20 as the Frenchman Thibaut Pinot, who started the day in third, lost a staggering 45 minutes – a similar amount that Simon Yates lost on Friday. Froome, however, never looked in any danger of letting slip the 40 seconds he had over his nearest challenger Tom Dumoulin.In theory, the 214km from Susa to Cervinia looked to possess sharp enough teeth to make Froome fear its bite. The final 90km had three climbs, each amounting to almost 20km in duration – with 4,000m of rise and fall along the way. Yet he was only rarely tested and never troubled. After three weeks where he had looked short of his best, Froome the Imperious was back.While the Spaniard Mikel Nieve pulled away on the final climb to celebrate his 34th birthday with a stage win, Froome focused purely on man-marking Dumoulin up the Col Tsecore and then the Col St-Pantaléon.Finally with six kilometres remaining on the road to Cervinia, Dumoulin went for it, attacking three times in rapid succession only to find Froome locked onto his wheel each time he looked over his shoulder. “I gave everything I had,” said Dumoulin. “He was too strong for me. I have no regrets.”Not only was it not enough, but Froome actually looked stronger than ever towards the finish. Indeed, as he made his way over the steepest stretch of the final climb, just before Valtournenche three kilometres out, he powered clear of Dumoulin in a defiant show of strength. As he did so he passed bunches of pink Giro d’Italia balloons, some of which had been popped.A few days ago, when he was fourth in the race and struggling with saddle sores, Froome had looked similarly deflated. But, once again, he and Team Sky somehow found the resolve to deliver when it mattered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c88a40baaafe69ac78bd56e5facc8aba9466b33/0_445_5330_3198/master/5330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a8c57c6c04b23dd1da31a55b255ef4","title":"daniel ricciardo takes monaco f1 pole from vettel with hamilton third","story":"Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo went into this weekend’s Monaco Grand Prix publicly seeking redemption for the team error that cost him an almost certain win here two years ago. His journey is not yet over and Monaco can bite in the most unforgiving fashion but with an absolutely emphatic pole position the Australian has given himself every chance finally to banish the bad memories.Ricciardo delivered pole, only the second of his career having started from the top spot in the ill-fated 2016 race, with an exemplary lap that topped a weekend where no one has been able to match him. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was in second and Lewis Hamilton, who leads the German by 17 points in the world championship, was in third.Ricciardo’s first hot lap in Q3 was a full four-tenths clear of his rivals. It was a masterclass in Monaco and, although he could not improve on his second run, he did not need to. Vettel could only close the deficit to two-tenths, with Hamilton four-tenths back. He topped every session in practice and qualifying and in doing so set a new track record on six occasions.While the Australian was pleased, he was aware there was work to be done. “The race is tomorrow and then we will celebrate,” he said. “There is still a lot of fire in this belly. I’ve done everything I can so far. Let’s finish the job tomorrow. I’m pumped.”After the session he was on the phone to Red Bull’s owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, who was doubtless as pleased at Ricciardo’s performance as he would have been disappointed at his team-mate Max Verstappen’s.For a driver with such promise, Verstappen’s record at Monaco is poor. Having crashed three times across three visits, he once again put his Red Bull in the wall in final practice, an incident almost identical to his accident in qualifying in 2016. The team had to replace the gearbox but were unable to do so in time for qualifying and he will start from the back of the grid.Verstappen has now been involved in incidents at all six races this season. He was defensive here but held his hands up to the error. “I got caught off guard by a slow car but that is no excuse,” he said. “I have to look to myself. I made the mistake myself.”Hamilton, meanwhile, had warned of Red Bull’s threat and was not overly surprised Mercedes were outpaced. He and the team were happy they had extracted all they could from the car. “We did the best we could the car wasn’t good enough,” he said. “I gave it everything I could but you can’t always get everything perfect. But the car is in one piece so we live to fight another day.”The race is likely to be a one-stop and Vettel acknowledged he had to make the most of the run to Sainte Dévote. “I would to like to jump Daniel at the start,” he said. “It is nearly impossible to overtake. The plan is to do a good start and keep the pressure on to the end.”Kimi Räikkönen was in fourth, with Valtteri Bottas in fifth. McLaren’s Fernando Alonso was in seventh place. The Force India’s of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in sixth and ninth respectively, with the Renault of Carlos Sainz in eighth and the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly in tenth.Romain Grosjean in the Haas was in 15th place but will take a three-place grid penalty after causing an accident at the last round in Spain. Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in 11th in front of the McLaren of Stoffel Vandoorne. Sergey Sirotkin in the Williams was in 13th, with Charles Leclerc’s Sauber in 14th.Brendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso was in 16th with Sauber’s Marcus Ericsson in 17th. Williams’ Lance Stroll was in 18th, in front of the Haas of Kevin Magnussen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b5007b6d49922e88421945f3bcabfe216f3904/13_0_2007_1204/master/2007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d9ca4d0f0504665c1d1fb5ded41599","title":"exeter saracens premiership play off final match report","story":"It was apt that Chris Wyles signed off his Saracens career with two tries after another final in which the team that had finished first came second. Exeter lacked the wiles of their opponents, sticking to the possession formula that has brought them so much reward this season without taking ownership of the game after the opening 10 minutes.Sarries did not touch the ball in that time, apart from Sean Maitland dropping Nic White’s box-kick, but it was the period when the match was won and lost. As Exeter took play through phase after phase, Saracens met them head-on, protecting the gainline by fanning out and rarely competing for possession at the breakdown to allow them to rush up.Exeter were being pushed backwards but kept coming, not tweaking their approach beyond the odd off-load. They had failed to beat Leinster in two attempts in the European Champions Cup in December and it is not so much that they lack a plan B but that their A game needs more variation, a kick here or there or a long pass to bring Henry Slade in from the\u0026nbspcold.They were predictable while Saracens had Alex Goode. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, was among the spectators, but he would not have been scrutinising a full-back he jettisoned two years ago. It was, though, Goode who, following Exeter’s early dominance, created the opening try after 13 minutes when chasing Owen Farrell’s chip and, with a mixture of determination and luck, beating four defenders to the ball. Saracens were able to run at a defence scrambling into position and – after moving the ball wide – they used their forwards to rumble to the line for Billy Vunipola to claim his first try of a season badly disrupted by injury.It was their first attack and the next one produced their second try with Goode again at its core.He appeared at second receiver outside Farrell and after taking the ball ran an outside arc that prevented the defence from fanning out wide. He timed his pass to Alex Lozowski and Wyles was left with a run-in on the left wing. The move was almost repeated in the final two minutes when Nathan Earle, Wyles’s replacement, completed the scoring and it was the ability of Saracens to work players into space rather than seek contact that set them apart.They did have one jittery period at the end of the third quarter when Exeter, having made a raft of changes, including their entire front row, stiffened up their scrum and used a penalty won up front to drive a line-out. When it was collapsed by Schalk Brits close to the Saracens line, the hooker, making his final appearance for the club at the age of 37, was sent to the sin-bin.Exeter – 19-3 down at that stage after Wyles’s second try six minutes into the second period – sensed the turning of the tide.Dave Ewers was held up over the line and from the resulting scrum, Gareth Steenson used the threat of Olly Woodburn outside him to dummy his way over, and the Chiefs’ supporters found their voice. The champions had won the final 10 matches of the season in all competitions while Sarries had overcome their worst run this decade when they lost seven consecutive matches in November and December.Saracens kept true to themselves in adversity and here, nine points ahead but with Brits having another seven minutes in the sin-bin, their season was on the line. The last year they had failed to win a trophy was 2014 and nothing was going to deflect them. Having 14 players was barely a disadvantage because Mako Vunipola, again, was playing with the force of two in his 32nd appearance of the season having started all three Lions Tests in New Zealand.Vunipola carried the ball for 38 metres, more than any other forward on a hot, humid afternoon, and he made 18 tackles while helping establish his side’s early superiority up front where he won two penalties out of Tomas Francis, a tight-head not often found in reverse gear. He was given the last five minutes off and had just enough strength to trudge off the field to a standing ovation.It was a match between two teams renowned for their collective strength, but a difference was the influence exerted by some of their noted iniduals, led by Mako Vunipola. Farrell, until he developed cramp, was excellent in defence, along with his captain Brad Barritt, Maro Itoje was at his marauding best and Jackson Wray timed his interventions at the breakdown.And there was Goode, the player Exeter could have done with. His England career is said to have fizzled out because of a lack of pace, but his speed of thought was such here that he was able to exploit a defence that was too often narrow. He would fix an opponent and manoeuvre a team-mate into space where the Chiefs tended to run at bodies.Saracens used to be regarded as roundheads. They have not gone all cavalier, but they have their moments, wily enough to regain the crown they lost in Exeter last year and they have the summer to figure out how to topple Leinster in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f41e0ae6cc877080eb08ceeb3b415429284f5086/0_78_3824_2295/master/3824.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829734572b16ecd7a6c69a961caa7b4b","title":"kyle edmund french open seeding unfazed","story":"The British No 1 is unfazed by the pressure of his strong position inside the top-16 seedings bubble and welcomes the test of his dangerous first-round opponent Alex de MinaurKyle Edmund, simultaneously handling hay fever and raised expectations, rubs his eyes occasionally while he surveys the opportunities opening up for him at Roland Garros over the next fortnight in the most open major for several years.He is inside the protective top-16 bubble in the seedings for the first time and, in the continued absence of Andy Murray, hardly needs reminding that a nation expects – perhaps too much. But it does not seem to faze him. He is the most sanguine of customers.While Edmund is up for it – if only he can shake the pollen from his nostrils – he is quick to identify his first opponent, the vibrant young Australian wildcard, Alex de Minaur, as a challenge every bit as dangerous as some he hopes to encounter deeper in the draw.After reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open the British No 1 has navigated a steeper climb in the rankings and in his personal ambitions. He might not put it in so many words, but winning here with the field in unfamiliar disarray would represent an obvious high-point in his young career, even if a rematch with his Melbourne conqueror, Marin Cilic, in the fourth round might be a more realistic target.“Guess there was expectation from the outside,” he says of his post-Australian development, in which he reached his first Tour final and has risen to No 17 in the world.“I always have expectations on myself to do well but, when you are going up the rankings and you start to play guys more often a lower rank than you, it’s just the way it works.”Echoing the sentiments of Johanna Konta about the women’s draw at majors, he adds: “A lot of players can beat players lower-ranked or higher-ranked these days. Sometimes it’s not too much of a surprise when that happens. The tour is pretty tough, not a lot of margins. The reason the guys are at the top is they consistently perform better each day in matches. But even the top guys, I’m pretty sure they know they have to be on it a lot of the time – and they are very good at doing that.”In this second phase of his career, Edmund says he has not changed his mindset or his preparation, but he knows it will never be the same for him as when learning his trade in less stressful circumstances against players some way removed from Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and his closer rival, the world No 3 Alexander Zverev, with whom he shared a fierce struggle in Rome last week.Late on Friday, Nadal learned he would begin the defence of his title against the 32-year-old Italian Simone Bolelli, a lucky loser drafted in to cover the late withdrawal of Alexandr Dolgopolov. Bolelli, ranked 130 in the world, has lost all of his five matches against the Spaniard, most recently in Madrid two years ago. Also called up is Ruben Bemelmans, in for Lu Yen-hsun against Yuki Bhambri, in the same quarter of the draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0caf4aa36f624622667fd42879ce3e4f52094f60/0_279_5499_3299/master/5499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6f469deb82eab66e22cb7331ada5c12","title":"the baroque delights of antwerp","story":"Historic Antwerp is opening its gilded stucco doors to lovers of Europe’s most decadent styleAntwerp was once the mighty cog that turned world trade. Sitting at the mouth of the River Scheldt, it dominated international 16th-century markets in sugar, spices and textiles. Today it is still an improbably cosmopolitan place for its size, but is better known for its international diamond business and, less alluringly, as the port that sucks in more cocaine than any other. It recently overtook London as cocaine capital of Europe.The city was also famed for its great Flemish art, from the huge religious panels of Rubens to the royal portraits by Van Dyck and all those detailed still life tables, laden with silverware, meat and fruit.In the past few years, the run of hit historical novels and dramas set in the dimly lit, 17th-century luxury of the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) has raised its profile, too. Mysterious romances, including The Girl with the Pearl Earring, Tulip Fever and The Miniaturist, have all helped to remind us how intriguing this moneyed part of northern Europe once was.Next weekend (1-3 June), Antwerp is to seize upon just one word to help it celebrate its creative history: baroque. These days it often implies something deemed too ornate, but four centuries ago the baroque movement swept in on a surge of Catholic decorative excess that has left a deep imprint on Antwerp’s architecture. “Antwerp Baroque 2018” will be exploring these themes in a series of art events around the city.Most visitors head for the famous Grote Markt – the main square in the old quarter – but I was just as bowled over by the carefully restored homes of a former 17th-century mayor, Nicolaas Rockox, and his neighbour, the painter Frans Snijders, both brimming with baroque self-confidence. Snijders was well known for painting snarling dogs, dead game carcasses and exotic birds.More squeamish tourists may want to focus on the ornate vases of flowers painted by Clara Peeters – a once-famous Flemish artist born at the turn of the 16th century who is only now being recognised again. (When Madrid’s Prado showed her work in 2016, she became the first female artist to have a solo exhibition there.)The baroque mood continues at full tilt inside the nearby church of St Charles Borromeo, packed with sweeping gestures and the theatricality of the age. If you have ever been underwhelmed in Britain by the pared-down aesthetic of a draughty church, then this house of prayer in Antwerp is the antidote. The carved woodwork of the pulpit and the sculpted Carrara marble in the chapels are a lesson in 17th-century bling.The big draw here though is Peter Paul Rubens’s panel Return of the Holy Family from Jerusalem which the church bought back at auction six years ago so that it could be returned to its position at the left of the altar, where the artist wanted it.A fluffy Belgian waffle, or perhaps a pint of blonde beer at Den Engel on the Grote Markt, is probably the right way to regain strength for the next leg of the baroque tour. It would be silly to leave out Rubens’s own home, which is being especially renovated for the summer. His imposing Italianate arch will soon be revealed in its original wonder. And his glamorous self-portrait, a kind of promotional calling card, is newly on display in pride of place, although it had to compete for public interest on the morning I was there with the Tintoretto that David Bowie owned. The most impressive show for Rubens fans, however, lies inside the cathedral that rises above the rest of the old city.For some baroque light refreshment try Elfde Gebod bar and café just next to the cathedral. The interior is awash with gilt and religious icons alongside an impressive range of Belgium beers.Beyond the city are the green spaces of Middelheim, a favourite of the old rich burghers of Antwerp who would come here to escape the crush of the port. Now it’s Europe’s first permanent sculpture garden set over 30 acres. With two large wooded areas separated by a road, it is dotted with famous forms, from a Henry Moore and a Barbara Hepworth, to Antony Gormley’s metallic astronomical web. Next month these sculptures will be joined by a new set of commissions dubbed “Experience Traps” as part of the festival.The ultimate antidote to a baroque-filled day is an evening meal in the restaurant RAS (restaurant on the stream), an airy, modern and minimalist interior on the riverbank, with views across the river through an expanse of floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The food is similarly pared back: a fine blend of nouvelle cuisine and traditional dishes.Walking back through the Grote Markt afterwards, I noticed that the Brabo fountain in the middle of the square features a man holding a severed hand in a grim reference to the myth of the giant who lopped off sailors’ hands and hurled them into the Scheldt. The story is also remembered in the shape of the chocolates and biscuits sold all over the city. Somehow it seems an essentially baroque detail. After all, the word baroque derives from the idea of an “imperfect pearl”: something lustrous with a beguiling flaw.Eurostar trains from London via Brussels to Antwerp’s baroque main station cost from £70 return.

Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names.

Her very first home was the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas the family home she left for university 18 years later was the White House. Ordinarily, it’s only young royals who grow up in lavish official residences and the pitiless media spotlight, a permanent presence in our consciousness. It is a uniquely strange and unenviable version of celebrity that stole Clinton’s anonymity before she was old enough to spell it.When we meet there is, therefore, a disconcerting sense of deja vu. Everything begins exactly as one might expect. On the previous day there had been the pre-interview call from one of her handlers, who was ostensibly warm and yet conveyed an impression of wary control, leaving me worried about how far I’d be allowed to stray from the subject of Clinton’s new book. The interview takes place at the Clinton Foundation, a vast but discreetly unadvertised expanse of midtown Manhattan office space populated by serious-looking people and elegantly adorned by African-inspired artwork chosen by Clinton’s father. Clinton is waiting in the glass boardroom the interview starts precisely on schedule, to the second.The 38-year-old displays impressive fluency in British current affairs, knowing all about the NHS’s missed mammogram test results, and praising David Lammy’s recent Windrush speech in the Commons. Her father once talked about the importance of really seeing people – the person who opens his car door, or pours his coffee – and I’m struck that Clinton notices the medical support sleeve I’m wearing, and asks about the origins of the name Decca. But any impression of intimacy is offset by a facial expression that remains glassily still, and a voice that never modulates. Clinton has inherited her mother’s unnerving composure, and speaks in monotone paragraphs consisting almost entirely of language no human being I know ever uses. “The choices that they made,” for example, “were fundamental to me feeling affirmed in charting my own journey”, which is not how anyone else talks about their mum and dad.Clinton has just published her third children’s book, and will be appearing at the Hay festival next weekend. She Persisted Around The World is a picture book in which she tells the stories of 13 extraordinary women through the ages, from Marie Curie to Malala Yousafzai, who persevered in the face of prejudice and changed history. It’s the sequel to her New York Times bestseller She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World, the title inspired by Republican senator Mitch McConnell’s scathing attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren for trying to read aloud a letter from Martin Luther King Jr’s widow in the senate. Warren was famously silenced, under an obscure senate rule that McConnell later defended with: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” only for his words to be swiftly converted into a feminist rallying cry.Clinton is completely right, of course. But later, listening back to my tape, I notice that when I say it feels important to me for my sons to know these stories, she responds with: “Thank you for framing it around both our daughters and our sons.” A few minutes later, when I tell her I took them to see Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle In Time, which features a geeky female protagonist who’s good at maths, Clinton replies: “I’m really grateful that you took your sons to see it.” Her odd construction of gratitude (most people would say, “Oh, well done,” or “That’s great!”) means that – even when we’re agreeing – it can feel hard to connect.She has talked in the past about inheriting her maternal grandmother’s “responsibility gene”, and mentions to me that her daughter’s nursery has been encouraging conversations about the concept of fairness. “It gives us the chance to talk with her about what is fair, and that she already has unfair advantages because of who her parents are. I don’t think she really understands the concept of privilege yet, but I want her to be able to understand that as soon as she’s old enough to. So we can start having larger conversations about privilege, and about the clear responsibility that comes with privilege. It’s also about kindness and respect.”My guess is that Clinton feels unable to say something as simple as “Oh, well done”, for fear of sounding superior. The unfortunate irony is that her thanks, intended to convey humility, end up making her seem either inauthentic or grand.It’s just a tiny glimpse into the lifelong impossibility of being Chelsea Clinton. At elementary school in Arkansas, her teacher called her precocious – “and it wasn’t meant as a compliment” – though her parents told her it was “a very good thing”. She’d begun reading newspapers when she was just four, “and my parents expected me to have an opinion about what I thought the most important stories were, and then to be able to muster an argument in support of what I thought was right or wrong. They taught me early on the difference between opinion and fact. A crucial distinction,” she adds dryly, “that seems to be not as appreciated at the moment by some, unfortunately.”Just 12 when she moved into the White House, an awkward adolescent jumble of frizzy hair and braces, Clinton was 18 when the father she idolised confessed to an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Two hundred and fifty journalists covered her arrival at Stanford University, where she was criticised for keeping a low profile, hidden away in her bulletproof dorm, but then criticised again for partying with celebrities when she moved to Oxford for an MPhil in international relations. She tried working for management consultants McKinsey, and then a hedge fund, but her heart wasn’t in it as she has said, “I tried to care about things like money. I just didn’t.”Following another master’s in public health she became a special correspondent for NBC, but was widely panned, one critic describing the decision to hire her as “journalistically bankrupt”. New York magazine ran the headline: “Chelsea Clinton at NBC: When Nepotism Goes Wrong”.The caution with which she parses my questions is therefore unsurprising. Now vice-chair of the family foundation, she seems to have found a public voice and role that fits, campaigning for girls’ empowerment, early access to childhood education and global healthcare initiatives – but even so, for the first half of the interview she sounds more like a policy paper than a real person.And then, quite unexpectedly, something changes. Feminist opinion is ided, I observe, between women who feel we should seize this #MeToo moment and go all out to tear down the patriarchy, and those who fear our rage will alienate support. Does Clinton still believe we should go high? She gazes at me in silence, as though making up her mind whether or not to become present, and when she opens her mouth it feels as if she is suddenly here.“For me, maybe because I’ve had so much vitriol flung at me for as long as I can literally remember, people saying awful things to me even as a child, I’ve never found it productive, personally, to engage in that way. To retaliate with crass language or insult someone personally – I just don’t think I’m built that way.”Does she tell herself they’re not really talking about her? “Oh, no,” she flashes back, with a low chuckle. “I know they’re talking about me. I just think that the way they’re talking about me, to me, to my face, online, is a reflection on them and not about me. The savagery that is directed at me, sometimes it’s because I’m just the person that they happen to see and recognise, and they’re angry, and so that anger kind of spills out. Sometimes they’re mad at me because of something that my mum or dad did, or something that my mum or dad never did – but they have been fed the narrative that they were trafficking children, or drugs, or some other heinous crime.”She used to believe the right thing to do about “all of the meanness” was simply ignore it, she reflects. “Now I’ve come to feel differently, because I think that the way that our president and many people around him have not only mainstreamed hate, but mainlined it, is so deeply dangerous.” Her eyes fill with dismay as she cites the rising reports of bullying in schools catalogued by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. “Not just the hundreds but now thousands of instances in schools across America, where children are citing the president as they’re demeaning a little girl, or they’re chanting ‘Build a wall’ in an attempt to demean and degrade brown children. So the reason, now, I no longer ignore it when people say hateful things to me on the street or on social media is, I think we have to shine a light. I think those of us who have platforms to do that have to say this is wrong and unacceptable, so we don’t normalise it but try to detoxify what has been unleashed. Because if we don’t, we leave a vacuum. And I think the darkness fills that vacuum.”I tell her a lot of people in Britain are wondering how they should receive Trump’s visit in July. What’s her advice? “Well, I’ve been to multiple protests since the election. Charlotte’s been to at least three, maybe four. Aidan’s been to one. If I lived in Britain I would show up to protest, because I don’t agree with what he’s doing to degrade what it means to be an American.”We are meeting two days after a smiling Ivanka Trump opened the US embassy in Jerusalem, as dozens of Palestinians were massacred. I ask if Clinton feels any sympathy for the first daughter, obliged to do her father’s grotesque bidding, or considers her complicit. Her expression hardens.“She’s an adult. She can make the choices for herself. I mean, she’s 36. We are responsible for our choices. In 2008 I was really proud to support my mum – but I disagreed with her fundamentally on a few things, particularly her then opposition to equal marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans. I never defended that position, because it wasn’t what I believed was the right thing to do.”Ivanka and Chelsea used to be friends, and seemed to have much in common: famous and powerful parents young families and busy jobs in Manhattan. In 2015 Clinton told American Vogue, “She’s always aware of everyone around her and ensuring that everyone is enjoying the moment. It’s an awareness that in some ways reminds me of my dad, and his ability to increase the joy of the room. There’s nothing skin-deep about Ivanka.” The friendship somehow survived the election campaign, but not Trump’s presidency the pair haven’t formally fallen out, but Clinton says they haven’t spoken in “a long time”.Were Ivanka to succeed her father in the White House, as some have speculated, would the election of the first female president still constitute a triumph for feminism? “Well, I didn’t support Sarah Palin when she was the vice-president nominee in 2008. And I hope my son is as much a feminist as my daughter. I think it is more about what we stand for, and how we do it, than the gender of the person there.” With the exception of Barron – “He’s 12 let him be 12, please” – she has no sympathy whatsoever for Trump’s children. “They’re adults who’ve made the decision to work in this administration.” Had her mother been elected, she says she would never have gone to work for her, so I ask if she shares others’ distaste at Trump employing his family.“I think the president should be able to hire whoever he or she thinks are best qualified. I do not believe that many of the people that he has hired have been qualified to do the jobs. Not only do I want an administration that isn’t venal, corrupt and focused on making life harder for millions of Americans, I also want a competent administration. So for me, the larger question is the collision of cruelty and incompetence and corruption that we see across the administration.”Given her father’s track record, I’m curious to know how she would feel if Stormy Daniels were to take down the presidency. “I haven’t followed that as closely as I have everything that’s emerging around the Russia investigation. But I do think it’s important that no one is above the law, and so whatever investigations come out of what Mueller’s doing, or the other ways in which many people are attempting to hold the president accountable, I think it’s important that those continue.” Following the scenes in Charlottesville last summer, she must have considered the danger of violence if Trump’s supporters feel he is unduly hounded out of office. The spectacle of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen marching through the Virginia town last August, bearing torches and swastikas, sent shockwaves through America and cost one counter-protester her life. When Trump declared there were “fine people” marching on the Unite The Right rally, to many frightened Americans the nation’s politics felt profoundly and ominously altered. Just how febrile does Clinton consider the situation? She looks grave. “Quite, I think.”Her assistant announces that our time is up, and I turn my recorder off, but Clinton tells me to turn it back on. Now that she’s really here, she wants to keep talking.Since Barbara Bush died, she says, she’s thought a lot about the importance of intentions. “I disagreed with her husband on so much, and with her on so much. But I also never doubted that she believed what she and her husband were fighting for was going to be to the benefit of most Americans. She really believed that what they were doing was the right thing to do.“I used to believe all that mattered was the bottom line of the outcome, like, how many lives were improved, how many people were saved, how many more people got to go to school without debt, how many people had healthcare, how many women got to have paid maternity leave. I still believe that is what matters most. But I also now believe that intentions and tone and decency matter, because I think the wreckage that we’re seeing at this moment is one that will, I hope, be repaired on the policy standpoint when we elect Democrats. But I think we will still then have work to do on repairing the tone in our country, the exposure of the real racist and sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and antisemitic feeling which is on the rise in our country – a rot that has been exposed.”We are well over time now, and I glance at her assistant, but Clinton hasn’t finished. “I think one of the big mistakes,” she continues, “was, for so long, we focused on tolerance, which I just think is insufficient. People tolerated casual misogyny, but casual misogyny is maybe the gateway drug. We have freedom of speech, which I do think is hugely important – and yet people thought you couldn’t dispute hateful things, because they’re like – well, it’s freedom of speech. Well, freedom of speech doesn’t mean there is freedom of consequences.“Sure, you should not be in prison because you said something racist. But you also shouldn’t be able to run for president. And yet here we are.”She Persisted Around The World, published by Philomel Books, is available at the  bookshop for £9.99 (discounted from £12.99).

Stamina was “effective” and deserved further research, the party claimed in a press release at the time, because “citizens” believed that it was. Beppe Grillo, one of the Five Star Movement (M5S) founders, who has also supported unproven cures for cancer, used his popular blog to support pro-Stamina protests.In fact, Stamina was later proved to be a con, and the psychologist behind the treatment, Davide Vannoni, was convicted of conspiracy and fraud.The controversy came under fresh scrutiny last week after Conte, the family’s lawyer who supported Stamina, was plucked out of obscurity and named as Italy’s next prime minister by a new coalition government led by Five Star, now Italy’s largest party, and the far-right League.Conte was chosen, despite his lack of any political experience, by two leaders – Luigi Di Maio of Five Star and Matteo Salvini of the League – because they could not agree on anyone else. Hours after Conte got the green light to form a government, chaos ensued. The two parties have been squabbling over who to put in the cabinet. One of the people Conte wishes to appoint is Paolo Savona, his proposed finance minister, a vociferous critic of the euro, which he has called a “German cage”. But that choice is being resisted by the president, Sergio Mattarella.The development roiled Italian markets on Friday and has deeply worried Brussels, in large part because one of the few things Five Star and the League agree on is their distrust of the EU.The wrangling appears to be centred on a disagreement on just how Eurosceptic the new government ought to be. “There is an institutional grammar that has to be rewritten,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian at Luiss University in Rome. “This conflict is something we might have expected, because President Mattarella – installed by the former prime minister, Matteo Renzi – belongs to the old majority and the populists are impatient when it comes to checks and balances dictated by the Italian constitution.”The two populist parties cobbled together a coalition following an election on 4 March that resulted in a hung parliament. It plans to raise spending, slash taxes and possibly install a finance minister who believes that Italy’s entry into the eurozone was a “historical mistake”. Beyond the question of what this means for Italy and the EU, the parties’ rise to power could have a profound impact on Italy’s institutions, which have already come under attack. The Stamina episode gives a hint of what Italians – and the world – might expect.The League was in a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi from 1994, but under a different leadership. Five Star has never been in government. They both have a long history of embracing the unorthodox, supporting conspiracy theories, and challenging institutions that have traditionally been seen as the bedrock of Italian society. Now, after years of serving as parties of “no” against the former centre-left government, Five Star and the League are in charge.Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister who now serves as a senator for a party that supports the EU and defends the rights of migrants, told the Observer that there were plenty of elements of the parties’ joint agenda to be frightened of, especially policies against migrants. But she also noted their resistance to political norms.“They consider the institutions to be their property. I think that this is the basic problem,” said Bonino. Asked about the Stamina episode and the parties’ criticism of mandatory vaccinations, she added: “The anti-scientific mood is very big.”When Mattarella failed to immediately give his blessing to Conte’s nomination as prime minister, in part because questions had arisen about whether the law professor had padded his academic credentials, the move was immediately lambasted by a senior Five Star official, Alessandro Di\u0026nbspBattista.On Facebook, Di Battista warned Mattarella against serving as a “lawyer for those who oppose change” and on Twitter, he called on supporters to back Conte and put pressure on the president, who is rarely criticised by political leaders and is meant to be politically neutral.Di Battista’s father also took to social media and, in an attention-grabbing post, warned that if people got angry “the palace of President Mattarella may become like the\u0026nbspBastille”.In the run-up to the vote on 4\u0026nbspMarch analysts noted that in some ways both Five Star and the League – formerly the secessionist and xenophobic Northern League – sought to appear more mainstream in some of their views. For example, while both parties have been extremely critical of mandatory vaccinations, both sought to play down this position, despite Five Star holding rallies in the past that called on all parents to have a choice in whether their children be\u0026nbspvaccinated.Jacopo Iacoboni, a journalist at La Stampa who has closely followed Five Star, said that Di Maio had begun to present himself as being more moderate, but that he believed the populists were still wedded to their unorthodox theories, in part because it has been a strong draw for voters.“It has been a useful way for Five Star to attack any established expertise,” Iacoboni said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/404a3f06163275ce1ff22f3f15e3ee9b65ebe87e/0_98_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c85933c218893d9a0dc56e807660d5f","title":"clarke gayford jacinda ardern new zealand","story":"The TV host and partner of Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, gets ready to become a stay-at-home dad On Friday, in the freezing pre-dawn, as wild winter rainstorms battered Auckland, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, got up to catch a plane. She was heading to Taranaki, the energy-rich province on the North Island, to defend her government’s decision to ban future offshore oil and gas exploration. Earlier in the week she had faced up to farmers about the spread of the cattle disease Mycoplasma bovis and sanctioned her transport minister, who had unlawfully used a mobile phone on a plane.At the end of the week, weary from the ear-bashing from oil bosses and the realities of late-stage pregnancy, she headed home to the unassuming bungalow on a quiet street she shares with her partner, fishing show host Clarke Gayford.Because it’s Friday, the cabinet papers are waiting for her, and she’ll probably work on them until about 10.30pm. “Not an abnormal day,” says Gayford. That morning at 5am they had groggily discussed what she might want to eat for dinner. What could the“first bloke” of New Zealand cook for the future mother of the nation? Meatballs, she said. So Gayford, an enthusiastic if not expert cook, is on the hunt for a tasty meatball recipe.Less than a month away from the birth – which will make Ardern the first serving head of government since Benazir Bhutto to have a baby – Gayford, who will be a stay-at-home dad, is as ready as you can be. A room has been prepared, piles of baby “accoutrements” bought, and parenting advice has been accepted from Barack Obama (don’t panic it’s OK to make mistakes). “How can you prepare?” he says in the thoughtfully decorated, cosy home. They’ve installed central heating since buying it a few months ago because Ardern is no fan of the cold.Gayford, a radio and TV broadcaster, has thicker skin. It’s less than a month since malicious rumours about his personal life reached such a fever pitch that the police issued an unprecedented statement clearing him of any wrongdoing. What was it like to be smeared?“If I talk about it now, it just pours more petrol on it,” he says. But the instinct to watch his behaviour, already instilled by a life in the media, have been sharpened since meeting Ardern four years ago. While he’s had to rein in his enthusiasm for “a good rant on Facebook” – and has felt “like a right chump” editing his own Wikipedia page because the fake news that he was once a police cadet kept coming up in interviews – he keeps coming back to the “higher cause” of social justice and environmental action he sees Ardern getting on with.Even so, recent weeks have been quite an eye-opener for the fishing-mad boy from sleepy Gisborne. Accompanying Ardern on a trip to Europe that took in the Commonwealth heads of government meetings, he felt right at home with the royal family: “Jacinda was given probably one of the longer audiences with Camilla and Charles.” The heir to the throne wanted to chat about fishing and advocacy groups. At dinner, Ardern exchanged notes on parenting with Prince William, while Gayford was next to “hilarious” Princess Anne.He’s lucky that he gets to dip in and out of the “surreal” part of his partner’s job. With time to spare recently he felt the need to “reset”, so jumped in his old ute and drove to Gisborne to see a mate who “literally lives in the bush” and spent a couple of days out on the water.It may be a while till the next reset. Ardern plans to return to work six weeks after her due date, 17 June, relieving deputy PM Winston Peters, and Gayford will be at home with the baby. “It’s going to be quite a bit different, isn’t it?” How does he function on little sleep? “I’m hoping my years of DJing will pay off.”His parenting role models are his sisters – one who has three boys under four, the other two young girls. “I’m in their world a lot. You get a warts-and-all commentary. And my parents, of course.” His farmer father introduced him to the outdoors, fishing, surfing. He’s also had lots of stay-at-home dads coming up to him. “It’s all completely normal for them.”He will be back working himself soon. The third season of his TV show, Fish of the Day, which travels the Pacific in search of impressive catches and a fine meal, is due to be produced next summer, though this will, of course, depend on baby. Gayford will have to be even more regimented, he accepts, and parents will have to be called on for favours. The couple will have to travel a lot, and he will probably move to Wellington for a while with the child.Gayford made headlines again earlier this month when he posted a picture of himself on Twitter fending off a shark. Will he still be fighting off bronze whalers once the baby arrives? He’s actually quite cautious, he says, and has stopped pushing himself so much after having a blackout in the water. But there’s a plus to being next to a frightening sea creature: “It’s those moments that make you feel truly alive.”The world will want to see the child, so how will they balance the public interest and their own privacy? They haven’t had a proper discussion yet, but he’s optimistic that interest will taper off: “At the end of the day, we’re just New Zealanders. We all know each other. Life still goes on as per normal.”The couple say there will be no full-time nanny, but in this green-minded household – an electric car is charging in the driveway and he hasn’t used a plastic bag this year – the question of cloth nappies or disposables is proving a tricky one. It’s hard to find reusables for newborns, he says, but they’ll do their best.They have kept the sex of the child to themselves, though Radio NZ suggested that Clarke had said he was keen to meet “her”. What kind of child do they expect? “With each trip to your scans, where you see a little face developing, you start to think about all the projections you have on them as a person.”Have they thought about what their child will inherit? “There’s a strong line of Gayford noses.” And temperament? He’s read how an expectant mother “should be calm and clearheaded with thoughts of bunnies and fields” as he watches his partner in robust parliamentary debate. “I’m hoping the child picks up some of mum’s temperament.”Childhood Raised on a farm, eldest of three.

This made Israel the UK’s eighth largest market for UK arms companies, a huge increase on the previous year’s figure of £86m, itself a substantial rise on the £20m worth of arms licensed in 2015. In total, over the past five years, Israel has bought more than £350m worth of UK military hardware.Licences issued to UK defence contractors exporting to Israel last year include those for targeting equipment, small arms ammunition, missiles, weapon sights and sniper rifles. In 2016 the UK issued licences for anti-armour ammunition, gun mountings, components for air-to-air missiles, targeting equipment, components for assault rifles, components for grenade-launchers and anti-riot shields.Human rights groups have questioned the wisdom of sending a senior royal to a country whose use of lethal force last month has been the subject of concern from the UK\u0026nbspgovernment.“After the appallingly excessive response of the Israeli security forces at the Gaza border, tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories are likely to be close to boiling point when Prince William makes this historic visit,” said Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended Israel’s response, saying “every country has an obligation to defend its borders”. But Theresa May backed calls for an independent inquiry into the violence, which reportedly left 58 Palestinians dead. The British prime minister said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was “deeply troubling” and called for greater restraint. Now the UK government faces questions as to whether UK-made weapons were used by the Israelis last month.A review by government found the UK had issued 12 licences for arms it believed were likely to have been used in the 2014 war. In 2010 the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Israeli equipment used in an attack on Gaza “almost certainly” contained British-supplied components.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “The shootings we have seen over recent weeks have been an awful reminder of the appalling collective punishment and oppression that has been inflicted on the people of Gaza. By the government’s own admission, UK arms have been used time and again against Palestinians. Yet the arms sales have continued unabated. There must be a full investigation into if any UK arms have been used in the atrocities we have seen over recent months.”The Duke of Cambridge’s five-day trip will begin in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday 24 June, take in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority’s capital city, and end in Jerusalem. Netanyahu has said it will be “a historic visit, the first of its kind”.But Smith said it was taking place against the “backdrop of a massacre”. He added: “If the prince does not speak out against the violence that has been inflicted, then it will be regarded as a major political endorsement. He must not use his visit to whitewash or legitimise these terrible abuses.”Moscogiuri said: “When he’s in Ramallah, we’d like to see Prince William going beyond the usual royal meet-and-greet by spending time talking with some of the Palestinian communities who’ve been affected by Israel’s 51-year occupation. Like everyone in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, people in Ramallah have endured years of discriminatory restrictions on their movement, with roadblocks, militarised checkpoints and off-limits roads which are for the exclusive use of those in the illegal Israeli settlements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a21a7dd9bb8b6312d3bfe770168391870e794c/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f89a12c88d46810d6319b859851fe82","title":"egypt blocks youtube over film denigrating prophet muhammad","story":"Court ruling ends years-long appeals process over film that sparked deadly anti-US riotsEgypt’s top administrative court ordered authorities to block video-sharing website YouTube for a month over a film denigrating Islam’s prophet Muhammad.

The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, shows how close the two leaders have become in a short period of time. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage a 12 June summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore after Trump abruptly cancelled the meeting on Thursday.But on Saturday evening in the US as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested the US-North Korea summit could go ahead as originally planned.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”, Moon said. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on the specifics of how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if they would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities. The thorny issue of how exactly the North would give up its nuclear weapons has consistently hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before concessions are granted on economic sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression, while Pyongyang prefers a phased negotiations and concessions from the US. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But she warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a US-North Korea summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” Town said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one,” Moon said. But he added, “I’m sure we will succeed”.Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which ended in an armistice rather than a full peace treaty. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of the country’s nuclear test site this week.The two sides would hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions to reduce tensions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134b02a2860ea8c715a3572a5b880eba53391a75/274_182_3624_2175/master/3624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50b32659d73fc959013b84511f8e0c","title":"pakistan election date nawaz sharif imran khan","story":"Election to pit ruling PML-N party against that of former cricket star Imran KhanPakistan will hold a general election on 25 July in what could be only the second democratic transfer of power in the nuclear-armed country’s history.The election is expected to pit the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party against former cricket star Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.Khan’s party vowed Sunday to oust the country’s “corrupt” rulers. “The Pakistani nation ... can see the dawn of a new Pakistan, which will not be ruled by the corrupt,” PTI said in a statement posted on Twitter along with a graphic that read “Mafia’s Game Over”.“Stop us if you can,” it said in another tweet.Turmoil continues to rock the country after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was ousted by the supreme court in July 2017 on corruption charges and later barred from politics for life.Sharif was the 15th prime minister in Pakistan’s seven-decade history – roughly half of it under military rule – to be removed before completing a full term. After Sharif was ousted, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi took over the premiership.Pakistan completed its first ever democratic transfer of power after elections in 2013, when PML-N took over from the Pakistan People’s party following a landslide victory.“This is the second consecutive parliament to complete its tenure and we are now looking forward to go to the people to get their verdict on our performance,” the finance minister, Miftah Ismail, said.While PTI is vowing to clean up the country’s rampant corruption, and invest in education and healthcare, PML-N continues to boast of its investment in the country’s rickety infrastructure and courting billions of dollars in Chinese investment.Since he was ousted, Sharif and PML-N have become increasingly vocal in their confrontation with the country’s military establishment and courts, claiming they are victims of a conspiracy. Despite the numerous court rulings against PML-N, the party has won a string of recent byelections. It continues to enjoy significant support in the country’s most populous Punjab province, but will enter the election under increasing pressure.In April, a Pakistan court disqualified the foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, for violating the country’s election laws, while the interior minister, Ahsan Iqbal, was shot in the arm in a suspected assassination attempt in early May by an Islamist gunman. Sharif also sparked a firestorm earlier this month after suggesting Pakistani militants were behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, approaching what is seen as a red line in the country by touching on criticism of Pakistan’s armed forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507678.1527192306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish backstop provisions cannot be used for britain says eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May:  “The UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK,”  a senior EU official said. Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508852.1527281263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord yes yes yes a resounding emphatic yes","story":"Voters arrive at Dublin Castle where the official abortion referendum results will be announced later today. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina casting their votes in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment at St Mary’s Hospital in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Yes, Yes, Yes. A resounding, emphatic Yes. And what a way to say it – the only way to say it: with conviction and clarity. This massive vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution leaves no doubt. The Irish people have taken ownership of their abortion issue. They have taken it out of the hands of unrepresentative lobby groups and celibate clerics and decided how they want to approach it.On Friday, with steely assurance, a new generation of all the generations faced down the suffocating old certainties and swept them aside. On Friday, May 25th, 2018, they stood up and were not afraid to be counted. Because those days are gone now.The official result has yet to be declared, but the exit polls point only in one direction, and it is going to be a monumental change and a major milestone in modern Irish history.You could feel it in the air in the last week of the referendum campaign. Something had changed and something big was about to happen. It was there in the faces of the younger people – out there agitating, unashamed to be seeking basic rights for Irish women, because they were in the right.It was there in the noncommittal comments of older men and women. People misinterpreted them as the words of No voters who didn’t fancy being ridiculed for bucking a liberal trend. Instead, they were merely keeping their counsel and waiting to have their say.Thirty-five years is a long time to wait for a isive and dangerous clause to be excised from the Constitution. But for those who waited decades to see those lines equating the life of a foetus from conception to its living, breathing mother, the 15 hours it would take for the nation to vote probably felt like a lifetime.There couldn’t have been a better day for a vote. The sun shone on the island, welcoming back the thousands of men and women who traversed the globe and returned to vote. The sight of them arriving at ports and airports with their “Repeal” jumpers and wheelie cases moved the most hard-hearted observers to tears.These were the children of the women who had no choice, returning home from far-flung places and bringing back the gift of choice.All day, up and down the country, the voters streamed into polling stations, exceeding turnout expectations from early morning. The huge number of young people, young women in particular, many with babies and toddlers, did the heart good. You could sense the mood of charge in their faces as they came into the polling stations, anxiously scanning the tables, eager to hand over their cards.“I was torn, but I voted for my daughters,” said one woman.“We were only exporting the problem,” said her husband.The Taoiseach voted in his local school in Castleknock. Scoil Thomáis was swarming with photographers when Leo Varadkar arrived.He said he was confident.“The lads at my gym all told me they are voting Yes.”Many more were in rural locations around the State. These were the men and women from the big international photo agencies, hoping to capture the image of Catholic Ireland voting away the vestiges of church authority from their private lives.The presiding officer in Knock had to tell them to leave. With its shrine and place as the pilgrimage capital of Ireland, they descended on the Mayo village in the search of voting nuns, but they were unsuccessful. They had been told there was a big mural of the Blessed Virgin in Knock, but that has been painted over. They were most annoyed.If the smiling women and the reticent men and the huge numbers voting in Dublin and other major urban areas was an indicator of rapidly gathering change, there were worries in more rural areas.“The voting is very brisk, but everyone is very elderly. I think they’re being bussed in. I’d be worried,” said an acquaintance in Roscommon.But everywhere the change was happening.As the day wore on, and the figures climbed, the staying hand of pious history was always there in the background. There have been disappointments before. Powerful interests who exert huge influence in Irish political and social life were not going to lightly give up the fight.In the headquarters of Together for\u0026nbspYes, they had run out of posters and people were offering to walk the city streets wearing sandwich boards. Minister for Health Simon Harris called in to see them for the first time.Artwork along one wall of their offices – quieter than ever they have been in the last three months – had a quote from WB Yeats: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”Education is the enemy of those who would work to keep Irish men and women slaves to a dark past.The volunteers were optimistic, and a little teary. But, sure, who wasn’t.They recounted trips to the airport to welcome those who were home to vote. One overseas camera crew was trying to find a No\u0026nbspvoter to balance their report. They couldn’t, until somebody noticed a plane from Medjugorje was due in.They waited for the passengers to come through and finally came up with three people who would be voting No.Yes, the signs were there. Driving into town, groups of volunteers gathered on roundabouts were being cheered and beeped by passing motorists. Joggers gave the thumbs-up. But on a flyover, a group of anti-abortion campaigners were getting nothing from the cars travelling below.The Taoiseach wore his little Yes\u0026nbspbadge on his lapel. He said in the Dáil during the week that if there is a vote for repeal “Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate.”And some who have been around since 1983 will be a little bit more emotional.\u0026nbspOur morning started with a trip to the Phoenix Park to see Michael D Higgins vote.\u0026nbspThe then senator Michael D was fiercely opposed to the “callous” referendum on the Eighth Amendment in 1983, when he was president of the Labour Party.\u0026nbspHe said the TDs promoting it were “monumental in their hypocrisy”, and then quoted Michael Davitt: “If the Irish had a weakness worse than drink, it was moral cowardice.” Not any more.\u0026nbspAfter he voted, he got into his car and prepared to leave. Then he saw me and got out again, striding over to say hello. We shook hands and there was a little embrace and kiss from Sabina.I told him it was all getting a little too much and I was so glad to see him.\u0026nbspThe President said he misses meeting a lot of people he used to see.\u0026nbspI mentioned that 1983 speech and all the things he said and wrote back then. He was, of course, right.\u0026nbspMichael D smiled and said softly “I’m above all that now.”But I swear, I know it, there were tears in his eyes.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3509904.1527345046!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"una mullally referendum shows us there is no middle ireland just ireland","story":"Early tallies indicate that the exit polls are accurate and a strong Yes vote will win the referendum. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Supporters gather at Dublin Castle to await the final results of the referendum to repeal the Eighth  amendment. Photograph:   Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesThe handover period is over. The fiction of Ireland as a conservative, dogmatically Catholic country has been shattered. The past is left back there, and a new legacy is being created. A legacy of compassion, empathy, and maturity - a country taking responsibility for the care and health of women and girls. What happened in the referendum vote was seismic, but more seismic still was the realisation that this vote was reflecting change, not just instigating it. “They listened to us. They actually listened to us,” a young woman said to me, crying, in the RDS on Saturday morning.Together For Yes ran an excellent campaign, from start to finish. As the No campaign scraped the barrel, the Yes campaign always acted with dignity, with facts to the fore, and never once stooped. Together For Yes built an army around the country. An army of Us. In the RDS, people burst into tears when the Together For Yes bosses came into the room.For many, Ailbhe Smyth’s determination and calmness has been a source of great inspiration for decades. During the campaign she wore herself down so much that she struggled to walk in the final days. Meanwhile, female journalists from competing newspapers hugged each other when they spotted one another. Mary Lou McDonald was cheered by Labour party members, Simon Harris was cheered by people from Sinn Féin. This was a feminist movement non-partisan, grassroots, non-hierarchical where possible. We were all Together For Yes. There are thousands of stories from this referendum. It would be impossible for the media to catch them all, but the profound misunderstanding of this as a movement is notable for both media and politicians. There was, and remains, justified discontent amongst Yes campaigners, canvassers, and supporters, about how various sectors of the media patronised this long-standing, hugely significant movement, and viewed the issue though a conservative, party-political-focussed, and it has to be said, male, lens. In April, a senior campaigner told me, “I’m tired of being told how to suck eggs.” Political commentators did not seem to understand the vast array of activist experience iniduals brought to this campaign, nor the legacy of the marriage equality referendum which trained many canvassers and organisers for this battle. This is an existential issue for the Irish media, which needs to reflect on a disconnect that is pronounced. We were told this was a isive campaign. It was a unifying campaign. We were told this was a difficult issue for people, yet for many it was straightforward. We were told it was the third rail of Irish politics, so instead, the people led, from the activists and protestors to the canvassers and ordinary women and men who rolled up their sleeves, to the Citizen’s Assembly, to the women who shared their abortion stories. We were told about Middle Ireland. There is no Middle Ireland. Just Ireland. Its islands, villages, cities, towns, coasts, midlands, mountains, estates, flats, and fields. This campaign was intergenerational. Younger activists stood on the shoulders of those gone before them, and brought an energy, fearlessness, creativity and sense of unrelenting determination and optimism that inspired people across the board. The brilliantly eclectic make-up of the campaign brought in doctors, mothers, lawyers, students, trade unionists, the LGBT community, feminists, and everyone in between.Who did the No campaign really have in the end, apart from a cabal of fringe fundamentalists whom no one can really understand how or why they have gained such a platform and unfettered access to the media? The No campaign drove recklessly and ended in a car crash. They alienated undecided voters at every juncture with extreme messaging. In the final weeks, the No campaign acted as an asset to the Yes campaign, with spokesman John McGuirk, who revelled in bizarre statements, and campaigners such as Ronan Mullen getting short shrift, particularly when he disrespected a woman who shared her abortion story in a television debate. No amount of media training could connect No campaigners with the public. So what does this all mean? I bumped into the theatre-maker Grace Dyas in the RDS, “Today I feel accepted, loved, cherished.” This wasn’t just about abortion. It was about women feeling equal and valued, liberated and supported. “We did it,” everyone kept saying. “Landslide,” was the most repeated word. “Secrecy is not the same as private. Secrecy is toxic. Private is mature and grown up,” one campaigner said in the hotel across the road from the RDS. No more. No more secrecy, no more shame, no more stigma, only support, kindness, and care. Ireland has not just changed its constitution, or its society, it has changed the world with this vote. It has changed the world because in many countries - and American states - women’s reproductive rights are under attack. Ireland has stood up for women on a global stage. It’s hard to quantify how this feels. But once again, Ireland has shown its true colours. Our strength is not in our sameness, it’s in our ersity. Our strength is not our past, but our future. Our strength is not in inidualism, but togetherness. Our strength is not in dogma, but in empathy. To those women who have suffered under the eighth amendment, as a nation, we need to apologise to them. I’m sorry. We’re sorry. We’re better than that. What’s happening now is who we are.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-US summit must be held successfullyHope that US-North Korea summit may go ahead in JuneUS president responds positively to \u0026lsquovery nice statement\u0026rsquo from Pyongyang about desire for talksWhen Taisuke Miyagawa bowed to the nation for his college football hit, it resonated deeplyBerlin and Beijing stand by Iran nuclear deal despite US decision to withdraw from pactDemolition witnessed by foreign reporters but no independent scientists presentGermany\u0026rsquos task is to keep both China and US onside despite contentious trade surplusesMalaysian minister announces conclusion of operation to locate missing planeAccusations of censorship as Otago University says people found cover \u0026lsquoobjectionable\u0026rsquoRoot-and-branch reform under way as regime that ruled for half a century is dismantledTalks between North and South may resume on Friday after military drills involving US finishChinese affluence and urbanisation is leading couples to want to have fewer offspringVirus transmitted by bats and pigs identified as having potential for major outbreakWitness said Philip Wilson ordered him to recite 10 Hail Marys after reporting assaultUS has condemned landings of nuclear-capable aircraft as destabilising the regionSeoul Letter: feminist revolt takes on Confucian patriarchy in IT, arts, politics and filmPyongyang may pull out of talks over air force drillsProperty raid part of inquiry into Najib Razak\u0026rsquos role in major graft scandalDays after election defeat, armed police carry out raid in connection with graft inquiryTrump says \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquoll see what happens\u0026rsquo as North Koreans threaten to cancel meeting"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510151.1527407150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea committed to complete denuclearisation says moon jae in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in walk after their meeting at the northern side of Panmunjom in North Korea. Photograph: South Korea Presidential Blue HouseAP North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to “complete” denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and to a planned meeting with US president Donald Trump, South Korean president Moon Jae-in said on Sunday.In Washington, Mr Trump signalled that preparations for the summit with Kim were going ahead.Mr Moon and Mr Kim agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-US summit must be held successfully, Mr Moon told a news conference in Seoul.“Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean peninsula’s denuclearisation and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,” Moon said.The meeting was the latest dramatic turn in a week of diplomatic ups and downs surrounding the prospects for an unprecedented summit between the United States and North Korea, and the strongest sign yet that the two Korean leaders are trying to keep the on-again off-again meeting on track.A statement from North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said Mr Kim expressed “his fixed will” on the possibility of meeting Mr Trump as previously planned.Mr Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Mr Trump in Washington in a bid to keep the high-stakes US-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Mr Trump’s “firm will” to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.While maintaining that Mr Kim is commited to denuclearisation, Mr Moon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what that means, and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.In a letter to Mr Kim on Thursday, Mr Trump had said he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea’s “open hostility.”But on Saturday, Trump said he was still looking at a June 12th date for a summit in Singapore, adding that talks were progressing very well.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.The Trump administration is demanding that North Korea completely and irreversibly shutter its nuclear weapons program. Mr Kim and Mr Trump’s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.Mr Moon said he held Saturday’s impromptu meeting, the second summit between the two sides in a month, at Mr Kim’s request.“Chairman Kim requested a meeting without any formality two days ago and I gladly accepted it,” Mr Moon said, noting that the summit was in line with previous agreements for the two leaders to meet more often.“A meeting was held because officials of both countries thought that meeting face-to-face would be better than a phone call,” Mr Moon said.Their talks at the Panmunjom border village, which South Korean officials said lasted two hours, came after their April 27th meeting, the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade that was also held at the same venue. At that meeting, they declared they would work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War.The KCNA statement said Mr Kim and Mr Moon agreed to hold high-level talks between their two nations on June 1st, and to take steps to quickly implement their efforts to denuclearize the peninsula. KCNA said the leaders also agreed to meet frequently.The agency said the two leaders had reached a “satisfactory consensus” and expressed “their stand to make joint efforts for the decentralization of the Korean peninsula.”Mr Moon said while Mr Kim is committed to denuclearisation, North Korea is not convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.“However, during the US-South Korea summit, president Trump clearly emphasised that we may see not only the end of hostile relations but also economic cooperation if North Korea denuclearises,” Mr Moon said. “I urge North Korea and the US to confirm each other’s will by sharing their problems with each other and communicating directly.”A senior South Korean official later said that the two Koreas are discussing a possible non-aggression pledge and the start of peace treaty talks as a way of addressing Pyongyang’s security concerns ahead of US-North Korean negotiations.Video and a photo released by South Korea’s presidential Blue House on Saturday showed Mr Kim hugging Mr Moon and kissing him on the cheek three times as he saw Mr Moon off after their meeting at Tongilgak, the North’s building in the truce village, which lies in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - the 4 km wide buffer that runs along the heavily armed military border.Mr Moon is the only South Korean leader to have met a North Korean leader twice, both times in the DMZ, which is a symbol of the unending hostilities between the nations after the Korean War ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508377.1527276417!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"get your voice heard on brexit talks corbyn urges ni politicians","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, poses for a selfie with Prof Deirdre Heenan during a visit to Lifford Bridge on the Border.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table in London, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he urged Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party to reach a deal on restoring Stormont. “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade. The EU is not a foreign, far-away bureaucracy – it’s a couple of miles from where we sit. “It’s where many of our staff live and where we find our customers and trading partners. Everybody accepts that it would be unacceptable to reintroduce a hard Border in Ireland.”However, she warned that it is “infinitely more difficult to understand” the declarations from London politicians that the UK “can pull out of the customs union and single market” and avoid a hard Border.“The truth is we just cannot see how you can square this circle: to both leave the EU and to ensure no Border – to create the unique solution for NI Ireland and to do it without damaging our peace and prosperity.”Speaking directly to Mr Corbyn, she said the customs union and single market offer a market of 500 million people: “It’s under those conditions that we have built the business community that you are sitting with this morning.”Warning that local patience is “wearing thin”, she insisted that the British government’s favoured options of a customs partnership, or a technological deal to solve Border issues do not “inspire confidence”.Urging more British politicians to visit Northern Ireland, Bonnie Anley, the chair of Foyle Port, said it is “vital” that they “experience and see” the day-to-day realities that are now facing local firms.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 delivers up to 20,000 lightning strikesGuitar maker Fender and four Japanese musical instrument manufacturers raided in price-fix probeFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Comment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herMutiny Festival cancelled after two people die amid warnings of \u0026#34high strength or bad batch\u0026#34 substancesKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inSchools to let students study technical qualifications instead of A-levelsComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideGovernment quietly planning for Britain to stay in EU after March deadline, Eurosceptics fearComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM.

Whilst A levels provide a world class academic qualification, many technical education courses are undervalued by employers and don’t always provide students with the skills they need to secure a good job - that has to change, he said. Naming the first 52 colleges and providers where young people will be able to study the first T levels is an important step forward, and we will continue the work with business and the education sector so everyone can benefit from these vital reforms.The locations are spread across the country and include further education colleges, schools, community colleges and training centres. The West Midlands is the region with the highest number of centres, with ten providers including University College Birmingham, City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and Bordesley Green Girls’ School \u0026amp Sixth Form signed up to the scheme. In Yorkshire and the Humber schools including Barnsley College, York College and Notre Dame Catholic Sixth Form College are set to provide the qualification.Six schools and colleges in London are signed up, as well as four in the north east of England, five in the north west and nine in the south east. The east of the country has the fewest providers, with just one centre, Derby College in the East Midlands, and three in the East of England. The courses will include three month industry placements and a curriculum designed by employers.Earlier this week the Institute for Apprenticeships announced the draft content for the first three qualifications, and asked for feedback from further education providers by June 4. Which A-levels to take for the most popular degreesThe construction course will focus on design, surveying and planning, with modules covering topics including health and safety law, environmental performance, the internet of things and team management. The digital course will cover production, design and development, including topics such as internet security, data management, and the ethical issues raised by an increasing reliance on technology. On the education and childcare course students will learn about child development, ersity legislation, child language acquisition, and how to work with parents.  The courses were initially supposed to be launched by 2019 but last summer skills minister Anne Milton announced that the timetable had been delayed by a year.Commenting on the announcement, the Prime Minister said: Everyone should be able to have access to an education that suits them, but we know that for those that don’t choose to go to university, the routes into further technical and vocational training can be hard to navigate.  That’s why we’re making the most significant reform to advanced technical education in 70 years to ensure young people have gold standard qualifications open to them whichever route they choose. T-levels provide a high-quality, technical alternative to A-levels ensuring thousands of people across the country have the skills we need to compete globally – a vital part of our modern industrial strategy.Department for Education\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 delivers up to 20,000 lightning strikesFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Guitar maker Fender and four Japanese musical instrument manufacturers raided in price-fix probeComment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herMutiny Festival cancelled after two people die amid warnings of \u0026#34high strength or bad batch\u0026#34 substancesKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideGovernment quietly planning for Britain to stay in EU after March deadline, Eurosceptics fearComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

Perhaps he thought my marriage was on the rocks and I needed somewhere to go. Or did he think I’d been up to some sort of financial no good, and required a safe haven?Neither, touch wood, is true. It turned out he was referring to the prospect of a Labour government. “Mine’s in Switzerland. I‘ve got an apartment there, I’ve worked it all out, I can live and work there, I can come and go, still see the family, and not have to pay higher taxes.”Others, he said, were doing the same. He seemed surprised that I hadn’t planned my own escape route.We did not get into the detail, about how he was going to structure his tax affairs, but I didn’t doubt him. Indeed, subsequent conversations revealed that he was correct: plenty of City folk are readying to decamp, rather than face the prospect of increased income tax and other punitive measures coming their way.Which is why the shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s current drive to woo the City will prove so fruitless.In his speech at Bloomberg’s headquarters, to launch his campaign, McDonnell proposed, a “new start in the relationship between Labour and the finance sector”. Financial services, he claimed, will have a “seat at the policy-making and policy delivery table” under a future Labour government.He insisted the City has a role to play in the “transformative programme” he will seek to introduce if his party wins the next general election.Quite what McDonnell had in mind for that transformative programme was outlined in a subsequent TV interview: “At the end of the day, I want a socialist society. And that means transforming in a way which radically challenges the system as it now is. And I think that’s what we’re doing. And what’s interesting, we’re taking people with us, because people see that there has to be that transformation.” Added McDonnell: “We cannot allow another crisis to occur that occurred in 2007 where we all have to pay for that.”Apparently, if he is true to his word, McDonnell wants City representatives to be “at the policy-making and policy-delivery table” when Labour’s plans are hardened and approved. Try as I might I cannot imagine who they will be, and, more to the point, how they will make themselves heard.Smith’s “prawn cocktail offensive” actually made some headway. The City respected Smith (liked would be putting it too strong). He was viewed as a moderate, sensible. He was also shadow chancellor during a period of economic recession, when the Tories were not highly regarded by the business community.Then came Tony Blair’s push. He drew appreciative nods with his early, ground-breaking moves, like scrapping clause 4 of the Labour constitution, so removing the lingering doubt that privatised utilities might be renationalised, and making the setting of interest rates independently of government and political influence.Blair and his colleagues also spoke the right language. Peter Mandelson’s declaration of being “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” might have caused eyebrows to shoot skywards in some party circles, as being too much, even for capitalism-embracing New Labour, but it was well received in the City.Now we have McDonnell and his so-called “cup of tea offensive”, seeking friendly chats with business leaders to try to win them round to Labour’s way of thinking, claiming he wants them in the room, around the table, rather than outside.But, compared with his predecessors, McDonnell really is wasting his time. The City is not stupid. It can see what this shadow chancellor is about. That he despises capitalism that he, along with his boss, Jeremy Corbyn, aspires to see the recreation of a socialist, Venezuelan-type model in the UK, even though Venezuela’s economy has come close to total collapse.The City is acutely aware, too, McDonnell and Corbyn have come a long way precisely on the back of attacking the financial services industry, and all it stands for. Suddenly, they’re making overtures – after a fashion. Why?Because, as they say they want to change the system, and if they’re going to get their initiatives through – such as workers being encouraged to buy their own companies – it will be much easier with City support than without. Because the City represents a rare international success, a huge magnet for overseas investment, and a major plank in our economy. And because they need its capital-raising expertise, and its cash. As McDonnell says: “I don’t expect some people to be overjoyed at having to pay a bit more in income tax or corporation tax or at the introduction of a financial transaction tax.”Not overjoyed is one way of putting it. As my pal indicated, the City long ago made up its mind about McDonnell, well before he began his cup of tea offensive. Never have so many tea leaves been picked in vain.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and executive director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firm.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is what I want you to knowThis risk, and the cost to the NHS, increases with every point of BMI and could result in a major economic toll as well as the health cost if governments fail to get to grips with it, the researchers from the UK and Ireland said.While Scotland currently has fractionally higher rates of morbid obesity, 4 per cent in 2015 compared with 3 per cent in England and Wales, this is due to reverse.Under current trends it is predicted that 11 per cent of the population in Wales will be morbidly obese in 2035, roughly 340,000 adults, while Scotland is likely to plateau at about 5 per cent and England will rise to about 8 per cent.“Wales have a greater portion of the population deprived per capita than England, this may be a potential reason,” Laura Webber, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a director of public health modelling at the UK Health Forum, told The Independent.“In terms of morbid obesity specifically, Wales only have one obesity clinic, which could also impact.”Morbidly obese people should be given free flu jabs, says healthKhan to ban junk food advertising on London transportIn England, where close to 4.4 million adults will be affected, 16 per cent of men between the age of 55 and 64 are predicted to be morbidly obese – the highest prevalence of any group.“The morbidly obese group are particularly vulnerable to diseases, which is of course very costly to the NHS,” Ms Webber added.Morbid obesity is already a huge burden on the economy and health services, accounting for around a third of all obesity-related costs.While overweight and obesity trends for Great Britain have been projected to 2035, until now there have been no trend estimates for morbid obesity.BMI is a widely accepted measure of obesity, calculated as a person’s weight ided by their height squared, to be morbidly obese it must exceed 40kgm2. Other metrics look at whether a person is suffering obesity related diseases before age 35.The latest findings on morbid obesity are being presented at the European Obesity Congress in Vienna on Saturday.Webber and her co-author, Laura Keaver from the Sligo Institute of Technology in the Republic of Ireland, said measures to reverse these trends and the underlying social causes “must be an important public health priority”.Health news in picturesHealth news in picturesResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping activeA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.\u0026#13Research from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.The family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. Thousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.Most breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.A record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.The number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.Human eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take partTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.A major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselvesNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.\u0026#13Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followedMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.\u0026#13Vaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.\u0026#13Millions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.\u0026#13An injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.\u0026#13Women who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.\u0026#13A major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.The Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.\u0026#13The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).Cervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.The ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Growth in obesity is predicted from annual health reports from each country – there was insufficient data for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – coupled with employment and education data – socioeconomic factors that have been shown to be important predictors of BMI.In Scotland, the significantly slower rate of growth can be attributed to work carried out by the Scottish government in addressing inequality, the researchers said.“The government put a massive push on developing a route map for how we can actually combat this,” said Ms Keaver.“They put together resources from the NHS that were proving to be effective. They did put a lot of work into it.”Meanwhile in England a tax on sugary drinks has helped many producers reformulate their products, but a voluntary levy on sugary foods has not resulted in manufacturers making significant reductions.For Wales, where the inequality between people in managerial-level jobs and routine or manual professions is expected to become more significant, the pair say health interventions should be targeted at these groups.A spokesperson for Public Health Wales told The Independent: “Health trends and future predictions are complex, and predictions should not be taken as facts – they provide us with a picture of where past trends may take us if nothing changes, and give us great motivation to try and change those trends for a better future.While tackling obesity, especially in early years, is a priority and a new obesity strategy is under development – to be published in the autumn – they added “we have a significant challenge to overcome”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.As its structure is so different, the i-motif can be used as a switch when paired with regular DNA – with the two different shapes being recognised as either “on” or “off”.This has already been applied in basic nanomachine applications, and work by Dr Waller and her colleagues has expanded the repertoire of switches that can be used in such settings.By adding copper salts to DNA in oxygen-free conditions, they found DNA could be changed into an i-motif shape. This could then be further modified into another shape called a “hairpin” by adding oxygen to the mix.These results were published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.“One of the direct applications is in DNA-based computing,” explained Dr Waller.Decoding rose DNA could allow scientists to create better flowersThe concept of DNA computing has floated around for years, with Microsoft investigating potential applications and using DNA for data storage.Some scientists have used the code of DNA to store information, or constructed simple logic gates and circuits.“You can use DNA to make logic gates and one of the advantages in using DNA is computing is that you can carry out calculations in parallel if your different types of logic gates are represented by different triggers or ingredients,” said Dr Waller.“So the fact we have discovered separate triggers for the same type of DNA means you could increase the output you could actually use.”Other technological applications of DNA include the creation of tiny “nanobots” that can deliver drugs to parts of the body.“DNA is biocompatible, so if you make a nanomachine out of DNA you can introduce it to a cell and it doesn’t get destroyed or recognised as quickly as some other agents we introduce,” said Dr Waller.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Civil liberties campaigners called on Sainsbury’s to ditch the surveillance screens, which were branded a “gross intrusion” of privacy and a “blatant attempt to intimidate customers”. One Sainsbury’s regular, who did not want to be named, told The Independent she had been a customer for decades but was “shocked” to find herself being filmed while purchasing her groceries at a branch in central London. “Not only does it feel like there is mistrust and that you are potentially guilty of something, but there’s also the fear they will be storing your data.” She added: “I shan’t be using their self-service machines ever again. I felt violated.”Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12bn merger with AsdaAnother shopper, Alex Durham, said he encountered the screens at an outlet in Fitzrovia, London. The 27-year-old filmmaker said: “It struck me as bizarre really. I don’t want to seem all tinfoil hat, but it just seemed a little bit Orwellian. “It’s a bit bizarre just to be looking at your face while you’re doing something, because it really feels like someone is over your shoulder while you’re just getting a packet of crisps and a coke.“It just felt a little bit strange.”After asking Sainsbury’s about the cameras, he was told they were to help “facilitate a better customer journey”. Other customers complained on social media to the supermarket. One said a screen “clearly” showed the pin machine, while another posted an image showing a Sainsbury’s monitor displaying a keypad. I took a photo this morning and you can clearly see the pin machine and keypad. I’ll be boycotting this store and any other store that has these screens. It’s insane. pic.twitterQqE2PINOsO“What’s up with recording customers entering their PINs at the self-checkout?” Gabriel Currie asked. One Twitter user said the CCTV meant you could see down my top and this image was displayed on the screen.Complaining to Sainsbury’s, Chloe Heatlie said: “It’s pretty creepy to be frank with you. Certainly didn’t benefit my customer experience.”Multiple social media users vowed to boycott the machines, and even Sainsbury’s itself, until the screens were removed.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said the cameras were part of a “security measure” to increase safety at its stores. UK news in picturesUK news in picturesRory Mcilroy has taken the clubhouse lead in round two of the BMW PGA championship at Wentworth.Alastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

The screens act as a deterrent to customers by making them more aware they are being watched.Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, said: “Sainsbury’s new self-surveillance screens are a gross intrusion of shoppers’ privacy, broadcasting the contents of our wallets and baskets. “These new cameras are a blatant attempt to intimidate customers and make us feel more closely watched than ever.“It is absolutely disgusting for Sainsbury’s to treat its loyal customers like criminals, especially as it is now nigh on impossible to get a human checkout. Big Brother Watch calls on Sainsbury’s to remove these surveillance screens urgently.”Sainsbury’s said it had installed the cameras at more than 300 stores, but refused to say if they would be rolled out to its remaining 1,100 outlets or whether the monitors were proving an effective deterrent.The supermarket said footage from its self-facing cameras, some of which were installed last year, were kept for 31 days before being overridden. According to a recent study, £3.2bn worth of goods is stolen from UK self-service tills every year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat?

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its head vet, Claire Miller, said: “It’s widely known that animals do wonders for our emotional and physical health, so it’s great to see that as a nation we really do believe that they are great for our overall happiness.“While pets can help to boost our mood, we of course also need to ensure that they are happy too.“A diet that’s high in nutritional value and is balanced, combined with plenty of exercise, will ensure that they thrive.“Look out for a wagging tail in response to human contact from your pooch or a kitty settling on your lap.“These are clear indications that you make your pet as happy as they make you.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy. Doomed. Doomed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, its occupant is a Russian oligarch, a man worth upwards of $11 billion.Mr Abramovich bought the chateau in 2001, two years before he secured a major foothold in the UK, buying Chelsea Football club.As the first Russian oligarch in London, he turned the club around and built up an empire in the British capital.It now includes his Kensington mansion and a Russian Steel firm, Evraz, which is headquartered in London and, this year, has been the best performing FTSE 100 company, gaining 42%.A public footpath runs along one of the chateau\u0027s perimeter walls. As we walk along, the cameras move and follow us. For someone who values his privacy, it\u0027s a wonderful spot.Moored off shore is his boat, the Eclipse: registered in Bermuda, with a crew of 70, a helipad, a mini submarine.It is staggeringly large.Beyond it is another yacht, a little smaller, but still huge. This was Mr Abramovich\u0027s too, until he lost a bet and handed it over to a mate.We approach the Eclipse and politely call out to the staff on board.As an attempt to find and speak to a Russian billionaire about his visa issues, this was always likely to be futile. And so it was.Our first introductions were met with a clear \"no\".But on the radio from our boat to the bridge of the Eclipse we managed a brief convention.Could we find out, I ask somewhat foolishly, whether Mr Abramovich is aboard and able to speak to us.\"That\u0027s all well received, Sir. At this moment in time we are unable to comment on the location of any guests. That\u0027s unable to comment. Thank you.\" Obviously he wasn\u0027t going to speak to us, but a little bit of his empire up close is a useful hint of the life of an oligarch.So what\u0027s the British government\u0027s apparent issue? Russian man gets rich, enjoys life, invests in London plenty have.Why, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said this week, will the UK \"continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin?\"On the specifics of Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issue, the UK government has not commented.Sources close to him, quoted in the Russian media, say there isn\u0027t a problem, just a delay.Mr Gould-Davies was serving in the British Embassy in Moscow when KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London.He has watched Russian behaviour in Crimea, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and, most recently, the Salisbury attack.\"Russian and other wealth in the UK has long been an ethical concern, but we have a dramatic new concern in particular since the events in Salisbury,\" he said.\"Russia is presenting a more aggressive threat to the United Kingdom and other Western European countries than it has at any time since the Cold War period.\"Now the Russian state, the Putin regime, depends upon elite networks of power and influence and wealth.\"So the Russian State is on the one hand presenting a threat on the other hand it\u0027s been sustained and supported by elites who make use of the UK\u0027s financial services to keep their wealth safe.\"That cannot be right.\"On the same day that Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issues emerged, the British government\u0027s foreign affairs select committee published \"Moscow\u0027s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK\", a report which recommended that the government cracked down on Russian wealth in the UK.It is something that American banker and author Bill Browder has been calling for ever since he accused the Kremlin of murdering his lawyer. Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009.He had represented Mr Browder, who had been accused of tax fraud by the Kremlin.He lobbied the US congress to introduce the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights abuses with sanctions.He has called for the same in Europe and the UK.\"The US has made a very complete list. They made a list of 200 oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. I think you could operate off of that list and the US sanctioned seven of those individuals. I think the UK as a first step should sanction the same individuals that the US has sanctioned,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich is not among those sanctioned in the US and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.But Mr Browder says all oligarchs close to the Russian president should be targeted.\"Most oligarchs did the deal with Putin and effectively became his business partner.\"And so when you hear about an oligarch worth $13 or $14 billion, probably $7 [billion] of that is Vladimir Putin\u0027s. \"And so, if you want to go after Vladimir Putin, you go after the oligarchs,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich\u0027s proximity to Putin goes back years.Well before he acquired Chelsea, he was one of Russia\u0027s most influential businessmen.He was close to Mr Putin\u0027s predecessor Boris Yeltsin he helped Mr Putin rise and he benefited from it.Mr Browder welcomed the decision this week to pass into law the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which includes the \"Magnitsky amendment\" allowing the British government to freeze the assets and ban the visas of human rights violators from Russia and elsewhere.\"That\u0027s an absolutely powerful tool that can be used and should be used aggressively against these Russian oligarchs,\" he says."},{"url":null,"title":"best cycling routes uk families","story":"AdvertorialUK’s best bank holiday bike routes for families revealed – plus the things all cyclists need to packWhy not pack up the bikes - and a sandwich or two - and head out on a group adventure?\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:21, 25 MAY 2018Updated12:56, 26 MAY 2018AdvertorialThere are so many rides to choose from\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLife doesn’t get much better than spending the bank holiday weekend cycling around some of the UK’s most beautiful spots with your loved ones. \u2028Considering where to go and in need of inspiration? We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

MPs want Theresa May to decide where her loyalties lie after Ireland voted for legalisation - while Northern Ireland retains some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. Only women whose lives or serious health are at risk can get abortions in Northern Ireland, forcing thousands to travel desperately across the Irish Sea each year. Several prominent Tories including the Equalities Minister have now renewed demands that women in Northern Ireland win the right to abortion. Women and equalities minister Penny Mordaunt said the referendum signalled a historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland. That hope must be met, she demanded.  Tory Nicky Morgan and three other former holders of the equalities job - Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Maria Miller - all back Ms Mordaunt. And more than 140 women are said to be prepared to back an amendment to the domestic violence bill, coordinated by Labour MP Stella Creasy, to allow abortions in Ulster. Ms Creasy urged MPs: Make sure we don’t leave Northern Irish women behind. It comes after voters in Ireland axed the country\u0027s hardline abortion ban by repealing the Eighth Amendment in a historic referendum result. The Yes camp won 66% of the vote, 706,349 ahead of the No camp, after thousands of women flew home to vote from as far as Asia and Argentina. Yet Northern Ireland\u0027s abortion ban remains, separate to both the Republic and the rest of the UK.  Tory former Cabinet minister Justine Greening said: A similar debate needs to happen in Northern Ireland. It forces Prime Minister Mrs May into a political nightmare because she relies on the hardline, right-wing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to prop up her regime. The Tories gave more than \u0026pound1billion to Northern Ireland to win the support of the DUP\u0027s 10 MPs on key votes in Parliament. And last night the DUP\u0027s Ian Paisley made clear the strength of opposition Mrs May would face. He warned Northern Ireland should not be bullied into accepting abortion on demand.

NHS data shows overweight and medically obese kids under five needed 473 hospital appointments last year. That is more than double the number treated a decade ago and a rise of nearly 20 per cent in a year. Almost a quarter of children are now overweight or obese when they start primary school. This figure rises to 34 per cent by the time they leave for senior school.  Britain’s childhood obesity crisis is now so grave that in some regions more than half the kids are overweight by the age of 11. It is believed many youngsters are eating up to 500 calories more than the recommended daily amount – the equivalent of an extra meal. Separate figures show the number of children and teenagers with type 2 diabetes – a condition associated with unhealthy lifestyles in middle age – has soared by 25 per cent in four years. Type 2 diabetes is caused by eating too much, not having enough healthy food and exercising too little.

Jean and Alan Young thought they were home free when they reached the front of a ‘mile-long’ queue at the supermarket - until Alan’s card was declined. The cashier agreed to keep the 71-year-old\u0027s shopping while he returned to his home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, to find out what was wrong. He later returned to the store in Milnrow to ask if the items could be kept one more day until his pension came through.  But he was stunned when the cashier told him a woman had stumped up the cash for his \u0026pound49 shop, Manchester Evening News reports.   The mystery stranger did not leave any contact details and asked the cashier to wish Alan a nice day. “I just stood there like a gormless idiot and thought she must be joking,” the pensioner said. “You read about all this evil going on and this just feels unreal - it’s like floating on air,” he added. The act of kindness came after an awful year for Alan who had just left hospital the day before as he had battled an E.coli infection for five weeks following a serious operation. He and Jean, 68, now want to thank the stranger from the bottom of their hearts. “I can’t get over it,” he said. “I’m 71 and you think you’ve experienced just about everything but it was just unbelievable.

The MV Oliver Cromwell , a steamer and riverboat hotel, sank around 12 miles off the coast during a journey to Ireland, sparking panicked calls to emergency crews.   The local Holyhead Coastguard were called at around 2pm to reports of the incident, but they could not do anything to prevent the boat sinking around three hours later, the Daily Post reports .  The boat, which was built in 1922 and converted into a riverboat hotel in 1993, was heading to Coleraine on Wednesday after being sold to a new owner.  Nobody was injured and the coastguard said the sinking did not cause any pollution. The RNLI were also called out to assist with the operation. An RNLI spokesman said: “The call from UK Coastguard at 2.20pm cited a paddle steamer on tow towards Ireland taking on water approximately 10 miles west of South Stack. “Holyhead ’s Severn class all-weather lifeboat Christopher Pearce launched immediately and headed to the scene, arriving there within 40 minutes.  “On arriving at the scene, it was evident the 36-metre vessel was in trouble and beginning to sink from the bow. “She was being towed by tug towards Ireland after a period in the south of England.” The crew found that the paddle steamer did not have anyone on board, and did not contain any fuel. The spokesman added: “A very quick decision was made by the coxswain that the situation was too dangerous to try and put any crew on board the stricken vessel. “Within half an hour, the vessel had sunk further into the sea, and at 4.20pm she sank completely into the 50-metre deep waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jaguar driver who sacked using","story":"NewsJaguar driver who was sacked for using phone behind wheel jailed for killing man moments after sending textSteven Russell, 42, was distracted by his mobile phone when he ploughed into Robert Morris, 57, just days before Christmas, a court heard\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByArun LalDanya BazaraaNews Reporter19:26, 26 MAY 2018Updated19:29, 26 MAY 2018NewsSteven Russell has been jailed for seven years (Image: Paul Beard / SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Jaguar driver who had been previously sacked from his job for using a mobile phone at the wheel has been jailed for killing a man moments after sending a text.  Steven Russell, 42, was distracted by his mobile phone when he ploughed straight into 57-year-old Robert Morris just days before Christmas. Mr Morris was on his way to meet his brother as he crossed Antsy road in Coventry, West Midlands, at around 11.20pm on December 17, 2016. Russell had been in constant text contact on his journey, messaging two women backwards and forwards, a court heard. A prosecutor told how Russell did nothing to avoid the collision, saying he hadn’t braked, he hadn’t swerved, he simply drove straight into Robert Morris.  The Jaguar hit him in the nearside lane, throwing him into the air. Mr Morris landed in the road behind the car and Russell stopped and called 999.  The victim was rushed by ambulance to University Hospital suffering from “multiple and severe injuries.”  Sadly, he died from his injuries three days later, on December 20. At an earlier hearing, a jury took seven hours to find former HGV driver Russell guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. He also pleaded guilty to harassing his daughter’s partner by threatening him with phone calls, texts and turning up at his home.  Russell, of Coventry, appeared at Warwick Crown Court yesterday, where he was jailed for seven years.   He was also banned from driving for eight years. Sentencing him, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC called the collision \u0027utterly avoidable\u0027. He said: This offence began when you left home that night and you were in constant text contact with two women. You were distracted throughout this whole journey, you were texting backwards and forwards throughout. I utterly reject your evidence that the texts were only received or sent at traffic lights. You were driving along using your telephone as if you were sitting at home. You are a man with a proven propensity to drive while distracted. You were only dismissed a few days before this offence. It should have been at the very forefront of your mind that mobile phones and transport do not mix.

All the ex-Commandos are understood to have been veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan war zones who were \u0026shysuffering with their mental health. The spate of deaths – described as “carnage” – came as it also emerged that a further three former soldiers are feared to have taken their own lives since the beginning of April. It is understood to have caused “grave concern” at the very highest levels of the tight-knit Marines, whose proud traditions date back 350 years.  Maj Gen Charles Stickland, who as Commandant General is head of the elite corps, is said to have expressed deep concern over the deaths. And Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan with the Army but now holds the ceremonial post of the Marines’ Captain General, has also voiced his worries. Harry recently said that both he and new bride Meghan were “shocked to the core” by stories from veterans struggling with mental health issues. He said previously: “I have seen those I have served with suffer, struggling to seek out help they desperately need.  “And we know there are more just like them who suffer in silence.” A veteran of 20 years in the Marines who was friends with one suicide victim \u0026shydescribed the recent surge in deaths as \u0026shy“utter carnage”. He said: “PTSD is a killer. It doesn’t matter who you are, how tough you are or how many medals you have on your chest. Everyone who has served in a combat zone is vulnerable and not \u0026shyeveryone will win the battle with PTSD. “One guy who died was over 6ft and looked as though he could carry the world on his shoulders. “He was a fantastic Marine but not even his best mates knew he had PTSD. “He had a loving family, a nice home and a good job. Yet he wanted to end it all.  “There is a big problem with senior non-commissioned officers, often very strong \u0026shycharacters. They look invincible but they are carrying a lot of \u0026shybaggage and are often too proud to get help.” The disclosure comes after new figures from the Ministry of Defence reveal more than 5,000 Armed Services members were diagnosed with a mental health problem last year. The MoD also revealed that 24 soldiers who joined the military under the age of 18 were medically discharged with mental health problems in 2016-17. One of the Marines who died was buried on the same day that veteran Daniel Johnston, 35, who served in the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment and the special forces, committed suicide. His body was found in woodland in West Sussex after a four-day search involving hundreds of serving and former soldiers.

The breathtaking property is in the fashionable beachside resort of Noosa, which is nicknamed the “relaxation capital” of Australia.

The animated speech included themes of love, slavery, Martin Luther King, the Song of Solomon, the Industrial Revolution, poverty, war and, even more love.  Yet, despite the speech being a roaring success with most, it evoked a few giggles among certain members of the Royal Family at the royal wedding last Saturday.  The Duchess of Cornwall was seen sniggering during the 14 minute speech and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice smirked throughout.   Kate Middleton appeared to give the Duchess of Cornwall a side-eye in what many have speculated was a signal for her to be more respectful.  Zara Tindall, daughter of Princess Anne, also had a very interesting expression after the reverend told the congregation that he would try to wrap up so Meghan and Harry can officially get married. But the Reverend Curry bats off any negativity around it, saying: They were listening in their own way. Emotions should be expanded, he added.  Laugh at me, laugh with me, it is all fine by me. Any way I can steer the message about the love of God, I am glad to do that. During his sermon he started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south.  We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan and their wedding guests.  By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  The sermon at Windsor Castle has made the Chicago-born reverend a minor celebrity across the world - prompting some to claim he used the wedding as an attempt to gain world fame - something he flat-out denies. So humble is the upbeat preacher, that he revealed he was convinced someone was pulling an April Fools joke on him when he was first asked to be a part of the big day.  Speaking on today\u0027s Good Morning Britain previously he said: I thought someone was doing an April Fool on me.   Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, went on to say that he had no idea his speech would be such a hit. He said: I have to admit I had no idea, I really didn\u0027t. I remember thinking to myself, \u0027I hope that\u0027s okay\u0027. And he said he hadn\u0027t meant to overrun so badly - speaking for more than double his alloted time - but he said he seized by the moment and was inspired by the unexpected presence of his late grandmother’s spirit in St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

Paramedics and police raced to his home to try and save him but it was too late. An inquest is expected to establish how Malcolm, known to pals as ‘Bucko’, died. But Wayne fears his family may suffer even more by never having that answered. “This is just so out of character, and his life he’s been happy and bubbly,” said Wayne. “Last Wednesday he was at a family friend’s funeral and my old brother was speaking to him and he seemed fine. And we had a happy childhood. “Anyone who knew him knew he was a happy-go-lucky lad, and we are in bits thinking, why? “Now we are worried we may never find out.” The tragedy occurred at Malcolm’s Hewitson Terrace home.  Wayne claims his sister had popped to the shops after the wedding, only to receive a call about her brother which worried her. “She came running back up and started knocking on the door but there was no answer,” he said. “She could hear his mobile ringing inside and eventually they’ve tried kicking the door in.” It was then they discovered the “loving” brother. Northumbria Police were called at around 5.40pm to assist with paramedics following a “report of concern”. “Emergency services attended and found an unresponsive man inside the property,” said a force spokesperson.

Speedos won’t get you anywhere fast – they’re the UK’s most hated item of clothing. You may think squeezing yourself into the tiny, ultra-tight trunks will make you look like James Bond. But a new survey has revealed 69 per cent of Brits reckon those “budgie smugglers” should never be worn in public – and kept strictly for your eyes only. Nearly three quarters of the women polled – a whopping 74 per cent – gave Speedos the thumbs down. That is despite the best efforts of 007 sex god Daniel Craig, who made movie history when he rose out of the sea in Casino Royale wearing nothing but the skimpiest of ultra-tight trunks.  The problem might be that other famous faces, including aging nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, 77, have also posed in the unforgiving swimwear that leaves very little to the imagination. It was designed in the 1960s to reduce drag, give support and provide freedom of movement for competitive swimmers. But Speedo admits its trunks are no longer the most popular swimwear for UK men, as many prefer looser fitting shorts. Only 13 per cent of the 3,277 people polled by YouGov actually admitted to liking budgie smugglers. Matthew Smith, of YouGov, said: “Our results show that some things really are better left to the imagination.  “No matter how ready men’s beach bodies are this summer, they might not make too many friends if they stride across the sand in a pair of Speedos.” Second most hated item of clothing in the poll was leather trousers – a favourite of rocker Rod Stewart – with 63 per cent of the votes. Crocs, the brightly coloured rubber shoes, came third with 59 per cent of the votes. Flares, as modelled by Loose Woman Melanie Brown, were fourth with 57 per cent. Clothes with elbow patches – as worn by Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean – were fifth in the poll with 54 per cent of votes.

Dr Anthony Miller, an advisor to the World Health Organisation, says pupils could suffer long-term effects from exposure to the radio waves. He warned: “Radiation from mobile phones and other wireless devices can cause changes in DNA and induce cancer in experimental animals. “Children’s skulls are thinner and absorb much more of this radiation. We ignore this at our future peril.” Campaigners claim an increasing number of people suffer from “electromagnetic sensitivity” – leading to symptoms from a lack of concentration to headaches and nosebleeds. In one disturbing case, a 15-year-old is said to have taken her own life after being overwhelmed by tiredness, dizzy spells and even itchy skin due to wifi networks at her school.  We also found children removed from class by their parents after they began to suffer nausea and concentration issues – and even a teacher who claims he was affected himself. Yet Public Health England insists wifi is safe as it uses similar frequencies to radio and TV and gives less exposure than mobiles. And that means NHS doctors currently have no diagnosis for the condition – leaving those fearing they suffer from it with nowhere to turn. Mum Debra Fry told how her daughter Jenny killed herself after developing the wifi “allergy”. The 15-year-old hanged herself from a tree following two years of crippling tiredness, headaches and even bladder problems. Debra, 57, said: “I believe she just couldn’t take any more. She had overwhelming fatigue, headaches and ear pressure, difficulty finding words, itchy skin, dizziness and stiff joints. “She was getting into trouble at school because she couldn’t concentrate and needed to urinate more than usual, so was always leaving class.  “She’d always been a very good student and a very healthy child. “I made sure she got the right nutrients, the right influences, the right education. I had no idea we were exposing her to something so dangerous.” While many of Jenny’s symptoms could be put down to teenage hormones, Debra and partner Charles Newman are in no doubt they were caused by the wireless networking technology. They say Jenny’s difficulties began when they and her school installed wifi at around the same time in late 2012. But she improved when they took out their home wifi router months later. Debra, of Chadlington, Oxon, said: “All her symptoms eased or went away when she came home, particularly at weekends and holidays. “We wanted to take her to the GP but thought our fears would be dismissed.” She told how Jenny then failed to show up at school one day in June 2015. She said: “She’d texted a friend, hinting at what she was going to do. But they’d left their phone at home. “When they realised something was wrong another friend came to tell me and we went out looking for her.”  Close to tears, Debra told how she saw her daughter in the distance, beside a tree. She said: “I thought she was standing on the bough of the hill. “I was calling out her name, asking if she was okay and reassuring her. “It was only as I got closer I realised she wasn’t standing at all and there was a noose around her neck.” Surveys have shown up to five per cent of people believe they are affected by sensitivity to radio waves. Experts are divided over whether the technology can actually cause harm. And even insurance firms play safe, with some refusing outright to cover schools against claims for exposure. Lloyds of London syndicate CFC Underwriting excludes school liability for injuries “resulting from or contributed to by electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetism, radio waves or noise.” Another firm, Zurich, will offer cover. But Tilden Watson, head of education products, said: “As with any insurance, we would consider the school’s specific involvement in use and supply of the technology.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer – a branch of the World Health Organization – classes wifi as a Group 2B cancer risk, meaning there is not yet enough evidence to dismiss a possible link.  Wifi is included because it uses similar technology to mobile phones. Public Health England says a year spent near to a wifi hotspot would give the same dose of radio waves as a 20-minute mobile call. Canadian Dr Miller believes WHO should increase the risk rating. He said: “We know that when humans are exposed to cancer-causing agents, it’s usually quite a delay before you see the full effect. We’re concerned when those children become adults their risk of cancer will be much greater. “We could be storing up higher cancer rates in the future. Since radio frequency radiation was graded 2B there have been more studies showing this increased risk. “In my view it should be on the same level as tobacco and asbestos. It should not be allowed in school.”  Schools in France, Belgium and parts of America already ban or limit wifi use. And campaigners are urging the UK to follow suit until more research is carried out. Mum-of-three Alisa Keane has taken her three sons out of school because she believes the wifi was making them ill. Alisa, of Downpatrick, Co Down, said James, nine, Conn, seven, and six-year-old Dara suffered headaches, nausea and concentration issues. She is now home schooling them after seeing how the “fog” lifted away from the classroom.  And in Doncaster, dad Paul Lewis removed daughter Jessica from her junior school into a private academy after she developed headaches when wifi was introduced in the classroom. Accountant Paul says Jessica, now 15, no longer suffers the mysterious symptoms. He said: “The frustrating thing is there is no need for school wifi. “They should be using cables until it can be proved there is no risk from electromagnetic fields.”  Sarah Dacre, a trustee of charity Electrosensitivity UK, says they help “hundreds” of people with symptoms including tinnitus , skin rashes, muscle pains and memory loss.   She said: “There are clinics overseas which regularly diagnose ES with a range of tests. “But there are no such places in the UK and most GPs have no training in handling it. “New ES cases often tell us they’re unable to use smartphones or wifi routers, and that installation of smart meters has made their lives impossible.” Diana Hanson, of the Safe School Information Technology Alliance, says parents convinced wifi is making their children sick are often “extremely distressed”. She said: “People say the risk is minimal by comparing it to things on the Group 2B list such as coffee and exhaust fumes. “But we don’t give our children 10 coffees a day or sit them in a room full of running cars.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jaw dropping pictures show mighty","story":"NewsJaw-dropping pictures show mighty crocodile and deadly snake in dramatic fight to the deathThe deadly animals could be seen thrashing around in the river during an intense battle in Sri Lanka\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByPete Goddard11:35, 26 MAY 2018Updated13:13, 26 MAY 2018NewsThe dramatic battle caught on camera (Image: Caters News Agency)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A jaw-dropping fight to the death between a mighty crocodile and one of the world’s deadliest snakes has been caught on camera.  Dramatic images show the killers tossing and turning during an intense battle in the river.  The croc eventually comes out on top, with the viper clamped and thrashing beneath his powerful jaws before being gobbled down by his prey .  The dramatic incident was spotted at Yala National Park in Sri Lanka by Rishani Gunasinghe, a Patent Technology Specialist.  Rish said: “This was one such occasion. We came across a small waterhole by the main road that was home to a small croc, which most Jeeps seemed to ignore and pass by, crocs not being rare in the island. “However, there was something that initially appeared to be small and white close by, which sparked our interest and made us stop for a closer look. “Soon the croc took the white thing into its mouth and lifted it revealing a snake, and first, seeing only the underbelly and the enormous size, we assumed it was a python.  “After a few quick photographs, I noticed the unmistakable chain of dorsal spots and realized it was actually a Russell\u0027s Viper.” The Russell\u0027s Viper is one of the most dangerous snakes in all of Asia, accounting for thousands of deaths each year. Once bitten, people reportedly experience pain, swelling, vomiting, dizziness, blood clots and kidney failure. Rish added: “Seeing a Russell’s viper in the wild, one of the deadliest snakes in the world, was indeed a treat, but to see a croc with one of possibly record size, and the superb spins and tosses displayed by the croc in trying to kill and devour the viper, was quite a show and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.

The discount chain has been slammed for its decision to use factories in China, Turkey and Myanmar - which all have an appalling history with gay rights. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, formerly Burma, with punishments ranging from 10 years to life in prison. While it is not illegal in China, authorities and social networking companies in the country have attempted to clamp down on LGBT people online. And in Turkey, gay people are routinely subjected to violence and persecution, including when Turkish riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to break up a rally staged by the LGBT community in Istanbul . Primark has said it takes LGBT rights very seriously and that items in the range are sourced from a variety of different countries.   Primark are now selling RuPaul Drag Race t-shirts - but only in these few stores  People were protesting against a ban on Trans Pride and were calling for justice for transgender woman and LGBT activist Hande Kader after she was found dead in a forest. LGBT activist Steve Taylor told The Sun : “Imagine living in a country where you have to hide your sexuality, for fear of violence, reprisals or worse. Imagine working in Primark’s factory, churning out this stuff. “That is not acceptance without exception, by anyone’s standards.” The range of rainbow-themed t-shirts, caps and accessories - produced in partnership with LGBT charity Stonewall - were unveiled this week, reports Pink News .  Stonewall will receive 20 percent of the proceeds - despite cutting ties with London Pride last year after a reported fall-out between the charity and organisers. Three Primark stores near Gloucestershire - in Cardiff, Birmingham and Bristol - are stocking the Pride range. Jason Potter-Peachey, chairman of Pride in Gloucestershire, said: It gives the impression to Jo Public that you can buy this and the money will go to Pride. It\u0027s launched in time for Pride season and they have branded it as \u0027Pride-ready\u0027. It\u0027s a bit of a kick in the teeth on a local angle. Mr Potter-Peachey, membership director of UK Pride Organisers Network, added that Stonewall has little involvement in Pride events, reports Gloucestershire Live .  A Primark spokesman said: “We take LGBT rights very seriously which is why we have created a range of Pride products with Stonewall, one of Europe’s leading LGBT rights charities. We will donate 20 per cent of the sales of these products to support Stonewall’s important work, which includes campaigning globally for LGBT rights. The items in our Pride range are sourced from a variety of different countries, and as is the case with all our products, the country of origin is clearly indicated on the label.” Stonewall said in a statement: When Primark decided to launch a summer Pride range we were proud and pleased that they approached us about a partnership. They want to work with us to help embed long-term, generational change for LGBT people in the UK and internationally.

Nicky has tremendous ability and in addition to scoring he is also very good at reading the game,” he said.The 26-year-old had the option of staying at Dunfermline, for whom he hit 37 goals in the past two seasons, but admitted the lure of a move to Tannadice was too much to resist.“I am delighted to be joining a club of the stature of Dundee United and my main intention is to help the team get us up to the Premiership.“I am really looking forward to this new challenge in my career,” he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united boss front runner for morton job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer manager Ray McKinnon could be doing battle with Dundee United in the Championship next season – as boss of Morton.Word from the west today was the 47-year-old is now the clear front runner to replace ex-Dundee gaffer Jim Duffy at Cappielow.Duffy was dismissed within days of the ’Ton failing to make the play-offs at the end of the season and they’ve since been interviewing potential replacements.McKinnon is among them and looks set to be given the nod.He was dismissed by the Tangerines following a home defeat against Inverness Caley Thistle back in October.That left them down in fourth place in the division, five points off the top of the table.By the end of the campaign United were third, 13 points behind champions St Mirren.McKinnon took some time off following his departure but it’s known he is now keen to get back into management.He has been considering a number of offers, including some from abroad and the Morton job would be appealing.United, meanwhile, are continuing their revamp of the club on and off the park by advertising for a head of medicine and sports science.The holder of the newly created post will be responsible for injury prevention, management and rehabilitation.They will also be in charge of screening, nutrition and physical development within the playing squad.The club hope to have the new post filled by the start of the season.United’s new home kit for the 2018/19 season went on sale at the club shop at Tannadice today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

costs could soar to over 20m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of Dundee’s planned new stadium development could soar to well over £20 million due to access requirements.But while original estimates of the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone that will use the stadium, the associated commercial developments and the wider road network,” said a spokesman.“We’re working with the developer to get absolute clarity on their proposals and the

We have asked the developer’s consultant to carry out an appraisal of all available access options for the site.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

the International Space Station (ISS) \u0026ndash was sent to the Code Inverness computer club which won a European-wide science challenge Astro-Pi.It involved programming a small computer, a Raspberry Pi, which was taken to the ISS by astronaut Tim Peake in 2015.In the same way, seasoned scientists submit a final report of their findings, so the youngster will compile a review.Code Inverness runs three after-school groups using state-of-the-art equipment and software at An Lochran House on the UHI campus.Club founder Robert Fraser said the club\u0027 Raspberry Jam group, which won the\u0026nbspchallenge, designed a programme to analyse the living conditions including temperature, movement and humidity on the ISS.The programme was also designed to take a picture of the earth and guess whether it was looking at land, water or cloud every 60 seconds for three hours.\"The space station travels over 17,000 miles per hour, so roughly equivalent of Inverness to Edinburgh and back again every minute,\" Mr Fraser said.\"I would be happy for a train that took a couple of hours!\"His 11-year-old son, Wojtek, who inspired the project is part of the Raspberry Jam group.\"We are all really excited to get the data back,\" Wojtek said.\"We all worked as part of a team and all worked on different parts, like the camera or the heat sensor.\"I worked on the pressure sensor and opening and closing files.\"When we get the information from the ISS I think it will be interesting to find out about the temperature.\"I wonder if the astronauts notice the slight changes to temperature.\"Archie Mackie (9) attends the club\u0027 introduction to coding session.\"I like how you can make your own stuff like movement and stories,\" Archie said.\"I also like to draw so I might make my own story.\"The club is run by volunteers and code enthusiasts including Daryl Titcomb.\"It\u0027 great for the kids to be creative and try new things,\" Mr Titcomb said.Equipment and unused computer gear has been donated to the club by supportive parents and Inverness College UHI while a recent donation from MacLeod and McCallum enabled new equipment to be bought.Budding coders or

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million). There\u0027 little that can be done to increase revenue from learning, which relies on Scottish Government grants. But there\u0027 a big need to increase revenue for the care budget, particularly as the local population is ageing and many more people need care.\"Sunday 27 May 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04101000/04101605.jpg","title":"New community cafe for Merkinch","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW caf\u0026eacute in the heart of an Inverness community is aiming to become a much-needed social hub for the area\u0027 residents.The Coffee House has opened in the Bike Shed in Merkinch in a joint partnership involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship which runs a successful coffee shop in a converted fish processing factory in the Smithton Industrial Estate.The facility, in Grant Street, will open initially Wednesdays to Fridays between 10am and 3pm serving barista-made coffees at affordable prices but the aim is to extend to a fourth day and also to open in the evenings.Chris Dowling, pastor of King\u0027 Fellowship, said surveys had revealed residents felt the area desperately needed a caf\u0026eacute.\"We hope mums will call in on their way back from dropping off the children at school, as well as others in the community who might feel lonely or isolated,\" he said.\"Part of the vision is to create the best coffee shop in the Highlands in the heart of Grant Street but also a place for the community to meet.\"Sunday 27 May 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102991.jpg","title":"New riverside artwork unveiled","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspArtists Sans facon and OSA unveiled their design - two curved walls on either side of the River Ness at the Little Isle Pool, Fisherman\u0027s Car park - this morning.Tristan Surtees of Sans facon said the work aimed to \"complement the river and people\u0027s relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"For more details see tomorrow\u0027s Inverness Courier.Let us know what you think of the design at newsdesk@spp-group or on\u0026nbspthe Courier\u0026nbspFacebook page.Sunday 27 May 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102996.jpg","title":"Sporting hero to receive Freedom of the City of Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspHighland sporting hero Colin Baillie is to receive the Freedom of the City of Inverness.A notable member of the Highland Rugby Club and coach with the North and Midlands Rugby Team Mr Baillie is a also a former PE teacher who worked at Millburn Academy.He was also involved with the Inverness Harriers athletics club and an\u0026nbspenthusiastic supporter of Highland Dsiability Sport.Provost Helen Carmichael said: \"Colin has made a highly significant impact on people\u0027s lives through his dedication, commitment, enthusiasm and unique ability to encourage and stimulate, promote and develop individuals and groups through his passion and zest for life.\"For more details see tomorrow\u0027s Inverness Courier.Sunday 27 May 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
