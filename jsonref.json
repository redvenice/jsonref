is turning three today (Picture: WireImage)It’s been a big year for birthday girl Princess Charlotte after starting nursery, going on a royal tour and becoming a big sister.And she may only be celebrating turning three, but Charlotte already has a number of memorable moments.Charlotte stole the show on the day her baby brother Prince Louis was born when she visited him in hospital.The world gushed over her unbelievable cuteness as she waved for photographers while leading her dad Prince William up the steps of the Lindo Wing.Her confident reaction was in stark contrast to shy older brother Prince George, with the princess waving from the moment she got out of the car.She gripped onto her dad’s hand going into the hospital, before professionally turning her head and giving a final wave to cameras.One Twitter user said: ‘Princess Charlotte completely stole the show she is the cutest little girl and her little wave really did melt my heart.’Princess Charlotte taken by her mother at Kensington Palace shortly before the princess left for her first day of nursery (Picture: PA)The young princess started at Willcocks Nursery School, near to Kensington Palace, this year, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge releasing sweet photographs of Charlotte on her first day.The photos – taken by mum Kate – saw Charlotte beaming in a red coat, pale pink scarf and matching pink backpack.With Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding is now just a couple of weeks away, with Charlotte rumoured to be a flower girl or bridesmaid for her uncle.But the princess is already skilled at bridesmaid duties.Kate Middleton and Princess Charlotte as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews (Picture: WireImage)She took on the role when the Duchess of Cambridge’s

petals from a wicker basket and wore a headdress of white flowers.Kate took charge of the bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George, and at one point had to tell the excited children to keep quiet.Of course it is Charlotte’s cheekiness that makes her so adorable.Kate once said feisty Charlotte is ‘the one in charge’ at home with older brother George.And when she and George joined their parents for an official tour of Poland and Germany last summer, Charlotte was not about to do anything she didn’t like.The princess was pictured collecting posies, peering out of the windows of their plane with brother George – but also having a little tantrum on the tarmac.The youngster sat down on the floor in protest, but was promptly scooped up, comforted and distracted by her mother Kate.A very excited 16-month-old Charlotte giggled away as she sat down on six-year-old therapy dog Moose at a children’s party in Canada.The garden party at Government House, British Colombia, in September 2016 marked Charlotte’s first public appearance with her brother George, who was three.Footage from the day showed her bouncing up and down on the dog’s back before excitedly playing with balloons.It’s a royal rite of passage for princes and princesses so Charlotte joined the Windsors on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Trooping the Colour parade.While George appeared to have had enough, resting his head on his hand as he stood on a little step on the red cloth decorated balcony, Charlotte seemed content during the annual event.She happily watched the flypast, grinning as the

I guess it hurt enough for me to remember 60 years later\u0027.\u0027According to Simon, people thought Garfunkel was the one who wrote the songs, not him, because he \u0027looks like he writes the songs\u0027.Simon said: \u0027It came up all the time. There is a prejudice against small men and that has been a problem at times because I happen to be a sort of alpha male-ish type guy. It becomes a competitive thing.\u0027There\u0027s this attitude that \u0027I\u0027m taller, so I could beat you up, or I should be in charge\u0027.          By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027. Simon and Jagger are pictured above in 1989Eventually, when he was in his 40s, Simon said to himself: \u0027Listen man, if you\u0027re going to make a big issue out of what you don\u0027t have, you\u0027re taking your actual gifts for granted….that\u0027s the hand I\u0027ve been dealt with. That\u0027s the way I\u0027m going to play it\u0027.Elsewhere in the book Simon talks about how his height was bound up in his long running mental health issues.In 1981 he went to see Los Angeles psychiatrist Rod Gorney and told him he was so unhappy he couldn\u0027t write songs anymore.Hilburn quotes an interview with Simon from 1984 in which he says that from the outside people could not understand why he was depressed, but inside he was looking at the \u0027thin slice of the pie that has got the bad news in it\u0027.What he meant by bad news: \u0027being short\u0027, his voice and his relationships.Simon said that his issues left him \u0027unable to absorb the bounty that was in my life\u0027 and he used to joke that he would happily pay $5 million to look like his hero Elvis Presley, who was 6ft 2in tall.Simon, 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees.But his dream died because of something that Hiburn says would \u0027haunt him for years: his size\u0027. By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027.          Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade. They attended the same high school and began to play music together. The pair are pictured together in 1957          Simon (right with Garfunkel), 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees. But his dream died because of his small statureSimon said: \u0027That\u0027s what rock\u0027n\u0027roll was, and it was a really big thing with me.\u0027I once had this conversation with John Lennon, and he really wanted to know how I knew enough to keep my own publishing rather than give half of it away like the Beatles did. I told him I grew up around the music business....then I asked him: \u0027Who ever told you how to comb your hair like that?\u0027\u0027Much of \u0027The Life\u0027 is taken up with the love-hate - mostly hate - relationship between Simon and Garfunkel.Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade.They attended the same high school and began to play music together. Their first single was an R\u0026ampB number titled, \u0027Sh-Boom\u0027 in 1954. And even before they turned 18, the boys were being played on national radio. In 1957, however, they suffered a split that \u0027caused a wound so deep in Art it would never heal fully\u0027.Sid Prosen, the owner of the record label called Big which signed them, asked Simon if he could record some songs on his own and \u0027caught up in the excitement of the moment\u0027, Simon agreed.Hilburn writes that their \u0027massive mistake\u0027 was not telling Garfunkel who knew he had a great voice but was \u0027dependent on Paul for songs, which meant Paul had all the power\u0027.Garfunkel \u0027always felt in danger of being tossed aside\u0027, the book says. Simon\u0027s song flopped as did their next collaborative project and the pair went their separate ways for five years. Tank tops, flock wallpaper and a cheese plant in the corner:...\u0027She just wanted to know that he\u0027s in jail\u0027: Patton Oswalt...Share this article    Simon and Garfunkel, pictured above in 1993, have long had a love-hate relationship with each other. The biggest blow up came in 1993, when Simon\u0027s business manager had to to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.They would go through the same cycle for the next 50 years reconciliation and fighting before breaking up once more. The biggest blow up came in 1993. Simon and Garfunkel had reunited for a series of shows in New York called Event of a Lifetime that sold out so fast they added 14 more nights to the ten-night run.But the old tensions came back straight away, and Joseph Rascoff, Simon\u0027s business manager, had to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.He said: \u0027I genuinely believed that if there had been a knife on the table, one of them would have used it\u0027.At one point Garfunkel accused Simon of getting a journalist to write a negative review of one of the sets.On another night, while playing their hit \u0027The Boxer\u0027, Garfunkel suddenly stopped singing, which Simon thought was a mistake. But after the show Garfunkel told him: \u0027I didn\u0027t forget. I just wanted you to see what it feels like to be made a fool of\u0027.The two men went at each other and, recounting the episode, Rascoff said: \u0027They never came to blows but there was shoving, and I had to step between them\u0027.Simon described the incident as \u0027ugly - the most vicious fight, verbally at least, I\u0027d had in my life\u0027.Simon ided opinion among those who met him and a veteran from the British club scene in the 1960s called him \u0027shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined\u0027.           Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974. He\u0027s pictured above, second from left, with Garfunkel (left), Yoko Ono (second right)  and Lennon in 1974Other said that he was so obsessed with music that human relationships came second.Joan Bata, a friend of his first girlfriend Kathy Chitty, said: \u0027He wasn\u0027t deliberately being hurtful. It was just that his mind was totally occupied with something else.\u0027The most striking breakup was with his first wife Peggy which is described with brutal starkness in the book.In 1974 the couple were due to go to their home in New Hope, Connecticut, but Simon was listening to his competition in that years\u0027 Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder\u0027s Innervisions.Peggy called him to join her but he was too caught up in the music so she called him again and he became angry, thinking to himself: \u0027Can\u0027t I even listen to music any more?\u0027          Robert Hilburn\u0027s biography, Paul Simon: The Life, is out on May 8 on Simon \u0026amp SchusterAs the book puts it: \u0027When Peggy called out a third time, the marriage was over\u0027. Simon simply walked out of their townhouse and moved into the Stanhope Hotel around the corner until their orce was finalized.In the book, Simon said: \u0027Ultimately I wasn\u0027t ready for marriage. The marriage didn\u0027t solve the loneliness. I knew right away I had made a mistake. \u0027I didn\u0027t know how to be a good companion. I wasn\u0027t a very mature person. I didn\u0027t understand you had to work at problems. I wanted the marriage to solve my problems.\u0027\u0027The Life\u0027 says that Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974.Lennon was constantly drunk and when Simon started to play acoustic guitar on \u0027Rock Island Line\u0027 before Lennon wanted he repeatedly told him to stop.Then Lennon started to reach over and mute Simon\u0027s guitar strings with his hand. A frustrated Simon told him: \u0027John, I play guitar too.\u0027May Pang, who was staying with Lennon at the time, said that Lennon was annoyed by Simon because \u0027unlike almost everybody else who entered John\u0027s orbit (Simon) had a powerful sense of himself and could actually refuse to be treated badly\u0027.In 2002 Simon was in Washington to receive a Kennedy Center Honor to receive an award for his lifetime of achievement to American culture through the performing arts.As he sat next to Elizabeth Taylor they watched as Alicia Keys butchered Bridge Over Troubled Water.Taylor leaned over to Simon and said: \u0027Tell me, Paul, does it upset you when somebody f**** up one of your songs?\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/23/4BB02B6C00000578-0-image-m-25_1525042160850.jpg","title":"Ashley Judd SUES Harvey Weinstein lost Lord Rings role","story":"Actress Ashley Judd (left) has sued Harvey Weinstein (right), claiming he derailed her career after she rejected his sexual advances\u0027Harvey Weinstein believes Hollywood will forgive him\u0027:...Cannes film festival will have its own sexual harassment...Share this articleJudd first spoke out in October, saying that Weinstein had sexually harassed her during the filming of the 1997 film Kiss the Girls.She claimed he invited her to his hotel room at Peninsula Beverly Hills, greeted her in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage before inviting her to watch him shower. Judd recalled that she said no multiple times and tried to get out of the room \u0027fast as possible\u0027. Jackson said in December that when he was casting for The Lord Of The Rings a year later, he was interested in Judd and Mira Sorvino, who has also accused Weinstein of harassment.\u0027I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs.

His comments come after Education secretary Justine Greening (pictured) suggested that employers should discriminate against boarding school pupils‘Why sit in a car or on a train or a bus for 45 minutes twice a day, or in a bedroom by yourself hunched over homework or a screen?‘You could be spending those hours rehearsing for a play, having a band practice, spending more time mastering your musical instrument or your goal shooting technique, spending more hours perfecting that painting, debating or discussing politics or science or history - whatever is your passion.‘Or, perhaps more importantly, real face-to-face, social time, not always virtual socialising.’The BSA represents 550 boarding schools, including some of the most elite private institutions as well as a number which are state-funded.Mr Reader said all of his schools pride themselves on encouraging children to pursue extra curricular activities in their evenings and weekends.And at Cranleigh, sixth formers are expected to do 15 hours per week of extra study outside of lessons.He said that for many children in modern Britain, a long commute to school is inevitable because they cannot get into their local school.Some parents considering boarding have even mentioned this as a motivating factor, he added.‘There are some good things about commuting to school,’ he said.‘It’s independence, and some children have no alternative.‘But wouldn’t it be better if they were able to spend that time doing lovely things?‘Why waste that time on a commute?’Mr Reader said boarding schools are also an ideal place to tackle social media, which can distract pupils from studies and cause online bullying.At Cranleigh, all pupils aged 13 are banned from having smartphones, and this has eradicated all cyberbullying for that age group, he said.‘A smartphone was not designed for a child,’ he said.‘We use to get an incident a week of something unpleasant for that age group but now we’ve had nothing.‘Children that age are not mature enough for it.‘We restrict alcohol and cigarettes as a society because they are addictive, so why not restrict something as addictive as a mobile phone.’Smart phone use is gradually phased in for older children - alongside special lessons about how to stay safe online.Sixth formers have no restrictions as they are thought to be mature enough to use phones appropriately.He added: ‘We have and many of our schools have restrictions on social media either through controlling WiFi, controlling the apps they can use, and encouraging them to spend more time with each other, doing activities where they’re not using social media. It’s beneficial.‘It encourages kids to spend real time with each other, not virtual time with each other.‘What we have done is be equally illiberal for everybody. It has helped parents. One of the hardest things about being a parent is that your child says “everyone else has got one”. There is a pressure.‘So it’s helpful when we’re all in this together.’Mr Reader also responded to Miss Greening’s comments yesterday.He said: ‘We need social mobility in this country. But businesses have to make their own decisions about what is right. It is not for government to tell businesses who is the right person for them.‘There is a real danger in constantly talking about privileged children and underprivileged children. Let’s just talk about children.‘I want to see more social mobility. But we can’t dictate what a company should do.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/00/4BBFCFDB00000578-5680351-image-a-2_1525216029937.jpg","title":"Young mothers UKs loneliest people unable afford study finds","story":"    Young mums are suffering from loneliness and many struggle financially, a poll of 2,500 adults has found          Loneliness in young mothers is causing health problems, according to a new study. More than 40 per cent of women who have babies before the age of 30  are lonely, study findsIsolation among young mothers is particularly concentrated in single mothers, with 54 per cent saying they are lonely often or all the time.

The average age of a new mother was 30.4 in England and Wales in 2016. Fertility rates among over 30s are rising as more women choose to pursue education and careers and to delay having families.As a result younger mothers are more likely to be less well-educated, less well-off and without a husband or permanent partner. The most acute loneliness is among the youngest mothers, who are also the least likely to be married or living with the father of a child.Some 49 per cent of mothers aged between 18 and 25 say they are often or always lonely, against 37 per cent of 26 to 30-year-olds.Paul Gerrard of the Co-op said: ‘People do not think of young mothers as being susceptible to being lonely but our research clearly highlights that it is a major problem.’          Financial problems leaving Britain\u0027s young mums suffering from loneliness.

Social psychologist Dr Juliet Wakefield of Nottingham Trent University said: ‘The top 10 per cent of attendees to a GP account for 30 to 50 per cent of appointments, placing a considerable strain on the healthcare system.‘They are likely to be dissatisfied with the care they receive, and are often cited by physicians as a cause of occupational stress and burnout. However, when these patients joined a social group, such as a local arts class or exercise group, their frequency of appointments fell.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/07/4B90B48100000578-0-image-a-39_1524725884400.jpg","title":"Britains five year consumer debt binge slows households look catch breath","story":"    The total owed on credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans and car finance deals rose by £254million in March - the smallest increase since 2012Analysts said it suggests households are catching their breath after living beyond their means for years.Part of the slowdown in borrowing also stemmed from the dismal weather in March as families deserted the High Street and car showrooms. Are you falling into the tap and go payment trap?

Sajid Javid is the new Home Secretary after Amber Rudd\u0027s poor handling of the Windrush scandal saw her forced to resignOne university and 57 private further education colleges were been stripped of its right to admit foreign students.But immigration barrister Patrick Lewis told the Financial Times that many of the students accused of faking the English language tests may have been wrongly accused. Some of these would have been deported.He said the harsh treatment of the foreign students - in the UK legally - highlighted the flaws in the ‘hostile environment’ strategy introduced by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014.The approach which seeks to make life tough for illegal immigrants, denying them homes, jobs, bank accounts and benefits, has been blamed for targeting Windrush generation Commonwealth migrants who did not have paperwork proving they had a right to stay in the UK.The plight of the foreign students began after the BBC’s Panorama programme aired an investigation in February 2014 alleging systematic cheating at some colleges in the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC).Mrs May responded by asking US-based firm Educational Testing Services, which ran the testing system, to analyse voice files to work out if students were using proxies to sit the tests for them.After analysing the files, ETS said it was confident 33,725 test takers had used someone else to sit the test for them. Most were told they had no right to appeal and should leave the country.But an immigration appeal tribunal in 2016 heard that when ETS’s voice analysis was checked with a human follow-up, the computer had been correct in only 80 per cent of cases.This meant that some 7,000 students had their visas revoked in error, it was claimed.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the Government response to the cheating scandal was ‘measured and proportionate’.He said that expert evidence had shown the number of false matches would be ‘very small’. He said 21 people had been convicted for helping students to fake their tests, with prison sentences totalling 68 years imposed.A Home Office spokesman said: ‘In February 2014, investigations into the abuse of English language testing revealed systemic cheating, which was indicative of large scale organised fraud.‘The Government took immediate robust action on this, which has been measured and proportionate, and so far 21 people have received criminal convictions for their role in this deception.‘There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK, nor is there any intention to impose one.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/09/4BC251CC00000578-5681477-image-a-5_1525248060821.jpg","title":"Yobs caught CCTV damaging familys car","story":"    Alyson Carson, right, and her son Connor, pictured have complained to police after a gang of yobs damaged their cars outside their home in Berwick-upon-Tweed          The gang ran over the bonnet of the car damaging the metal work, pictured          These are the shocking scenes as a mob of yobs run across the roof of a car causing damage          The miscreants caused the damage outside a home in Berwick-upon-Tweed last month \u0027They did a five or 10ft jump right into the middle of it and they can’t get the dent out at the body shop repair.\u0027My husband’s friend\u0027s car was also damaged and has a crease in the middle of it.\u0027Ms Carson lives in the border town along with her husband, Rob, 52, and sons, Connor, 22, and Daniel, 15.   The beauty therapist said the incident on April 28 was the latest in recent months and believes their house is being targeted.In the age of #MeToo, why DO so many women enjoy watching...Retired British businessman falls to his death from his 18th...Share this articleMs Carson and her son Connor\u0027s cars were vandalised by a group of yobs who ran over the top of their cars outside their home in BerwickShe said: \u0027It has been going on for about 18 months and started with apples being thrown that were stolen from a neighbour’s garden.\u0027Then there were stones and gravel being thrown and when it snowed they made snowballs filled with ice and chuck them at the windows.

Sarah and Andrew first met back in 1996, shortly after she moved to Cambridgeshire - first forging a platonic relationship after being introduced by mutual friends.\u0027We were all talking about what we\u0027d want in a spouse and, virtually at the same time, Andrew and I both said a best friend that makes me laugh,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027It was lovely having that in common. We decided to go for a drink, just the two of us, and it was a complete whirlwind from there.\u0027We were even talking about engagement rings just six weeks into being an official couple. All our friends kept laughing about how bouncy Andrew seemed, saying he had a real spring in his step.\u0027Everyone said they knew we\u0027d end up together.\u0027Starting life as a married couple, Sarah and Andrew\u0027s minds turned to children.But, after years of trying to no avail, tests revealed they both had fertility issues and sadly, IVF treatment, which they had in the early noughties, was unsuccessful.          After returning from the trip to Australia, to celebrate his landmark birthday, Andrew started seeming disorientated and forgetful. Sarah explained how he struggled with balance, often clipping into things when driving, and his body would sometimes slump to one side\u0027I said to myself we\u0027d keep going every year until I hit 40.

There, in 2006, when he was just 43, a lumbar puncture – where fluid is collected from the spine for diagnostic testing – confirmed he had a rare genetic type of dementia\u0027There\u0027s no history of it in his family, so we were told it was caused by a mutation in a gene he had called presenilin 1, which has been linked to early onset dementia,\u0027 explained Sarah.\u0027The doctors told us that, if we did have children, there was a 50 per cent chance of them getting it, too, so we decided not to carry on with the IVF.\u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have coped with seeing Andrew ill and our children watching the disease progress, then maybe even developing it themselves.\u0027In the end, we donated the unused embryos for stem cell research. For us, children were just never meant to be – but Andrew would have made a great dad.\u0027Shortly before his diagnosis, Andrew\u0027s symptoms had meant he had given up his job as a geneticist, swapping it for a job in Tesco, where he stayed for a year.As the disease progressed, he gradually became more forgetful and disorientated, ringing Sarah up to 30 times in one go, as he could not remember if they had already spoken.

But he never let on. I never saw him shout or get upset.\u0027The only time he cried was when he had to give up driving, because it\u0027d always been a big love of his. I think he felt part of him had gone.\u0027In November 2007, after Andrew became doubly incontinent, it was agreed he would move into assisted living nearby.Then 18 months later, he had a PEG tube inserted to help feed him.\u0027Before that, he\u0027d been eating mashed up food, one teaspoon at a time,\u0027 said Sarah.\u0027He looked like a skeleton.

And I say wow your hair just looks amazing today, what do you use?? I’m now sexually harassing that women????? NO I’m not and peeps like you you going to make the world dull!\u0027 Jamie Gemmell said: \u0027Trying to work out how you took the words something beautiful to be sexual. I think the problem is with you, not the message.\u0027Another added: \u0027Translation: Complimenting people is bad.\u0027Ms Rickman was also accused by others of \u0027making a mockery\u0027 of people who had suffered sexual harassment.           Ms Rickman was accused of making a \u0027mockery\u0027 sexual harassment victims          Dina Rickman defended her original post online, saying complimenting a stranger could amount to sexual harassmentJake Rattley said: \u0027Making a mockery of anyone who has suffered sexual harassment, shame on you! Disgraceful.\u0027Another person agreed, adding: \u0027This tweet is disrespectful to people who have actually been sexually harrassed.\u0027 Ms Rickman fired back at some of the replies, defending her position that compliments could be viewed as sexual harassment.Megara_35 tweeted Ms Rickman asking: \u0027Someone could be anyone? So if I say to a friend their outfits nice or their hair looks good, am I sexually harassing my friend?\u0027Ms Rickman then replied saying: \u0027Obviously not, and I think you know that. I think approaching a stranger and complimenting them on something beautiful about them can be viewed as sexual harassment and definitely doesn\u0027t brighten their day.\u0027           Ms Rickman did recieve some support on social media, with Renee Jacobs taking aim at Piers MorganMs Rickman has received some support for her opinion. Replying to Piers Morgan\u0027s dig at Ms Rickman, Renee Jacobs said: \u0027Mansplain to me again why you-a total stranger with absolutely no concept of a particular woman’s present or past circumstances-have a god given right to at any particular moment insert yourself into her space \u0026amp consciousness.

The average age of a new mother was 30.4 in England and Wales in 2016. Fertility rates among over 30s are rising as more women choose to pursue education and careers and to delay having families.As a result younger mothers are more likely to be less well-educated, less well-off and without a husband or permanent partner. The most acute loneliness is among the youngest mothers, who are also the least likely to be married or living with the father of a child.Some 49 per cent of mothers aged between 18 and 25 say they are often or always lonely, against 37 per cent of 26 to 30-year-olds.Paul Gerrard of the Co-op said: ‘People do not think of young mothers as being susceptible to being lonely but our research clearly highlights that it is a major problem.’          Financial problems leaving Britain\u0027s young mums suffering from loneliness.

Social psychologist Dr Juliet Wakefield of Nottingham Trent University said: ‘The top 10 per cent of attendees to a GP account for 30 to 50 per cent of appointments, placing a considerable strain on the healthcare system.‘They are likely to be dissatisfied with the care they receive, and are often cited by physicians as a cause of occupational stress and burnout.

And under the new rules they could be awarded up to £60,000, including aggravated damages.IPSO’s chief executive, Matt Tee, said of the development: ‘Lord Justice Leveson stressed the importance of having a low-cost means of people that had been wronged by a newspaper getting compensation, without the expense of court and legal fees.‘The new IPSO scheme does exactly that and the papers are not able to choose which cases they take.’Once IPSO has accepted the claim, a senior barrister will be appointed as an arbitrator.

Sarah and Andrew first met back in 1996, shortly after she moved to Cambridgeshire - first forging a platonic relationship after being introduced by mutual friends.\u0027We were all talking about what we\u0027d want in a spouse and, virtually at the same time, Andrew and I both said a best friend that makes me laugh,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027It was lovely having that in common. We decided to go for a drink, just the two of us, and it was a complete whirlwind from there.\u0027We were even talking about engagement rings just six weeks into being an official couple. All our friends kept laughing about how bouncy Andrew seemed, saying he had a real spring in his step.\u0027Everyone said they knew we\u0027d end up together.\u0027Starting life as a married couple, Sarah and Andrew\u0027s minds turned to children.But, after years of trying to no avail, tests revealed they both had fertility issues and sadly, IVF treatment, which they had in the early noughties, was unsuccessful.          After returning from the trip to Australia, to celebrate his landmark birthday, Andrew started seeming disorientated and forgetful. Sarah explained how he struggled with balance, often clipping into things when driving, and his body would sometimes slump to one side\u0027I said to myself we\u0027d keep going every year until I hit 40.

For us, children were just never meant to be – but Andrew would have made a great dad.\u0027Shortly before his diagnosis, Andrew\u0027s symptoms had meant he had given up his job as a geneticist, swapping it for a job in Tesco, where he stayed for a year.As the disease progressed, he gradually became more forgetful and disorientated, ringing Sarah up to 30 times in one go, as he could not remember if they had already spoken.

I think he felt part of him had gone.\u0027In November 2007, after Andrew became doubly incontinent, it was agreed he would move into assisted living nearby.Then 18 months later, he had a PEG tube inserted to help feed him.\u0027Before that, he\u0027d been eating mashed up food, one teaspoon at a time,\u0027 said Sarah.\u0027He looked like a skeleton.

Then she heard the proposed name for it – Caroline Coon: The Great Offender. “I just gasped,” she says.It didn’t take her long to realise that, actually, the name was perfect. Offending – and offending greatly – has been a large part of what Coon has spent her life doing, even if it hasn’t always been intentional. In the 1960s, she flew in the face of the establishment by setting up the drugs agency Release, which helped young people who had been arrested for drugs offences. Its clients included John Lennon and George Harrison. A decade later, she was offending her own hippy generation by documenting the punk scene for Melody Maker, providing bands with artwork for their record sleeves, and even becoming the Clash’s manager for a while. But it’s with her oil paintings and collages that she’s made some of her most provocative statements, breaking down taboos and challenging ideas of what a female artist is expected to paint. The evidence is currently displayed over every inch of wallspace in her home and studio in west London where we meet (and when the walls run out, her works stack up on the floor). Brothel scenes sit next to self-portraits replete with wrinkled wrist flesh (“You rarely see portraits of old women,” says Coon, “because we go from being whores to being witches”). Then there’s her depiction of Valerie Solanas (who shot Andy Warhol) complete with severed penis on a plate, as well as her wonderful, gender-blurring tangles of male and female bodies. They seem particularly prescient in our era of sexual fluidity, yet at the time they gained Coon the reductive nickname of The Woman Who Paints Penises. That must have been frustrating. “Frustrating?” she laughs: “No, it was a triumph! Why wouldn’t I be a woman who paints penises? That was the whole point! To be a lady was to never admit that one liked sexuality – you were meant to bear it. Even the feminists of the 70s talked about the penis as a hate object, which I found very unhealthy. Because in my heterosexual mode” – she lets out another laugh at this – “the penis is something I love to draw into myself. Of course I need to love this object!”In person, the Great Offender couldn’t be any less offensive: she’s warm and funny and has even bought fresh fruit in for the interview because she’d heard I’d been unwell. She talks about sex workers’ rights, nuclear brinkmanship and the tragedy of Grenfell tower – which you can see starkly from her living room window – in unapologetically cut-glass tones that make you wonder what the punks must have made of her back in the day. At one point, when a question about her art delights her, she takes my hand and kisses it with gratitude. Yet offending people has always been in Coon’s blood. As the child of wealthy Kent landowners, she found herself trapped in an oppressively patriarchal system where, she says, “the question was always, ‘How can I grow up into a woman who does not cause offence?’ I couldn’t be assertive, or have an opinion, and I was warned that I should hide one’s intelligence because men didn’t like intelligent women. You were expected to grow into a respectable woman, a wife and a bearer of children. Even at the age of 13, I knew I couldn’t be that.” Aware of the pain her mother and grandmother suffered after giving up on their own artistic dreams, Coon moved to London to enrol at Central St Martins. Even that could be stifling: “I went through college without being told such a thing as a woman artist existed,” she says. However she did notice the emergence of such artists as Pauline Boty, who typified women who were “working side by side with their male colleagues but not included in most of the big exhibitions”.It was Boty’s husband Clive Goodwin who gifted Coon the pop artist’s oils following her death in 1966 at the age of 28. Coon used them to paint her playful tribute to Boty’s landmark work Bum, a full frontal called simply Cunt. Not all Coon’s work deals in outrage: there are joyous street scenes celebrating the ersity of her neighbourhood and plenty of still lifes depicting tulips and peonies. Other paintings are approached with subtlety. Her Brothel Series inverts the way male artists have depicted prostitutes by putting the same scenes through a feminist lens. Sometimes this can be a typical street scene, but tucked away in the background is a punter reading a card in a shop window, or slipping down some steps. In Ladbroke Grove, Dawn: She Walks Home From Work, the car driver’s eyes are trained not on the road but at the woman traipsing home after a night shift. Coon knows she has a right to paint these scenes because she’s lived them. Her illustrated memoir Laid Bare documented her brief time as a sex worker in the early 80s. It is full of bracing honesty about the experience, as well as paintings inspired by the experience. “I did that series because I think it’s very unhealthy, and very painful, for men to want sex and then to despise the women they have sex with outside of their marriage. It means men tend to ide women against each other. We are either virgins and wives, or we are whores.”Coon can reel off a long list of male artists who’ve painted brothels, from Toulouse-Lautrec to Picasso – so many, in fact, that she says we barely notice them doing it. So why shouldn’t she? “After all, I kind of know what I’m talking about.” She smiles. “Those people were both the artists and the whore-fuckers. Well, I was the artist and also the whore.”This gets to the core of Coon’s art. She may be the great offender, but often she’s simply flipping perspectives on common narratives. In Rush Hour: She Strips Them Naked With Her Eyes, the men ogling naked bodies in the tabloids on their way to work are simply shown stripped naked themselves. Any offence caused by her work simply exposes our own hypocrisy. That was certainly the case when Tate Liverpool chose not to show her painting Mr Olympia, a pastiche of Manet’s reclining nude Olympia, because its subject had a semi-erect penis. Coon is still campaigning for the things she believes in – including fighting the criminalisation of sex work, which she believes does untold harm to society. “Most of the men and women I speak to are using pornography – which comes from sex work – so to me it’s anathema that you will use the workers for your orgasmic pleasure and then not support them as workers like you would teachers or nurses.”She also remains committed to the legalisation of drugs and an end to the racist stop and search laws that she says are creeping back, since the recent rise in violent crime in London. Her famous photograph of the Clash that adorned their debut single White Riot – the band with their backs turned, their hands up against a wall – was recently repurposed by Release for a campaign against a law that it says makes black youth eight times more likely to be searched.It’s a coming together of all of Coon’s interests – punk, politics, painting – and a reminder that she’s managed to be present at so many countercultural moments. She says her political commitment is what led the punks to adopt her, but you suspect that her inbuilt ability to offend might have helped too. “There I was, the offensive hippy, arguing with Joe Strummer,” she laughs. “But actually there was this wonderful dialogue between the generations taking place. ‘Caroline you failed, you boring hippy.’ ‘No Joe, this is how it really was.’ ‘Well we’re going to do things differently.’” How does she compare those legendary movements to today’s generation? “I love this generation,” she says. “They may have to fight a war again. But as I see it, young people are very active and it’s just the establishment that refuses to recognise that. They like to say they’re apathetic and not getting engaged, but that’s never true. The next 10 years will be fascinating and it probably needs a Putin and a Trump to make people sit up and realise the fight isn’t over.”She pauses and adds: “I just really hope I’m still around to see it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4bdadb22cbdea0ab3d59d00b8420486c7b6aa4/0_334_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b96e3d8d509d8f0311d0bdcf27e4f4c","title":"museum of pizza eggs ice cream alternative museums too far","story":"As New York prepares to welcome the Museum of Pizza, it will join similar pop-ups aimed more at inspiring Instagram selfies than spreading knowledgeAmerica’s first pizzeria opened at 32 Spring Street in New York City in 1905. It was founded by Italian pizza maker Gennaro Lombardi, who sold each slice for five cents. The Museum of Pizza, opening this fall in New York, may or may not acknowledge this piece of history, and there’s a reason why.It’s a selfie museum. Rather than hanging photos on a wall and outlining the chronological history of pizza, it’s a tourist-aiming pop-up space fit for a digital-savvy generation, featuring a pizza beach, a pizza cave and several funhouse spots to pose and celebrate pizza.Call it the Kusama effect. Since Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Room exhibition has taken off (the recent Los Angeles opening of her show at The Broad sold out their 50,000 tickets in less than two hours), it has fueled a debate around selfie-friendly art.Although Kusama’s artworks were not necessarily made for the smartphone (many were made in the 1960s), it’s still part of the “made-for-Instagram” exhibits, or “selfie factories”.It was partly propelled by the Museum of Ice Cream, which launched in New York in 2016 and tapped into a serious demand. They sold more than 300,000 tickets priced at $18 in the first five days of its opening in 2016, resulting in a $5.4m haul. It has since traveled to Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco, where they almost doubled their ticket price to $38, and sold out six months’ worth of tickets in less than two hours.Meanwhile the “real museums” are struggling to pay the bills. The Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield is auctioning off 13 artworks, including classics by American painter Norman Rockwell, to meet their $55m debt. La Salle University in Philadelphia is also selling 46 artworks to raise roughly $10m, which will go towards funding new teaching initiatives.Artnet critic Ben Davis has warned that the new pop-up museums are contrived to feed our vanity. “It is an attraction that quite literally aspires to be the visual equivalent of junk food,” he writes. “It is a very, very serious force to be reckoned with, rivaling the popularity of actual museums in any city it lands in.”While going to museums is supposed to be fun – as well as educational – are pop-up, photo-op museums the new Disneyland of the art world? “We see an opportunity to add new layers of playfulness to the current art, food and learning experience,” said Kareem Rahma, founder of the Museum of Pizza. “We love how the experiential aspects of a children’s science museum and the zany fun quality of Pee Wee’s Playhouse makes learning fun.”The Museum of Pizza aims to balance Instagram selfies with the history of pizza. “Our visitors will learn more about their relationship with food, pizza, art and walk away with some really great memories and photos,” said Rahma. “People want to learn and take selfies so we’re creating an opportunity to do both simultaneously.”As museums adapt to suit a younger generation, it’s not always seen as the answer. “We’ve noticed more iPads and museums apps, but we think it only keeps younger people staring at their phones instead of experiencing the museum itself,” said Rahma. “We feel the gap between looking at art on screen and looking at art on a wall has closed. Artists are great at creating experiences and we think museums are catching on.”A similar approach to photo-friendly “art” is taken in a pop-up called the Egg House, which celebrates the egg. Set in the heart of Manhattan, the exhibition features giant eggs, an oversized egg carton and an egg pool with palm trees.“It aims to provide a quick getaway from the daily life through a fantasized theme-house,” said Biubiu Xu, founder of the Egg House, which runs until 27 June. “People have the need to immerse themselves in another refreshing and inspiring environment the Egg House allows them to do that.”Xu helped stage the exhibition with the smartphone in mind, proving that museums are changing in the face of social media.“Now, the focus is not only on pleasing the visitors but the lens,” said Xu. “We think it’s not necessarily a bad or superficial thing – cameras are better vehicles for communicating things for a shorter attention , which is the case for the current generation.”However, with the rise of selfie-driven museums, the “wow factor” has to be over the top, as the stakes are higher for a digital savvy audience. “The younger generation is definitely harder to please,” said Xu. “They’ve seen everything, so more interactive experiences for all senses is necessary – that means, visual installations, more foods, sounds and even smells.”But this selfie-driven pop-up is not the place to learn about the history of eggs, it’s not even a thoughtful take on agriculture in America, never mind the controversy around animal cruelty and free-range or ethical eggs. “The Egg House is more of a funhouse rather than an exhibit,” said Xu. “The experience aims at providing a fantasy space where guests can play or interact and enjoy themselves it’s not an educational space.”A more traditionally food-centric offering, the Pizza Hut Museum, recently opened in Kansas and honors the half-century-old restaurant chain, yet hasn’t made the same splash on social media. At the same time, selfie museums, like the sold-out Color Factory in San Francisco, which features a confetti room, rainbow-hued photo-ops has garnered more than 100,000 followers on Instagram.

They may be on the rise, but the most Instagrammed museum in America remains the politan Museum of Art followed by the Museum of Modern Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.Maybe it isn’t about the photo, after all? “White box museums forbid you to touch the art, which for me personally inspired the burning desire to touch all the art!” said Rahma. “We’re like the second-coming of the interactive science museum – we’re a fully immersive space with many different experiences, all in one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69dd413dd9f5da9e54c9f2f27fb63f318fbd72d/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=adbedc82cf870715606279dfb7c5f962 1760w","title":"edf plan for tallest uk onshore wind turbines prompts outcry","story":"Isle of Lewis residents protest against new windfarm plan to raise turbine height to 200mEDF Energy has said its plans for two major windfarms on the Isle of Lewis may need to reach heights normally the preserve of turbines at sea, prompting an outcry from local opponents.The French company’s renewables unit said it may need to go higher for the project to be economically viable and win millions of pounds in government subsidies. Kerry MacPhee, who heads community liaison, told locals that one of the windfarms could be 200 metres (650ft) tall, with the other 187 metres, up from 150 metres and 145 metres previously.That would be taller than the UK’s largest existing onshore turbine (193.5 metres) and be on a par with some of the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines, which are 60 metres taller than the London Eye.MacPhee said the potential changes were designed to increase the projects’ chances of winning future auctions for low-carbon electricity and unlock “substantial benefits for Lewis”.EDF said it was likely, but not guaranteed, that fewer turbines would be needed than the original 36 planned. Bigger turbines would also require a new application for planning approval, allowing opponents a chance to air their opinions.Critics remain unimpressed, however. Four crofting groups have been battling EDF’s proposal, arguing that local people would benefit more if the island’s wind resource was harnessed by community-owned turbines.Rhoda MacKenzie, a spokesperson for the crofters, said: “It’s going to have a detrimental effect on tourism. The largest wind turbines in the UK? I hardly think that’s going to bring people here.”Calum Macdonald, a former MP who backs an expansion of community-owned wind power, said the turbine size was staggering. EDF has said there would be no case for more community windfarms without a new power cable to the mainland. The estimated £780m investment needed for such an interconnector would only be justified by electricity generation on the scale proposed by EDF.After several years of not backing support for any onshore windfarms, the government last year threw its weight behind schemes built on remote islands such as Lewis. Wind power developers fighting in auctions for government subsidies across Europe are increasingly dependent on scale to win contracts by bidding with the lowest subsidy price. The next UK auction is scheduled for spring 2019.Will Collins, the project manager for EDF’s Lewis wind power venture, said: “We want to assess the potential for us to consider using larger turbines in order to make the projects as competitive as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ee17120cd3ec1cba64ccd097f8d9a73246e80f4/0_205_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b598201c81182fbdf600e93c5cc56a0","title":"uk construction sector bounces back after beast from east","story":"MarkitCips PMI shows return to growth in April following slump caused by wintry MarchThe UK construction industry has recovered from the disruption caused by March’s wintry weather, returning to growth last month. The MarkitCips UK construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 52.5 last month, up from 47 in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 50.5.Tim Moore, the associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the report, said: “A rebound in construction activity was pretty well inevitable after snowfall resulted in severe disruptions on-site during March. “Housebuilding led the way, with growth in April among the strongest seen over the past two and a half years. However, the picture was less positive in other areas of construction, with commercial building and civil engineering work rising only marginally.”The barometer of economic activity slumped to 47 last month from 51.4 in February, placing the industry below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction.The troubles caused by the “beast from the east” in March had a particularly heavy impact on civil engineering projects, according to the survey of more than 170 construction firms, which is watched by the Bank of England to gauge what is happening at grassroots level in the economy. The fall in civil engineering activity, which includes work on roads and bridges, suffered the biggest monthly downturn in five years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac31d6fcb265f63f247b58568cbde9e1da7b168/0_331_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41cd1cbc4bbb97b9ddcd0a4885d4852f","title":"tsb questions mps it meltdown eurozone economy uk construction business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, including a parliamentary hearing on TSB’s banking woes and a new healthcheck on Europe’s economy Several TSB customers are tweeting their unhappiness that the bank has billed them their usual monthly charge, despite the disruption of the last 12 days.Although some of TSB’s current accounts are free, it charges £9.95 per month for its Silver account, and £8.95month for its ‘select’ option (no longer available).TSB wrote to customers this week, promised to waive overdraft fees for March and April and promising that no-one will be left ‘out of pocket’.But still, charging account fees when people haven’t had the usual service clearly rankles with some customers.We’d like to hear from TSB customers who are still suffering from the IT problems. You can get in touch anonymously here.Back to TSB, and writer Michelle Davies is still having problems with her bank account:Better news: UK construction sector returned to growth in April, as builders returned to work after the ‘Beast from the East’ disrupted activity in March.A quick economic newsflash: Growth across the eurozone’s factories has slowed to a 13-month low.Data firm Markit reports that activity across Europe’s manufacturers cooled in April, with growth slowing in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece.It’s due to a drop in new order growth, meaning firms took on fewer new staff.Firms reported that new order growth slowed last month, as did new hirings, as the strong growth of 2017 fades.However, at least factories are still expanding. The overall eurozone factory PMI fell to 56.2 in April, from 56.6 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s more than a week since TSB’s chief Paul Pester tweeted that “our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running”...and yet there are still problems.The bank’s service status page warns that customers can’t see their mortgage account via internet banking and the mobile app. Some business customers are still struggling to make payments online - which could be disastrous for a firm which needs to pay suppliers or staff.Replacement debit and credit cards are currently taking a little longer to process too. If customers can’t get online, TSB recommends they try “closing your mobile app fully and then restarting it, or closing your internet browser and trying again”. Advice straight out of The IT Crowd....Reuters has also investigated the TBS crisis -- and confirmed that rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication were to blame.“There wasn’t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren’t properly scoped, so it wasn’t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn’t work,” said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline.A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing.Some background: TSB’s IT meltdown was created because the bank moved from its old technology at Lloyds Bank (who sold it in 2013) onto a new system created by current owner Sabadell.Insiders have told us that the team working on the migration were set unrealistically tight deadlines that didn’t acknowledge the challenge of unpicking TSB out of Lloyds’ sprawling network of legacy systems.My colleague Sam Gibbs wrote about the mess on Saturday:By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery.“The time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,” the insider said. “I thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.”To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control – and therefore a full understanding – of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier.By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. “It was unbelievable – hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,” the insider continued. “Senior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.”MPs must ask Pester why the bank didn’t heed these warning signs, and instead plunged on into the current mess.Some TSB customers are fuming this morning after it emerged that the bank had failed to execute their standing orders yesterday.The blunder affected important bills, such as monthly rent payments, set to be paid at the start of the new month.Scientist Stacey Bell found herself caught up in the mess, when her rent found its way back into her account:TSB says the issue has been fixed - but it has created further anxiety among its customers:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Twelve days ago, TSB pressed the button to switch its 5 million customers onto a shiny new IT platform. Later today, the bank’s top brass will try to explain to MPs why they made such a botch of it.TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings will face parliament’s Treasury committee at 2.30pm today, to answer questions about why millions of customers were locked out of their internet and mobile bank services for days.They’ll be accompanied by Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of TSB’s parent company, Sabadell, which oversaw the move onto the Proteo4UK platform.Pester - who took personal control of the mess nearly a week ago - will be quizzed on what exactly went wrong, and why TSB hasn’t been able to get back online. Was the system tested properly, and why wasn’t there a contingency plan in case gremlins struck? And are customers really going to be properly compensated for their losses, and the inconvenience they have suffered?My colleague Patrick Collinson has helpfully drawn up a list of questions for the MPs to bang over the net to the trio:We’ll be wading through a river of data this morning, with new surveys of the eurozone factory sector and Britain’s builders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa74d0828da201ada3d4d59191b91967e34151b/0_105_4342_2605/master/4342.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b96f2b34419cc0c69e88b88c081366","title":"an open book a photographers love letter to city libraries in pictures","story":"Swiss librarian and photographer Thomas Guignard captures the beauty, symmetry and intricate designs of libraries across the worldTo some they are a sanctuary, to others a place of silent boredom, but to Swiss photographer Thomas Guignard libraries are a thing ofbeauty. Working as a librarian and photographer for the last 12 years, Canada-based Guignard combines his great loves in the Instagram account @concretelibraries. “Libraries are the tangible, physical and often monumental representation of human knowledge,” he says. “They are built to share and make that knowledge accessible, to foster community, to encourage the sharing of ideas and invite everyone to contribute to that trove of knowledge.”Guignard has photographed library buildings across the world, from his current hometown of Toronto to Oxford, UK via Detroit in the US. So far he’s visited 35 libraries and has a bucket list of about 310 that he hopes to visit and photograph in the future. Guignard’s interest in library architecture grew in parallel with his photography practice. Whilst working for the library at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, he was involved in the development of a new learning centre, which opened in 2010. As part of his research, Guignard visited other, photographing unique details of their design, and gradually became fascinated by them.“As I visited those libraries, I took more and more pictures, and became more interested in those spaces for their unique aesthetics,” he says.“I try to use symmetry and pay particular attention to how I align my shots to highlight the sacredness of these spaces.”Guignard sees libraries as symbols of “gathering places for communities”. “They are participatory they can’t exist without users, a community – and, of course, librarians and library workers, who do so much more than just stamp out books.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George TownAsia is growing. Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George Town“Before, there were many fish,” says fisherman Mohd-Ishak Bin Abdul Rahman as he pulls a dried up crab from his net. A few years ago he could just walk out into the surf and pick up crustaceans with his bare hands, he tells me. “Now, nothing.”He blames the palisade of new luxury condominiums that rise on the coastline behind him. Built on 240-acres of land artificially reclaimed from the sea, they are part of the Seri Tanjung Pinang 1 (STP1) project. Started in 2006, it brought a taste of new Asian modernity to what was then a rural area beyond the fringes of George Town, Penang’s only city. It also took away the fish, says Mohd-Ishak.The 72-year-old is the undisputed chief of Tanjong Tokong, a fishing village of 100 houses built by the community a few decades ago. He is also the leader of a movement of fishermen protesting against development projects they claim are destroying the island’s fisheries, and with them their livelihoods.Mohd-Ishak says his family has been fishing the area for at least five generations. As we talk, shirtless fishermen watch cautiously from handmade hammocks, half-broken plastic chairs and pieces of junk that washed up on the shore.The contrast between the village with its shacks built from planks, beams and drift wood and the condos, swimming pools, luxury mall and Irish-themed pub is extreme.Now the second phase of the STP project is in full swing. Dredgers, barges, bulldozers and diggers operated by a local subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) are busy creating 1,000 more acres of land for luxury development. Slated for completion in 15 years, the STP2 development is expected to have an eventual value of $4.4bn.Land reclamation is nothing new in Asia – China, Hong Kong and Japan have been at it since the 19th century – but it has recently reached epidemic proportions. Maritime ecosystems are abruptly transformed as natural islands are artificially conjoined with coastlines, natural shorelines are extended and artificial islands are built from scratch.Cities on China’s coast reclaimed an average of 700 square kilometres of land – that’s about the size of Singapore – from the sea every year from 2006 to 2010 for new houses, industrial zones and ports. The 130 sq km of land that was reclaimed to build the new city of Nanhui was significant enough to reconfigure China’s national map, and the reclaimed land for the Caofeidian economic zone was twice the size of Los Angeles.Concerned these megaprojects were getting out of control and doing irreparable harm to the environment, Beijing stepped in earlier this year and put an end to land reclamation projects that were not spearheaded by central government.Meanwhile, many Asian cities are picking up where China left off. Besides the STP projects on Penang, Malaysia has massive reclamation works under way for the 700,000-person Forest City in Johor the Philippines is reclaiming 1,010 acres from the sea for its New Manila Bay – City of Pearl Cambodia is building a slew of Chinese-financed properties on reclaimed land Dubai has turned reclamation into an art form and Sri Lanka is building a new financial district on the dredged and deposited land of Colombo International Financial City. Around a quarter of modern-day Singapore was open sea when the nation state came into existence in 1955.Apart from acting as geopolitical flash points – reclamation in the South China Sea is repeatedly bringing the region to the brink of conflict – sourcing the sand is a major problem. Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam have already banned the export of sand, with reports of a multibillion dollar black market run by organised crime syndicates. Some of Indonesia’s Riau Islands have mysteriously disappeared – loaded on to barges and shipped to nearby Singapore, reports suggest. The verdant, hilly island of Penang has been gripped by a development boom since the historic centre of George Town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2008. As tourists poured in from all over the world, so too did prospective property buyers looking to take advantage of the Malaysia My Second Home programme, and floods of east Asian real estate speculators.“Penang has this obsession with wanting to become like Hong Kong and Singapore,” explains Andrew Ng Yew Han, a local film-maker who has documented Penang’s development.The state government’s crosshairs soon fell upon the other natural feature hemming in their ambitions: the sea. Taking a trick from the playbooks of their model cities, Hong Kong and Singapore, Penang launched several large-scale reclamation initiatives – many strategically placed in prime locations.This ability to home in on high-value sections of cities to reclaim land for new development often produces incredible profits. Research from Ocean University of China professor Liu Hongbin found that land reclamation in China can produce a 10- to 100-fold profit.“If you are confident that you can sell the properties at a high price, which is likely the case at the fringe of large coastal cities or in popular coastal tourism destinations, reclaiming the land from scratch could potentially be more profitable than building on extremely expensive existing land,” explains Matthias Bauer, an urban designer who has worked on reclamation projects in China. However, there is a lot more at stake with these projects than the money that is invested in them. Not only are the fishermen of Tanjong Tokong banned from entering what was once an extremely productive fishing ground but there are now fewer fish in the waters near their village. Mohd-Ishak claims his catches have halved since development began.Walking with him down the beach, another fisherman calls me over to his small house. His name is Haron Din, and his torso and legs are covered in the traditional tattoos that many fishermen in south-east Asia once wore. At his feet lie piles of torn up old nets. He pulls out a dried up crab and explains it was dead long before it got tangled in his net. “The mud from the project suffocates them,” he says.Holding a shiny new white net next to one of the 40 or so damaged ones littering the beach, Din complains that mud from the nearby reclamation area is killing the local marine life and doing irreparable damage to their fishing equipment.The fishermen must travel further out to sea to find fish, which drastically increases both the cost of petrol and the dangers of the job. Unable to make a living in their sheltered bay, they now have to cross a busy shipping lane and contend with higher waves. There have already been a few deaths, Mohd-Ishak says.Mageswari Sangaralingam, a research officer for Friends of the Earth Malaysia, says the thousands of sq km of land reclaimed across coastal Asia has meant the annihilation of mangroves, wetlands and reefs – destroying the habitats and breeding grounds for fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, plants and other marine life. In addition, the new cities, transport hubs and industrial zones built on the new land inevitably create added pollution and waste, he says.“The multimillion-ringgit fisheries sector here on which thousands depend is being traded off for development,” says Sangaralingam. “Fish are being wiped out, and the fishermen will soon be too as they lose fishing grounds.”“You have this development and yet people are losing their jobs,” adds film-maker Han. “You have reclamation which promised development, but you have fishermen who are losing their livelihoods, looking for second jobs … You build so many buildings here but in the end it doesn’t belong to us, it will be bought up by other people and foreigners.”I visit Straits Quay – the high-end shopping mall surrounded by luxury condos overlooking the fishing village. On three trips here I’ve never seen anyone actually shopping in its luxury boutiques. The hallways are bare wind tunnels and even the giant atrium that acts as an opulent entranceway to the mall appears desolate, echoing the caws of resident crows and little else. If it wasn’t for a few stragglers slipping in and out to pick up groceries at the small supermarket – and the yacht owners drinking on the patio of the Irish-themed pub – the place could be called a ghost mall.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d701fce77715f908c8609a69e5c296606126b4/529_1010_2312_1387/master/2312.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5f83b9ae8c5a597a0c49fd577a2fdc","title":"black tories windrush conservatives government british","story":"Not long ago, black Conservatives would invoke the name Windrush in a positive context, as evidence of how far the Tories had come since the bad old days of overt racism. “When Empire Windrush arrived at the docks of Tilbury … there was a clear split. Labour embraced migrants … the Tories, not so much … Things are changing,” said one young black Tory in safer times, in 2015.Most of the black Tories I know are of African heritage and were raised with values that emphasise enterprise, faith, family and social conservatism. (For me, the conundrum has never been why there are black Conservatives at all, but why there aren’t more.) They have adopted a worldview in which racism – both within British society and the Tory party in particular – is largely a thing of the past. This has enabled them to create a mental ide between the party’s social and economic values, which they like, and its dodgy history on race. Their emphasis has been on personal responsibility and enterprise, rather than structural barriers to advancement.The last two Conservative prime ministers both made bold statements about their commitments toward eradicating these barriers. David Cameron, branding it “disgraceful” that a young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she was invited to job interviews, for example and Theresa May, in her stance on stop and search, and the launch of her race audit.But the struggle to reconcile those warm words with the Windrush scandal has, perhaps not surprisingly, sent my black Tory acquaintances into a bout of soul-searching. “Better inside the tent looking out than outside the tent looking in,” one – a successful banker – told me. He then, somewhat mournfully, sent me the  article that Margaret Thatcher’s former speechwriter Derek Laud wrote on why the treatment of the Windrush generation made him glad he had left the party. Another black Tory told me, as if trying to convince herself: “Imagine how much worse it would be if there were no black people in the party.”I can’t imagine that, actually. How much worse could it be? We have a foreign secretary who has a long and distinguished track record of the crudest racist remarks – and the comments he published as editor of the Spectator about Caribbean people “multiplying like flies” are particularly painful to read in the light of current events. We have a litany of racist comments by activists, councillors and MPs. The last Conservative London mayoral campaign was so toxic that other Tories sought to distance themselves from it. And even when alerted to the Windrush injustices, May’s instinct was not to meet Caribbean leaders.Yes, there has been racism in the Labour party too, and it is currently – as has been widely reported – battling antisemitism in its ranks. The left has had a lazy\u0026nbsptendency to caricature black Tories as sellouts, while enjoying a historical sense of entitlement towards\u0026nbspthe black vote – an attitude that has its own imperialist connotations.Yet on the right there is a tendency to manipulate black conservatism to paper over a history of appalling racism and discrimination. Even the most conservative Conservatives have shocking stories of treatment within their own party, both at national and local level. Most do not speak about them publicly, although the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi’s rare account of the prejudice she experienced as a Muslim in the party is sobering. When a young black man close to me went to enquire about local party membership not long ago, they assumed he was there to deliver their pizza.But politics should be about policy, not the behaviour of rogue bigots, who can be found on all sides of the political spectrum. And that’s why the Conservative track record on immigration is so hard to reconcile. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, for example, has a well-known backstory, beloved by Conservatives, of hard-earned success after his father’s arrival in the UK with just £1 to his name. Yet this story could not happen today, because Javid’s own party would not let his father into the country.The families of the MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Sam Gyimah and Adam Afriyie, one or both of whose parents came, as my mother did, from Ghana having been British subjects under the empire, would – had they achieved the unlikely feat of making it into the country under today’s immigration policies – have found themselves in the nightmare of the Tories’ own hostile environment.It’s this hypocrisy that black Conservatives, on both sides of the Atlantic, struggle to shake off. The conviction of Bill Cosby for aggravated indecent assault against one woman – though he has more than 50 accusers – is bitter justice for a man whose message was, “Do as I say, not as I do”. Cosby, like black British Tories, blamed absent black fathers, shameless single mothers, black culture and rap music – not structural racism and injustice – for America’s creation of a black underclass. Substitute Cosby’s critique of “rap” for British Tories’ critique of “grime” and it all sounds very familiar.In the House of Commons on his first day in his new role, Javid told his shadow, Diane Abbott, that she did not have a “monopoly” on either being the descendant of migrants, or feeling anger and pain at the way some have been treated. And he’s right. But his party is fast earning itself a reputation for having a monopoly over treating British people of colour as less than British, indeed as less than human. And that will reverberate not just among people like me, who already fundamentally distrust the Tories, but many black and brown Brits who once did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4c1806e9de97e92413a25dd757287d3b882164/0_0_650_391/master/650.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6c86e5cb8713a88041d1d54ad94861c0 1290w","title":"what to do in vancouver a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A multicultural seaport city with thriving arts and culinary scenes, set against the backdrop of a picturesque mountainscape and coast?

I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country. When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed. The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.  Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”. The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.  Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours. Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto. One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13db697d6353b087fe4ad5d71b85ccf6c2ae77a6/0_343_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e9e0fd9ddf93726ab15b04cf5750e9","title":"canada is one of the coolest countries on the planet if you want proof take a look at its festivals","story":"From the glamour of the Toronto International Film Festival to the freewheeling Halifax Pop Explosion, Canada’s erse, culturally dynamic population knows how to party. Get in on the action with our four favourite Canadian festivalsWhen Miguel Zamora Sanchez first arrived in Toronto after moving from his native Mexico, he was immediately struck by the city’s ersity. “The first weekend I was here it was the gay pride parade,” says the student. “And that same day I saw a jazz festival – it was spread out through the entire city.”It may all have been new to Sanchez at the time, but this will come as no surprise to anyone that’s spent much time in the country. Canadians have a long history of celebrating art and culture, resulting in a vibrant, varied, year-round festival calendar up there with the world’s best. Take the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), which began in 1976 and attracted more than 30,000 attendees in its inaugural year. It is now one of the film industry’s highest-profile events (considered by many in Hollywood to be second only to Cannes in terms of headline premiere screenings and star power) and one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world – with almost 400 movies being screened and as many as 480,000 people attending.Piers Handling, director and CEO of TIFF, believes the city’s erse, multicultural population is the spine of the festival’s success. Despite the many A-listers that flock to the city every autumn for the festival – bringing the eyes of the world with them – TIFF thrives because of the people that call Toronto their home all year.“What makes the festival cool is the public,” says Handling. “It’s a very warm, welcoming and erse public. They’re not judgemental. They’re very, very open. They’re not cynical. They’re incredibly curious. So many film-makers have said that it’s the best public to show their film to for the first time.”That openness and cultural savvy isn’t just limited to film, either. Five years ago, Field Trip, an annual summer music festival that hosts approximately 10,000 visitors a day at historic Fort York in downtown Toronto, was launched. While it can be difficult for a new festival to find its footing with so many other competing brands and approaches, Field Trip has thrived because it aims to welcome a broad demographic – not just younger tastemakers.“One of the strengths of the festival is that it’s very community focused,” says Field Trips’s co-director Aaron Miller. “It’s family focused.”Held over two days in June (2-3 June 2018), the festival has brought celebrated acts such as the National and Phoenix – as well as homegrown talents Broken Social Scene and Feist – to Fort York, but still strives to curate a programme that appeals to all ages. “It’s the ersity and the inclusiveness,” Miller says of what makes the festival “cool”. “Those are obviously buzzwords that are associated with Toronto. No place is perfect and this city, like many others, has a lot of work to do. But, ultimately, Toronto does do a pretty good job of celebrating ersity. That ethos is what Field Trip really grabs on to.”Hundreds of miles away from Toronto, the port city of Halifax is also enjoying a flourishing creative movement that hinges on its ersity. Once known as Seattle of the North for its thriving grunge scene in the early 90s, the Nova Scotian capital now prides itself on attracting a wide variety of creative types.“We’re a real hub for artists and left-wing thinkers and people that want to express themselves,” says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion, a multi-day music festival and conference.Boyle describes Halifax as “a melting pot of different perspectives, ideas and communities” and lauds the rich history of the African Nova Scotian community, the strength of its indigenous community and high student population as the main sources of this distinct outlook. “It’s a hub for ideas and music to flourish,” he says. “That’s why we have so many different genres of music. The city has become that place where people can come and speak their mind and push their ideas forward.”And it’s the festival-goers who reap the rewards of this freewheeling, inclusive approach, with an ever-expanding lineup of interesting, critically acclaimed acts.But few festivals can lay claim to the kind of heavy-hitting programme that Festival d’été in Quebec City offers. One of Canada’s largest music festivals, hundreds of artists play at the 11-day festival each year. Celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, it’s played host to the Rolling Stones, Metallica, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga in the past four years alone. But despite the monumental acts that the festival attracts, Luci Tremblay, communications director at Festival d’été, echoes Handling’s belief that the home audience is the most integral part of the festival’s success.“The people of Quebec make Festival d’été cool because the people of Quebec are cool,” she says. “The festival belongs to them, they are defending it, they love it. Summer here is short. It’s not always warm. So the people of Quebec, as soon as it gets warm, they want to get out. So they add that spirit to the festival and that’s what makes it unique.”“The artists are discovering something,” Tremblay says of the many big names who have played the festival. “When they arrive, they discover how big the festival is and they see the huge stage we have on the Plains of Abraham, which can hold up to 100,000 people – I remember Billy Joel saying that he’d been doing this job for 50 years and he wondered why he’d never come here. It’s always a discovery like that.”For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5360ff6a6b518993a96f4131fd3f170f5a2c467c/19_0_6106_3664/master/6106.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9a36e2518b264984f6efaf4e107470a","title":"air pollution inequality widens between rich and poor nations","story":"Rich cities have improved, but pollution in poorer countries is still rising and kills 7 million people a year globally, WHO data revealsPollution inequality between the world’s rich and poor is widening, according to the latest global data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) which shows that 7 million people – mostly in developing nations – die every year from airborne contaminants.Overall, nine in 10 people on the planet live with poor, even dangerous, air, says the WHO report, which is considered the most comprehensive collection of global air quality data. But levels of contamination vary widely depending on government actions and financial resources.But these gains were set against a worsening trend in other regions.Delhi and Cairo are by far the most polluted mega-cities in the world with average PM10 levels more than 10 times the WHO guidelines. They are followed by Dhaka, Mumbai and Beijing, each with particulate concentrations about five times the recommended level.In terms of household air pollution, which contributed to 3.8m deaths, the gap is also wide because families in poorer nations are more dependent on burning wood, coal and kerosene for cooking and heating.Overall, the authors said the global annual death toll of 7 million is largely unchanged from the previous 2016 air pollution report by the WHO, despite growing awareness of the problem and government promises of action.Reducing these risks depends on public awareness and political will, as well as income. The authors of the report praised China, which has tightened pollution controls in the wake of “airpocalypse” scandals, public protests and health concerns.“One of the reasons for that, is the health argument is strongly presented and citizens felt the link between air pollution and their own health,” said Dr Maria Neira, director of public health at WHO. “We’d like to see the same movement now in India, which is a country of particular concern.”There are signs of progress from specific projects, such as India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme which has provided 37 million women living below the poverty line with free liquified petroleum gas connections, and Mexico City, which has committed to cleaner vehicle standards. More cities are also measuring air quality, which is pushing the subject up the political agenda.But there is much to be done, even in wealthy nations with relatively progressive policies. The new data reveals 49 towns and cities in the UK – ranging from London and Manchester to Prestonpans and Eccles – are at or over WHO standards for PM2.5. Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said this showed the need for more research and stronger policies.“As more air quality data becomes available, we are uncovering a deeply concerning number of seemingly quaint, fresh aired places across the UK with dangerously polluted air,” she said.But the overall picture is clear. WHO says the threat remains enormous across the globe with the worst impacts hitting the poor.“Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalised people bear the brunt of the burden,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO. “It is unacceptable that over 3 billion people – most of them women and children – are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don’t take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development.”As well as governments, WHO are encouraging iniduals to do more to reduce air pollution with a campaign to promote greater use of public transport and bicycles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e3d5218286e521b529de15a9642e962b039c64/0_2048_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd2ade195137cde7d6f1278f0b186f1","title":"how the coming of age film came of age with boyhood","story":"Its portrait of a young man is gripping – but the heart of the film is Patricia Arquette’s long-suffering motherMy favourite coming-of-age film is not really a coming-of-age film at all. It is not the traditionally scripted, bittersweet lite-sexy dramedy about the teenager who finds out about love and the meaning of friendship over one unforgettable summer.It’s not really scripted at all, but it does conform to the maleness of the genre and it does more than any film to show what coming of age actually does look like in the real world: it is gradual, cumulative, but with key moments whose significance is appreciated afterwards rather than at the time. The film is Richard Linklater’s masterpiece Boyhood: an extraordinary, unique, time-lapse portrait of a young man called Mason growing up from primary school to his first day of college. Linklater worked over 12 years with the actor Ellar Coltrane, along with a cast including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke playing his estranged parents, shooting for a couple of weeks every year.Only the loosest storyline could be envisaged because of the difficulty in guaranteeing cast-members’ availability. Even putting Coltrane at the centre of the film was a risk. Linklater did not want to look too far ahead for fear of disappointment and chaos, and his directorial concern is actually very close to the way we think about our own lives, and our own reluctance to imagine our future in any detail. So the film, like life, rolls along, with Coltrane periodically getting bigger. His life is not given the retrospectively organised shape that other stories get.This is not to say that the film doesn’t have its coming-of-agey moments: at 16, Mason drinks and smokes weed for the first time at 17, he has a girlfriend and at 18 he painfully breaks up with her, wins a photography prize and gets a college scholarship. These are important, emotional moments, but not foregrounded and privileged as definitive. It is gripping and moving in a unique way. In fact, the really climactic coming-of-age moment is assigned to Patricia Arquette as Mason’s long-suffering mother she gives a wonderfully moving speech as Mason heads off to college and she confronts her empty-nest sadness and grasps the reality of life’s terrible shortness.Boyhood is the film in which the coming-of-age genre itself actually grows up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c85c4cff78b2165dfda780ba631ac1bde6b9148/14_150_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea5e09078ff93c68314ab87649e8a15","title":"harry kane fa tweet england spurs","story":"• Tottenham striker says other nations would not belittle players• Kane will not leave social media despite actions of minorityHarry Kane has said the Football Association was silly to poke fun at his performance in Tottenham’s FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United and questioned why people feel the need to mock England players before the World Cup.The striker was kept quiet by United’s Chris Smalling at Wembley and after the game, which United won 2-1, the official FA Cup account tweeted: “What’s that in your pocket, Chris?” and linked to an unrelated video of the defender saying: “Harry Kane.”The tweet was deleted and the FA apologised to Tottenham and United “for any offence caused”. Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham’s manager, branded the game’s governing body an embarrassment last week. Kane is relaxed about the issue but he pointed out it was an odd way for the FA to treat one of its own.“The FA tweet was a silly tweet,” Kane said. “We all know that. I talked to the gaffer about it and all we said was: ‘Would other countries do that to their players?’ Probably not.“It is something that has gone. Two weeks ago now or whatever – I am over it. The gaffer may have said I am sad but I am focused. I am a guy that gets over things. If it happened, it happened. I move on and look forward to the next game and that is all I worry about.”Kane, who scored his 38th goal of the season in Tottenham’s 2-0 win over Watford on Monday, added that England players receive too much flak at times.“It’s strange,” he said. “Maybe it’s a mentality thing. It is easier nowadays maybe to banter England players or take the mickey out of the England players. So if we don’t do well in the World Cup, then they can write and say: ‘We told you so.’ But that is maybe a weaker mentality.“It is what it is. We are focusing on what we have got to do. We have got to go with the mindset and belief we can do it. We try to win everything we go into. The World Cup is no different.”Kane has been the butt of a few jokes since fighting to be credited with a goal that brushed off him against Stoke on 7 April. However he has no plans to step away from social media.“On social media you get a few people who don’t see eye to eye and it is being a fan and having an opinion,” he said. “I will always engage with my fans. It is just a small number of fans who maybe go over the mark but that is just life. You cannot get too down about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76e0449ea140341cd5c32ba06938621c46ef8ec1/0_20_3456_2073/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d0550f32bfa3a918139192317f0a63","title":"burton albion championship nigel clough","story":"Nigel Clough’s side looked down and out but three wins have put them within sight of survival in a league where the odds are stacked firmly against themIt was last month, two days after a 5-0 humbling by Hull on home turf that left Burton marooned at the bottom of the Championship and eight points adrift of safety with four games remaining, that Ben Robinson, the club’s chairman, penned an open letter to supporters. In short, he says, it was a message that served as a reality check, a reminder of the challenge given their extraordinary journey from the Unibond League to here.In the last line, he referenced the need to generate another miracle if Burton had any hope of preserving their status. The manager, Nigel Clough, sounded resigned to their fate. “We are nearly done now, I’d say,” he said, after that loss extended their winless run to nine. It looked as though they had left themselves too much to do, the writing on the wall.But, three straight wins later, Burton have earned a fighting chance before heading into the final game of the season against play-off chasing Preston at Deepdale on Sunday. That they have taken it to the wire is nothing short of incredible. “We go there thinking it’s still possible to survive, create a great escape and another massive miracle,” Robinson says. “Realistically, you wouldn’t have expected us to win those three games, at home to Derby, away to Sunderland and at home to Bolton – three tough games. But the team came good, produced nine points and three great performances.”It is not entirely in their own hands and come Sunday lunchtime they will have one eye on the teams they find themselves sandwiched in between. Bolton entertain Nottingham Forest while they could do with neighbours Derby, who host Barnsley, doing them a favour. Mathematically a point could prove sufficient with Bolton, who go into the weekend occupying 23rd, one point and one place below them,and Barnsley ahead of Albion thanks only to a far superior goal difference.If they were to pull it off, would it taste even sweeter than after staying up in their maiden season with one game to spare last April? “I think so, because people say it’s the second season that’s the biggest challenge and that’s why I think if we managed to do it this season, it would be an even bigger miracle.”Burton faced Manchester United in the EFL Cup in September but even in the second tier most weeks, Robinson says, it is David v Goliath battle. Of the gulf in financial muscle, Clough said it can be “demoralising at times when you go into games like Wolves knowing deep down you can’t compete” and that his players are not “daft” in recognising the chasm.Burton operate with comfortably the smallest budget in the ision, a modest wage bill of around £8m and the average attendance at their Pirelli Stadium, opened in 2005, is just below 4,700. Robinson admits to being disappointed at their gates but one the biggest frustrations this season was the anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained by club-record signing Liam Boyce, a £500,000 arrival from Ross County, against Shrewsbury Town five weeks into pre-season. He scored a 90th-minute winner after Darren Bent had equalised at former club Sunderland two weeks ago.Robinson describes Sunderland’s plight as “really sad” and believes Burton have been able to punch above their weight on the pitch because of his manager. “I think that’s his skill, if you look at the spirit of the team,” he says. “He has worked within limited resources to get the best results. It’s not how much you spend it’s how you spend. That’s why Nigel Clough’s been successful.”As a club, they are prepared for “both scenarios” but securing a third consecutive season in the second tier would mean a lot for Robinson, who has been involved with the club for 34 years, across two spells. “I’m 73 in September, so I enjoy every day of my life but I’d be dead chuffed,” he says. “And I’d be particularly pleased for Nigel and the players. You could say ‘it’s just another game’ but it’s obviously a game on which so much depends and we are going there with a great chance.“Preston need a result to get into the play-offs, they have everything to play for and so we have we. We are looking forward to it. If we survive, fine. If we don’t, then we will look at next season with the same approach we have had all these years, and deal with it accordingly. Stranger things have happened.”• Just the thought of another team pulling off some last-day heroics will be of deep concern to Paul Clement and his Reading side. This time last year they were gearing up for the play-offs but, after an embarrassing 4-0 home defeat by Ipswich, they still need a point to guarantee safety. “We’re now in a position we wanted to avoid, which is having to go to Cardiff and get a result,” the manager said. “If we don’t, it’s in the lap of the gods.”• Barnet have their own big dreams after taking their fight for League Two survival to the last day. Martin Allen’s men must beat relegated Chesterfield to stay afloat in the Football League but will still most likely to rely on results elsewhere, namely Morecambe’s trip to Coventry.• Morecambe received a mini-boost of sorts before Sunday’s showdown with confirmation that the club’s sale, to Bond Group Investments Limited, a London-based firm, has gone through after months of uncertainty. “We are very pleased to confirm this transaction and look forward to a period of sustained stability and growth within the club,” said chairman Peter McGuigan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb7d8b12227c53dcb1b68d4a94b47e13becb5eda/0_223_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf185556ce8f092e8fdf54899861623","title":"chesterfield relegation from football league","story":"A saga of budget overruns on the stadium, a boardroom walkout and a run of unsuccessful managerial appointments has seen the Spireites relegatedIn the rain at Chesterfield’s Proact Stadium on Saturday, home supporters still stunned by the club’s first relegation from the Football League sat mostly in glum resignation, watching Wycombe win 2-1 and deliriously celebrate promotion all over the pitch.Wycombe’s manager, Gareth Ainsworth, broke for a moment from his players’ jubilation, their gleeful calls for the board to “send us to Vegas”, and expressed sympathy for the Spireites: “It’s very sad,” he said. “You stand in this stadium and the thought that this club is going to be in the National League next year is frightening. It’s got to be a real wake-up call for all clubs it can happen to anyone. This is a huge club with a huge history.”Relegation was never in the brochure when Chesterfield boldly moved in 2010 from Saltergate, their atmospheric home since 1871, and took aim for the Championship in their new 10,000-seat stadium.Founder members of the Third Division (North) in 1921 and solidly in the Football League throughout the 97 years since, Chesterfield overcame a crisis in 2001 caused by Darren Brown, then 29, who was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison for fraudulent trading. The supporters trust, the CFSS, took over a club in financial ruins, had to put it into administration, then passed its running to four wealthy local supporters who steered it back to solvency .Needing millions to bridge the gap between selling Saltergate and building the new stadium, in 2009 the shareholders ceded majority ownership to Dave Allen, the Sheffield casino owner, as did the CFSS, which had formed a community-centred vision for the future termed “the club’s the hub”.The fruits of that approach, The Hub, excellent facilities built into the stadium’s east stand in which the Chesterfield FC Community Trust, a registered charity, runs school and social inclusion projects and programmes for people with disabilities, shone on Saturday like a beacon in the gloom. To Chesterfield’s proud history as the world’s fourth oldest professional club, formed in 1866, can be added a modern distinction, as the originators of walking football, the ambulant form of the game drawing in crowds of mostly senior citizens nationwide.How all this progress stumbled as low as dropping out of the EFL is a dismal saga of budget overruns on the stadium, a boardroom walkout by Allen and latterly a run of unsuccessful managerial appointments. Allen, an archetype of a blunt-talking Yorkshireman who previously ran Sheffield Wednesday in a difficult period financially, became disillusioned after the initial £4m he was asked to provide for the stadium steadily increased.“I only went in to invest money my ambition was to get into the Championship and flog it,” he said. “But they wanted more money within months. I’ve put a hell of a lot of money in. I’m very sad and I also feel very bitter.”Promoted in 2014 under Paul Cook’s shrewd management, Chesterfield made the play-off semi-final for promotion to the Championship as recently as three years ago but lost to Preston, then Cook took up an offer to manage Portsmouth. Chesterfield sold players, including Sam Clucas to Hull City for £1.3m, in an effort to balance the books, but Allen said he agrees with many at the club that the subsequent departure of Paul Mitchell, who headed player recruitment under Cook, was a severe loss.Allen’s disenchantment escalated in November 2016, when he asked the other directors to set aside repayment of their own loans and waive interest. Some at the club say the directors were prepared to do that except for one loan from a director’s company Allen responds that “collectively” they did not agree. He immediately resigned from the board, and has barely been to the stadium since.The other directors soon also resigned, leaving only the long-serving Mike Warner as the chairman, John Croot, the chief executive of the community trust, and Allen’s long-term associate, Ashley Carson, on the board.Carson holds the historic position in Sheffield of assay master, the silver hallmarking authority, but at Chesterfield, following the disappointments of relegation back to League Two in 2016 and four managers since Cook, he has been the focus of criticism. At the Wycombe defeat, there were calls of “We want Carson out” from a group of supporters who mustered a protest.Allen insists he is standing by Carson: “He is a good, straight businessman I’ve known him a long time. I don’t think the bad decisions were down to him. I am going to take a more active part now in trying to put things right, and we need to appoint the right manager to bounce back up again.”Ian Evatt, the captain appointed as caretaker after last week’s departure as manager of former striker Jack Lester, said on Saturday: “For this club to be out of the Football League is an absolute travesty. Personally I’m devastated.”Evatt’s view was that the players themselves must face responsibility: “Football is sometimes about self-analysing, about going home, looking in the mirror and asking yourself: ‘Have I done enough for this football club?’ Clearly the answer is no, and I’m included in that.“You can blame all the people you want to blame, you can blame off the pitch, but when it comes down to it, the players on the pitch have not been good enough this season. Simple as that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399a33eda2153f89d50e67ffcf36dae9adcfe177/24_0_3403_2043/master/3403.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ed652d917c7eef14a781d72f0e2580","title":"which champions have had only one player in the pfa team of the year","story":"Plus: taking the boat to the World Cup, more teams getting relegated after one game and injuries inflicted by officials. Mail us your answers or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Which teams have won the league and had the fewest number of players in the PFA team of the year?” asks Chris Lambert. “Or vice versa, not winning the league (or indeed suffering relegation) and having the most number of players in?”Just the sort of question for one of our loveable army of anoraks. Here’s Pete Tomlin: “Having been previously called an anorak by yourselves, this question is very exciting for me as it gives me another chance to look back at the archives. To answer the first part of the question, there have been six teams that have won the league but only had one player in the PFA team of the year. These were:“As for the teams that had the most players in the team of the year but did not win the title that season, there a couple with five representatives:“Five players have been chosen for the team of the year even though their team was relegated in the same season. They are:“A few other statistics that may be of interest: in 2006-07 Manchester United had eight players in the team of the year, which is the most ever. Unsurprisingly, they also have the highest total amount of players in teams of the year since they began in 1973-74, with 97. Liverpool are second with 68 and Arsenal third with 66.” Pete, again, thank you.“Who were the last team to travel to a World Cup by boat?” tweets Jim Hilton.This Joy of Six from 2010 can start us off:Problem was, the two-week cruise wasn’t particularly conducive to athletic improvement. So with little training done, Italy rolled off the boat on to dry land at São Paolo and, knackered and out of condition, immediately lost their first game to a Sweden side who were without all their best players in Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. The result effectively meant Italy fell at the very first hurdle, 90 minutes of red-faced effort ending their 16-year possession of Coupe Jules Rimet. A farce, you would say, though one which could be put down to an unfortunate and unavoidable combination of circumstances. Until you realise the players were then allowed to fly back home.Apart that is from striker Benito Lorenzi, who preferred a month-long return by boat which only just got him back in time for pre-season training.The Fifa museum site also features a history of squad journeys to the finals and recalls a boat-based element of South Korea’s 1954 odyssey: “On 10 June, they took a long train ride from Seoul to Busan, where they boarded a ship for Japan. In Tokyo, they found that the plane wasn’t big enough – so 12 players and the coach flew to Zurich via Calcutta (where there was a delay for propeller repairs) and Italy. The other nine members went to Bangkok to catch a flight to Europe on 13 June. That aircraft was also too small, and the story goes that two players would have been left behind if an English couple hadn’t given up their seats.” Knackered, they lost their opening match 9-0 to Hungary and their second to Turkey, 7-0. Then it was back on to the long plane home.Reader Alex von Fintel points out that “the German team at the 2014 World Cup travelled to and from every match by boat. ‎It was just a ferry across a bay, which was the only way to and from the hotel, but they did use a boat.”Last week we looked at teams both getting relegated at the end of the same match. But there’s another …“In the Danish Superliga, both Randers FC and Esbjerg fB were relegated after drawing the last match of the 2010-11-season,” notes Jonas Okholm. “The match ended 2-2. With a win, either team could have stayed up. But Esbjerg equalised in the 89th minute and so, both teams went down.” Lucky old Aalborg stayed up despite losing.“Has a player in a top league ever been injured by a linesman’s flag?” asked Chris Brooks in 2010. “How about a fourth official’s board? A whistle?”• Take a trip to the font of nerdvana in our archive.“Has there ever been an occasion where a major team has been disrupted by jury service, with either a manager or a player being called up during the season?” asks James Schofield.“On Sunday FC United’s women’s team won their league with a 10-0 victory against Crewe,” writes Michael Leversha. “A few hours later, five members of the first team won the FA People’s Cup on penalties against Meridien.

Bayern Munich tried so hard to win it. That neither could achieve this apparently shared aim speaks in the first place to Real’s pure champion will and secondly to that nexus of game-management, calamitous Bayern defending and something close to a kind of white-shirted voodoo, the ability to win even while in the process of sputtering and panting like a stalled presidential motorcade.This was a fun, wild, oddly drunken game of football that ended 2-2 at the Bernabéu and 4-3 to Real on aggregate. At the end of which a couple of things seemed clear. Above all this was just a brilliant game. These late-stage encounters are supposed to unwind like a game of chess, a matter of grudging details. This was a more like a seasick game of quoits on the deck of a rum-sodden pirate ship, 95 minutes of half-chances, howlers and defending that seemed to have come undone at the seams like a soggy envelope.This leads on to point two, the ongoing, perhaps misguided conviction that somebody somewhere is finally going to connect in a decisive way with that elegantly presented champion’s glass jaw. Liverpool or Roma will travel to Kiev later this month with a chance to stop Real from making it three in a row. With this in mind Bayern might just have offered an anatomy of how to go about doing it, with a performance that will be picked apart and pored over with interest by either Jürgen Klopp or Eusebio Di Francesco over the next few weeks.For long periods in the second half Bayern were heroic. They thrashed Real 2-2, battered them to a score draw, steamrollered their own way right out of the competition. Albeit at times it was as though Real were actively trying to concede goals, with Thomas Müller left unmarked for pretty much the whole of the second half, constantly hollering for the ball in another traumatically wide open green space while Marcelo ambled back wearing a look of mild curiosity.With the final kick of the game, and with Bayern a kick from the final, Müller eventually got that cross from the left and launched himself, missing by a toenail. As the whistle blew there were spent, crumpled bodies across the turf. Bayern had 22 shots at goal to Real’s nine. They hogged the ball. They reduced Cristiano Ronaldo to 13 completed passes. But for a frankly bonkers error by Sven Ulreich, Jupp Heynckes would now be preparing for a swansong final.Instead Ulreich came up with something genuinely strange, seeming to stop and then simply lie down on the turf as the ball bobbled towards him, a man overcome with weariness, allowing Karim Benzema to score his second of the game.Whoever their opponents later this month Real’s weaknesses here seemed to tessellate intriguingly with the attacking strengths of both Liverpool and Roma. The most telling was the constant weakness Bayern found on the flanks. David Alaba’s willingness to attack the temporary right-back Lucas Vázquez had Real looking at times like a three-legged dog of a team, always listing to one side, exposing a lack of cover for the full-backs.The ball fell the wrong way three or four times. Alaba drove outside where Sadio Mané or Mo Salah can be expected to hare infield. And both Bayern goals came from surges out wide, the second after fine work from the excellent Niklas Süle and a cross that James Rodríguez put away before producing a laughably prim no-celebration-celebration right in front of the delirious away fans.Similarly Bayern only really struggled when they let their high press drop, when Real were able to build and maintain pressure, allowing that high-grade but far from youthful attack to find space. Real lack a little pace these days without Gareth Bale on the pitch. It is possible with a little luck to play a bold high line, to press with the throttle to the floor, as both Liverpool and Roma do at times.Real will be favourites whoever they face but there will still be hope in the familiar sense of brittleness on show here. Should they make it to Kiev Liverpool will surely look to play with a high-pressing sense of risk, to do as much as possible in their own full-throttle red zone against opponents who can look vulnerable and oddly invincible at the same time, and who were winners once again by some shakily enacted ine regal right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f42a799070d2a0b9ef018186d9eb74a5a9f3c3a/0_222_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a46c1a4cd0a1ae7749e05e6335eb7f8","title":"legal watchdog may investigate christian group over alfie evans case","story":"Solicitors Regulation Authority reviewing role of Christian Legal Centre in life-support disputeThe Christian campaign group that acted for the family of Alfie Evans could face an investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), the  has learned.The legal watchdog confirmed it was reviewing the Christian Legal Centre’s role in the high-profile life-support battle that ended with the death of the 23-month-old boy on Saturday, five days after he was removed from a ventilator.Three court of appeal judges criticised the role of supporters who may have “infiltrated or compromised” the legal representation of Alfie’s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James.The high court judge Mr Justice Hayden was particularly critical of the role of Pavel Stroilov, a Russian-born law student who appeared to have taken the lead in representing Alfie’s parents for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC).The judge described Stroilov, who formerly worked for the Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, as a “fanatical and deluded young man” whose legal advice was “inconsistent with the real interests of the parents’ case”.The SRA has not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation but is assessing concerns surrounding the CLC’s involvement. An SRA spokesman said: “We can confirm we will review the information provided and consider if any next steps are appropriate.“Only those authorised by a legal services regulatory such as the SRA are allowed to carry out reserved legal activities, as defined within section 12 of the Legal Services Act 2007, within the English and Welsh legal system.”Tom Evans was presented with an award at Everton football club’s annual end-of-season ceremony, the Dixies, on Tuesday night in his first public appearance since Alfie’s death at 2.30am on Saturday.Receiving the Blueblood award, given to those who “embody the Evertonian spirit”, Evans said he had dreamed his son would follow in Wayne Rooney’s footsteps by playing for the club. “Alfie will always be a part of Everton,” he said.CLC has not yet responded to the SRA’s review of its role but said in a statement on Friday that it rejected the “unfair and detrimental” criticism by judges and commentators. It said that in the three weeks of its involvement, its barrister Paul Diamond “took the case from the high court to the court of appeal to the supreme court and to the European court – and then back again to the high court and to the court of appeal. We can think of no other organisation that would have achieved this in such a short period.”Stroilov was described in court as the legal adviser who had encouraged Alfie’s father to pursue a private prosecution for murder against doctors at Alder Hey children’s hospital, where Alfie was treated for a degenerative neurological condition for 16 months.Hayden also criticised Stroilov after the student gave Evans a letter purporting to be legal advice stating that it would be lawful for him to remove Alfie from Alder Hey – a letter that the hospital’s legal team blamed for causing a highly-charged standoff between Evans, the police and doctors and ignited protests outside. Three court of appeal judges said Stroilov’s letter was “misleading to the extent of giving the father false advice”. has since learned that Alder Hey’s legal team is considering bringing contempt of court proceedings against Stroilov after apparently being met with silence when asked for his legal qualifications.CLC said on Friday: “We reject the prejudicial and inflammatory comments made by Mr Justice Hayden. We also reject the portrayal by the court of appeal of our role in this case and the assistance that we have offered to Mr Evans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7029d2ccafe546cf29f66349114da2ef610c854/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=954233363b9b1bc9429800e0a13e9478","title":"dating after metoo should i ask my date if i can kiss her","story":"Dating is different in the post-#MeToo era, and Jean Hannah Edelstein is here to help you navigate it Been a nice date. Like to do it again.Does one kiss, or not kiss, to make a second time possible?The best way of guaranteeing a second date comes down not to whether or not you kiss someone, but whether or not you tell them that you’ve had a nice time and ask them to go on another date with you. But if you’re hesitating over whether or not you should kiss someone at the end of a date, just say: “May I kiss you?”Some months ago I had a conversation with a young man who believed this to be a passion-killer. He had heard rumors that women don’t like to be asked for permission to be kissed because it demonstrates some kind of weakness on the part of the person who asks. This is not true.If you ask someone permission for a kiss and they want to kiss you, they’re not going to reject you because you asked first, even if they didn’t think it was necessary for you to ask. Sure, there’s also a chance that they’ll say no, and that might be embarrassing. But if you kiss a person who doesn’t want to be kissed, that’s sexual assault. Not sexually assaulting the people we date should be collectively understood as more important than saving ourselves potential embarrassment. People who don’t understand this should stay home on their own.I am attracted to a woman at the department next door at work. I enjoy talking to her (and she seems to enjoy talking to me) but I don’t know how to flirt or ask her out without making her uncomfortable if she’s not romantically interested in me.So far I have complimented her (such as on her choice of clothes) and socialized with her in a group at lunch a few times, but I don’t know how to move forward.I am a man and a few years older than her, and she started at our company about six months ago while I have worked there for several years.The first question I have for anyone who is interested in dating a colleague is: do you value the possibility of romance with this person more than you value your job? It’s true that many people meet partners through work, but it’s also true that many people have to leave jobs – whether they choose to or get fired – because of an office romance that doesn’t work out. This might be a good time to review your company’s HR policy around dating within the office.If you do decide that this is worth pursuing: it’s great that you’re concerned about doing anything that’s unwelcome to the woman you’re interested in. Stick with that strategy. It means that you’re considering her feelings and you’re considering the risk of creating an environment at work that is uncomfortable for her. (On that note, I’d be careful about complimenting her choice of clothing: if you are not close friends it could be interpreted as crossing a professional line, especially if you do it frequently, even if with the kindest intention.)In a world of swipe-centered dating it sometimes seems that if something romantic doesn’t work immediately, then it’s never going to work. But in a scenario where your job could be at stake, it’s wise to take a slow, steady approach to friendship before you try to move towards something romantic. Maybe you could organize an outing after work or on the weekend with the group you lunch with in order to spend time with her and others in a more relaxed setting before asking for a drink on her own. It might also be worth asking one of those mutual friends, in confidence, for their opinion on whether she seems interested in you.If you don’t feel confident that you will be able to handle your future professional relationship if the woman you’re interested in turns you down, then do not ask her out, for the sake of her career and yours. There are plenty of other fish in seas that you don’t work in!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941daefdb07464da176d9b076e37d10b5895d563/392_380_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ddd757488c615e05ed65549a4675c7e","title":"six of the best one pot meals","story":"Cut down on the washing-up with these all-in-one dishes, including pork ribs with dumplings, chard gratin and Korean beef stew6 tbsp olive oil3 red onions, peeled and finely chopped5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped3 carrots, roughly chopped2 heads celery, outer branches removed, hearts roughly chopped1 bunch parsley leaves, roughly chopped5 tbsp tinned chopped tomatoes1 bunch cavolo nero, chopped500g cooked borlotti beans, cooking liquor reserved¾ loaf stale white bread or ciabatta, crust removed, cut into 2.5cm thick wedgesPlenty of good olive oil 600ml boiling waterSalt and black pepperIn a large heavy-based pot, fry the onions, garlic, carrots, celery and parsley uncovered in the olive oil for about one hour over a low heat.When these are entirely soft, add the tomatoes and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes.

Season the ribs with salt and pepper and brown them really well over a high heat in batches, so they colour nicely. Set aside with any juices. Don’t wipe the pan out.Add the potatoes to the pan and brown well all over. Add the onion, lower the heat and sweat for 10 minutes or until soft. Add the apple juice or wine, and deglaze the pan. Put the meat and juices back in the pan and add enough water to cover. Add the bay leaf, season, and cook over a low heat for two hours, or until the meat falls off the bones.Meanwhile, make the dumpling dough. Put the kefir or yoghurt, sunflower oil, vinegar, sugar and salt in a large bowl, and mix with a fork. Mix the flour with the bicarbonate of soda, then sift into the kefir mixture and mix in to a soft, pillowy dough. If it’s still slightly sticky, heavily flour your work surface and start kneading the dough, incorporating more flour into it. The dough should stop sticking to your hands when it’s ready but also remain soft. Divide the dough into four.Roll out each piece of dough on a floured surface into a 2mm rectangle. Add a tablespoon of the sunflower oil, rub all over with your hand, roll into thick sausages and cut each dough sausage into 5cm discs. You should end up with about 35 dumplings. Now check how much liquid there is in the stew. It should be still wet, but not too much. You want your dumpling bottoms to absorb some of the juices but their tops should steam.Turn up the heat under the stew. My gran used to call this ‘breathing strength’ into it. It should be boiling like crazy. Now swiftly but gently put the dumplings into the stew and cover, securing with a wet tea towel if steam escapes, so put a folded wet tea towel around the rim of the lid if you see steam escaping. Cook on high for 15 minutes, then lower and cook for another 30.

But how can you stop wasting your life in pointless meetings? Here’s an expert guideSome human inventions flash into being, get a little polish and then are pretty much left alone, their users generally satisfied, or at least not so dissatisfied that they attempt to come up with an alternative. No one tries to build a better hankie, a more comforting cuddle or a dinner plate “that really works”. Yet the search for the perfect business meeting seems never-ending. The caravan instead of the boardroom, the rubber chicken that bestows the right to speak: you name it, it has been tried and generally found to suck. Now Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has had a go, creating what he calls “the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter”.Weird? Maybe, though other words that spring to mind include “anal” and “stultifying”. As Bezos told the audience at the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, he has banned the PowerPoint presentations that dominate most commercial meetings. Instead, some poor devil must spend a week or more preparing “a six-page, narratively structured memo” full of “real sentences” rather than bullet points. Everyone else must then spend the first half-hour of the meeting silently – and publicly – pondering it, before moving on to a debate. Bezos calls this “a kind of study hall”.“Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely,” Bezos admits. “Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum …”If this sounds like your idea of hell, don’t panic. Some of the finest minds in business are working on alternatives.“This is quite pervasive in organisations now,” says Prof André Spicer from Cass Business School at City, University of London. “They might ask people to reflect for a few minutes in a meeting before making a decision. Or they’ll ask people to turn inwards, and think about what their own feelings are telling them.” Evidence suggests that injecting more mindfulness can help alleviate inidual anxiety, and help people focus better in meetings and lose the irrelevant information.“The danger of it, though,” says Spicer, “is that it gets treated as a way to cover up more systemic issues. For example, the Department of Health introduced a mindfulness programme to deal with health and wellness issues in the department. The truth was that the problems there were with endemic restructuring and extreme working hours – the mindfulness just extended meetings and the working day.”“The death of the long lunch is a tragedy for businesses,” says Spicer. “Many organisations had lunch together in cafeterias where everyone stopped and ate together and talked. There is research by Humanize, which studies social networks and work, that shows that people who go to lunch and sit in fairly large groups tend to do a lot better in the company, simply because they are building up networks and finding out what is going on in the business. Bring back lunch!”Actually, says Emma Sinclair, the co-founder of EnterpriseAlumni, there is a lot to be said for the regular company-wide catchup, even if it comes in the form of a traditional meeting. “People do need to feel included. And a bit of consistency is good.”“One PayPal executive, David Sacks, used to burst into meeting rooms like a prohibition-era cop and ask what people were meeting about,” says Bruce Daisley, the European vice-president at Twitter and the host of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast. “If it wasn’t any good, he would stop the meeting right then and there. I love this idea of superhero-style vigilantes closing meetings down. Imagine if the burden of having a meeting was that at any point you’d have to explain what the meeting was about. Brilliant! If all of us knew we would be held to account for the cost of a meeting and the amount of people’s time we are taking up, our perspective would be different. The meeting is taking all the fun out of our jobs because we are so scared of not being busy. But sitting at your desk and thinking is an important part of the job.”Ever sat in a meeting and wondered how much it was costing the company in terms of salaries? Tools such as Harvard Business Review’s business meeting cost calculator will put a figure on it. Spicer recommends a meeting budget. “If you want to invite a member of staff to your meeting, it will get taken off your budget. The cost of inviting loads of people to come along and listen to a PowerPoint presentation actually becomes valued, and you have to think: ‘Do we actually need this person there?’”Everyone wants meetings to be shorter, but stunts pulled in some workplaces such as making attendees hold the plank, do situps, speak against a timer or put money in a charity box if they overrun are counterproductive and, frankly, irritating. “I’m a bit suspicious of any of that jiggery-pokery,” says Stefan Stern, the co-author of Myths of Management. “That doesn’t feel like work to me. If you’re trying to achieve something from your meeting, you need to be focusing on the meat of the matter.” Rather than your aching muscles, for example.“All this show-and-tell stuff turns the meeting into a spectacle, rather than something productive,” agrees Spicer. However, he adds, standing meetings are effective at cutting meeting times. Walking and talking (favoured by Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama) has also been shown to help people work better. “Marily Oppezzo at Stanford University has done a lot of research in this area,” says Daisley. “She shows how meetings can engage ergent thought – so they help people come up with ideas, although not necessarily narrow them down.”“It’s a great idea to get people to check in their phones and laptops,” says Spicer. “Unless they are actually being used, not having them helps people focus their attention on what is actually going on in the room.” That doesn’t mean it’s not awkward, however. “I recently did some work with senior managers at a bank and they were forced to put their phones in sealed envelopes. They were constantly looking over to the cupboard where their phones were. As soon as the first break came, they ripped them open like they were crack addicts who had just seen a bag of crack. But once they had actually got focused on a task, they got a lot more done. One of the basic principles of productivity is that we are terrible at multitasking, so we need to remove as many distractions from meetings as possible.”Another Bezos rule: he won’t call a meeting, or even attend one, where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. “Meetings now are easier than ever to arrange,” says Daisley. This means they can often become “very low-quality exchanges of ideas and powerplay” if they are not considered properly and numbers kept under control. The solution is to “value the introverts”. “Most of modern work has been around celebrating the extrovert – brainstorming meetings, presentations, open-plan offices,” he says. “Performance art has become part of our job. But when you look into how a creative idea is formed, it is normally by inidual thinking and one-to-one conversation. As Susan Cain says in her book Quiet, the truth about the best collaborations is that they are in smaller groups – it’s more Lennon and McCartney than loads of people in an open-plan room.”“Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value,” the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, has said. “It is not rude to leave it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.” Of course, it is probably easier to get away with this when you are a fantastically rich company boss rather than an underpaid middle manager.“Is your meeting really necessary?” asks Stern. “As the management consultant Peter Drucker put it, ‘One either meets or one works.’” Daisley says we should abolish half of all meetings. “If you go into a meeting and somebody asks: ‘Has anyone got anything for today’s agenda?’, that should tell you that there is no point to it. We live in a world where the quality of our work is being appraised by others, by our bosses, so we never want to appear as if we’re not working hard. So when a meeting comes up that we are responsible for, we all want to show that we have packed agendas. We need to lose the fear of standing people down for meetings and cancel them.”How do you do it? Maybe cite some evidence. “We’re starting to realise that interruptions and distractions are the curse of getting anything done,” says Daisley. “We need to permit people to have quiet spaces. In Cal Newport’s book Deep Work, he argues that anything of any value is created only by a period of isolated concentration.” Something to send back on your next calendar invite."},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west on slavery for 400 years that sounds like a choice","story":"In a confrontation in the TMZ newsroom, the rapper talks about his view on slavery as well as reaffirming his support for Donald TrumpKanye West has said that 400 years of slavery is “a choice” in a TMZ interview that resulted in a confrontation.The rapper, who has been tweeting out support for Donald Trump in recent weeks, was talking about the president, free thinking and labels before he moved onto slavery.“When you hear about slavery for 400 years,” he said. “For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we’re the human race.”He then proceeded to talk directly to the entire office before TMZ reporter Van Lathan shot back at him for his comments. “I actually don’t think you’re thinking anything,” he said.He continued: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Lathan said he was “unbelievably hurt” about Kanye morphing into something that’s “not real”.West’s comments were met by anger and incredulity on social media.Earlier in the conversation, West reaffirmed his support for Trump calling him his “boy” and explaining why he tweeted a picture wearing a Make America Great Again cap. “I felt a freedom in doing something that everybody tells you not to do,” he said.West’s return to the spotlight has preceded the release of two new albums out in June. The rapper dropped two initial tracks over the past week to a mixed reception.Today also saw the release of an hour-long interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God which saw West say he’s in “a stronger place” than he’s ever been while also expressing hurt over Barack Obama calling him a “jackass”.“Don’t tell the world I’m a jackass,” he said. “I’m fightin’ hard enough. Something about me going on stage was similar to what you was doing. ’Cause I’m fighting to break the simulation, break the setup. That didn’t make no sense.”In the same interview, West also briefly touched upon slavery. “When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that’s when I wanted to use bitcoin,” he said. “It’s like all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don’t you put Michael Jordan on the $20 bill?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228680381c3818939c4023121b70a8ffa84c726d/0_104_6346_3808/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b96095e186c0a8b4916e3017b698af","title":"could grenfell cost the tories control of kensington and chelsea","story":"Labour is knocking on doors it never has before amid fierce criticism of the council’s response to the tragedyIn a church hall on a pretty Chelsea side-street lined with stuccoed Victorian houses, the local great and good gathered for a hustings before this week’s council elections.There were grumbles about local planning and the proposed Crossrail station on Kings Road but, surprisingly for a borough which has been so traumatised by the tragedy, the Grenfell fire barely got a mention.“It does make me wonder whether they’re more concerned about hanging baskets than they are about what happened there,” said one attendee. “It felt like a different world.”A few days later, at the other end of the borough and just a couple of hundred metres from the burnt-out shell of the tower, Jeremy Corbyn addressed dozens of placard-waving activists.“We’re going to put the government on notice,” the Labour leader announced to cheers. “And the council!” remarked one supporter.While psephologists and political analysts have been predicting results across the country, nobody is very keen to call Kensington and Chelsea.Even one of the most senior officials at the town hall is reluctant to be drawn. “I wouldn’t put money on it either way,” he said.On paper it looks like an almost insurmountable challenge for Labour, which holds just 11 seats to the Tories’ 37, all clustered in the poorer northern wards while the wealthier south remains true blue. Labour would have to take 15 more seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control.But many believe that the tide is turning. Labour’s Emma Dent Coad sent shockwaves through the local Tory establishment when she won Kensington at the 2017 general election, primarily on the back of Brexit in one of the most remain-supporting constituencies in the country.Then came the horrors of the Grenfell fire, which killed 71 people, and the woefully inadequate response from the town hall which saw even national Tory politicians heaping on the criticism.Jackie Michael, 57, who has lived in the north of the borough for more than a decade, said: “It is inconceivable that the Tories hang on to the council after the disastrous way they responded to the fire. All you need to do is look up, and you see the tower. It’s a constant symbol of their ineptitude.”But Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, is cautious. “In the last 12 months we’ve made astonishing progress in all areas of K\u0026ampC and while we may not take the council this time, we’re certainly going to come close to it,” he told the . “But there will be future elections and we will then be starting from a much stronger position.”Party insiders believe the most likely outcome is that it piles on votes in wards it already holds, while picking up a few extra seats in those which are currently split between the two main parties, although not enough to take control. “But we’re fighting seriously in wards where we haven’t fought for years,” said one Labour candidate.They also play down the relevance of Dent Coad’s victory. “It’s not quite as revolutionary as people think,” said one, suggesting the outspoken MP fears she may not win a second time so is keeping her options open by standing again for the council.Momentum has been out in force and, although Corbyn was campaigning in Ladbroke Grove, so far he has stayed away from the south of the borough. “I don’t think it would help if he was seen down the Kings Road,” said one party insider.Back in Chelsea, however, Labour is knocking on some doors it never has before. Activists report that some lifelong Tory voters think the council’s handling of Grenfell has been a disgrace, but concede that the most they can hope for is that they stay at home on Thursday.The local Conservative party was condemned for its insensitivity in November for sending out a questionnaire in one of the richest parts of the borough asking people to rate the importance of Grenfell as an issue alongside rubbish collections and parking.But some voters think that enough is enough. “The council has spent a fortune on big new homes for Grenfell victims. Why are they still complaining? It’s about time the self-flagellation stopped,” said one.Labour is attempting to stir up anti-Brexit sentiment among the thousands of European citizens who live in the borough – many of them in Chelsea - and who make up almost a fifth of the electorate.“Don’t overlook the fury of the Europeans,” said one candidate. “Usually these people don’t think local government matters. So we hope some can be prodded into casting a protest vote.”The biggest issues that come up on the doorstep in this part of the borough, however, are planning and parking. John Miller, 72, a retired accountant, said: “While we all recognise how terrible Grenfell was, I think any council would have struggled to deal with it. I am more likely to judge them on how they look after our public realm and our streets.”Whatever the result, the incoming council is going to look very different to the old one, with 17 Tory councillors not standing for re-election. Some have retired, others have stepped down over the fire and its aftermath.The Tory leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who took over after the fire, has been campaigning “all over the borough”, perhaps mindful of the damage done when she admitted she had never been inside a tower block before Grenfell.She is reluctant to comment on whether the tragedy – or the fact that some victims are still waiting for new permanent homes – will affect her electoral chances. “I can’t predict things. I can only just work as hard as I can, so we will see. Ask me afterwards,” she said in one interview.Daniel Moylan, a former deputy leader of the council who is standing down as councillor this time, is also hedging his bets. “It will be tough for the Conservatives. We could lose some seats but it will be difficult for Labour to take control of the council,” he said. “It would be a political tsunami if we lost. Though, of course, tsunamis do happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b299bd77de0a008f353cc581e3dbf88b5b309143/463_141_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8965b776d1a8e978f8201d6eee31e3a","title":"pm tries to hold cabinet together by delaying customs partnership decision","story":"Two options for EU arrangement set to remain on table as 11-strong subcommittee meetsTheresa May will attempt to head off a rebellion of her Brexit inner cabinet and prevent key leave-supporting ministers from resigning by delaying a final decision on her “customs partnership” model.The prime minister is expected to keep both of Downing Street’s options for a future customs arrangement with the European Union on the table at least for now as the 11-strong subcommittee meet for talks on Wednesday.No 10 sources said the prime minister had no plans to “boot out” one customs union option immediately and that officials would continue working on both.However, May faces a tense showdown with key Brexiters, after the  learned that they are planning to “pointedly and forcefully” persuade her to drop her preferred plan altogether.Downing Street has spent the last few days intensely lobbying ministers including David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson on the benefits of the so-called hybrid model, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.But the Brexiters now believe they have the numbers to force her hand, claiming that new home secretary Sajid Javid and defence secretary Gavin Williamson would back them, giving them a majority of six to five in the crunch talks.Under the so-called hybrid model – Theresa May\u0027s preferred plan – the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels. Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg have warned No 10 that such a partnership would be considered a red line. Other MPs regard it as the only way of successfully avoiding a\u0026nbsphard border in Northern Ireland. But EU officials regard this model as magical thinking.Brexiters hope to persuade the prime minister to keep the alternative on the table for now – the so-called maximum facilitation\u0026nbsp(“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology, exemptions for small businesses and goodwill to minimise border checks. They argue that unobtrusive checks a few miles from the Northern Irish border would not breach the government’s pledge to avoid a hard border. But again, EU officials have rejected this idea, arguing that waivers for small business add up to a smuggler\u0027s charter, while technological fixes alone will not be enough to solve the problem.It comes after it emerged that 60 Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have sent May a 30-page report setting out their opposition to the plan.The group is understood to have repeatedly warned No 10 in recent weeks that the customs partnership would be considered a red line, and crossing it could precipitate the collapse of the government. One remain-supporting cabinet minister told the  earlier that they expected the prime minister to make a “big push” for her preferred option at the meeting, but Whitehall officials suggested she would stop just short of ditching the alternative. Brexiter sources claimed that the prime minister had been told eight times by civil servants that her preferred option, which is backed by her top Brexit civil servant Olly Robbins, was unworkable but has continued to stick with it.The option is regarded as cumbersome and impractical by Brexiters, who describe it as the “unicorn” model and fear it would be “a customs union by the back door”.The customs partnership has become the most contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued, with many MPs regarding it as the only way of successfully avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.Brexiters hope to persuade the prime minister to keep the alternative on the table for now – the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.Conservative sources suggested Davis could be prepared to resign if the subcommittee throws its weight behind the prime minister’s option. Insiders said he felt “cut out of the loop” and concerned that he had been effectively replaced by Robbins, who is based in Downing Street.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, also put down a marker in a BBC interview, insisting that staying in the customs union in all but name would be unacceptable. He refused to deny that he might be prepared to resign if the government pressed ahead.“That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he said.“If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”One cabinet minister suggested that ultimately the government would have to settle for a customs union in all but name. “My more pragmatic colleagues understand that, faced with the need to fix this, we will have to reach an agreement that involves significant alignment with Brussels, although we will not technically be in a customs union.”Cabinet supporters of May’s preferred approach, including Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, believe it has a better chance of avoiding the risk of a hard border in Northern Ireland by allowing traders to move goods freely.“The technology is challenging for the hybrid option but if you solve it, it solves the Irish border question”, said a Whitehall source. “Max-fac is probably more technologically straightforward – but it requires borders.”However, the Brexiters are expected to push back against the idea that maintaining the integrity of the Good Friday agreement requires no infrastructure whatsoever between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Instead they will argue that unobtrusive checks set a few miles back from the border wouldn’t breach the government’s pledge to avoid a “hard border”.The departure of former home secretary Amber Rudd removes one of the strongest voices in support of staying in the customs union around the cabinet table. Brexiter sources have suggested that Javid, who reluctantly backed remain in the referendum, and Williamson, considered by colleagues to be pliable, would take a different position. The subcommittee could also be asked to consider extending membership of the customs union temporarily, while the successor arrangement is implemented. HMRC permanent secretary Jon Thompson told a select committee last September that the customs partnership could take up to five years to be introduced.On Brexit Williamson told an audience at the Institute of Economic Affairs on Tuesday night that it was “not the time to be timid or go into retreat”. He added: “As we look to Brexit, it is important that we see our Brexit choice not as a problem, but as an opportunity to expand our role in the world.”Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of political consultancy Eurasia Group, said with talks in Brussels at a standstill, negotiators would be watching the evolution of the government’s stance closely.“All eyes in Europe are on the Brexit subcommittee tomorrow, and what it throws up,” he said. But with the next round of talks in Brussels not due until late May, he suggested the prime minister could still delay narrowing her options too much.Rahman added that by continuing to press the hybrid option, which she knows is unacceptable to Brussels, May is engaged in “stagecraft”, while awaiting the outcome of a series of contentious parliamentary votes on the customs union. understands that neither the customs union, nor Brexit more generally, was brought up at Tuesday’s meeting of the full cabinet. They will be expected to endorse the final option once one is eventually agreed. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have been absolutely clear that we are leaving the customs union and won’t be joining a customs union. “We have put forward two proposals for addressing the customs issue in general and they will be discussed by the government further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228e784763864a8fda97137ffe3978f5b55f7e68/0_246_3727_2237/master/3727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=830e5d134469027998d12b5c0b410d62","title":"pro brexit mps urge pm to drop deeply unsatisfactory customs model","story":"Sixty Eurosceptic MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg urge Theresa May to ditch proposal but insist request is not an ultimatumTheresa May’s preferred customs model is flawed, “deeply unsatisfactory” and would keep the UK tied to the single market, the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said, urging the prime minister to ditch the proposal at a Brexit cabinet meeting on Wednesday.A group of 60 Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group (ERG), led by Rees-Mogg, have sent May a 30-page report opposing the prime minister’s plan for a “customs partnership” model, one of two options on the table at the Brexit cabinet subcommittee meeting.Rees-Mogg said the letter sent to May was not an ultimatum from Eurosceptic MPs, but he would not commit to backing the plan should it be put to parliament as part of the final Brexit agreement.Under the so-called hybrid model – Theresa May\u0027s preferred plan – the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.

Tory sources told the  the group had threatened to withdraw support for the government if the plan was pushed through.Rees-Mogg said the report should not be seen as a threat to May’s position. “I am neither John Wayne nor James Stewart. That is not the way we would behave towards the prime minister. There is no question of this being an ultimatum,” he said.Rees-Mogg said the plan would not deliver on the Conservative party manifesto or other commitments made by the prime minister. “This customs partnership is one of those clever ideas that sounded plausible when first looked at and when the detail is examined turns out to be deeply unsatisfactory, flawed and not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for.”Instead, Brexiters in the cabinet hope to persuade the prime minister to keep the other alternative on the table for now – the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology and a “trusted trader” scheme to minimise border checks.Crucial to the decision will be new home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, whose interventions are likely to tip the balance of the committee. Javid, a more natural Eurosceptic who said he voted remain “with a heavy heart”, replaced Amber Rudd on the committee, who had been at the heart of the cabinet caucus pushing for a softer exit, alongside the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark. Williamson told an audience at the Institute of Economic Affairs on Tuesday night that it was “not the time to be timid or go into retreat”.

The Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest.” May will ultimately be the deciding voice on the committee. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have been absolutely clear that we are leaving the customs union and won’t be joining a customs union. We have put forward two proposals for addressing the customs issue in general and they will be discussed by the government further.”Cabinet office minister David Lidington, May’s de-facto deputy, said both proposals had already been the subject of “intensive analytical work... looking at the practicalities, the operational challenges that would have to be surmounted, all these problems - the legal risks and so on”. May would engage with views from Tory MPs “from all strands of the debate about Europe,” he said.Though the debate may not be settled on Wednesday, Lidington said there was a time limit - June’s summit of EU leaders - where he said there needed to be “every effort to ensure there is significant progress in the negotiations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The reports come from NHS Digital (England only) and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.“Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example.“The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations.“Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.”He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP.“Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.”Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ceb21a267131486898a8cbe2ff1ae8fc75feef/0_241_5482_3290/master/5482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68359675c5e4069c5fb4d3ba21e7b684","title":"athletics world cup usain bolt mo farah","story":"• New July event in London hopes to give fans new stars• Adam Gemili: ‘We need new heroes and new people to get behind’For the past decade Usain Bolt has almost single-handedly carried casual fans’ interest in athletics on his 6ft 4in frame, with Mo Farah providing much of the auxiliary work in Britain. But when the track and field season kicks off in Doha on Friday two of its most bankable names will no longer be doing the heavy lifting.Bolt has retired. Farah has quit the track and many in the sport are unsure what the future holds. The lack of a world championships or Olympics this year only makes them more fearful that the sport may drift further from the mainstream.As Adam Gemili, a member of Britain’s gold-medal winning 4x100m relay team at the 2017 world championships, conceded: “We need new heroes and new people to get behind, especially in Britain. Bolt is Bolt and will we ever see another athlete like him? Probably not. And Mo has left a massive gap too.”Yet Gemili, one of the more eloquent athletes, is nevertheless optimistic. “There’s a lot of talented athletes in Britain,” he said. “Katarina Johnson-Thompson can smash it when in form. Andrew Pozzi has been under the radar because of injuries but now people are seeing his worth. And Holly Bradshaw and Laura Muir are hugely talented too. One of the problems is the sport is not on TV regularly enough to be in the public eye. But when it is on, people get behind it.”This year UK Athletics is pinning its hopes on a new two-day competition, the Athletics World Cup, in which eight leading nations – including Britain, the US and Jamaica – will compete for a $2m (£1.47m) prize fund under floodlights at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in London.Some think the event is a gamble, given it takes place on the same weekend as the World Cup final and the Wimbledon singles finals – and half the adult tickets will cost £100 or more (although the cheapest tickets are £38 and children’s tickets are £10).Richard Bowker, the new chair of UK Athletics, views it as an exciting opportunity. “Other sports have got World Cups that have been incredibly successful and this will be the same,” he said.“The format is a bit different, straight finals, one competitor from each country in each race, and with each point counting to a final tally.”Bowker is also confident the biggest names, including the world 60m champion Christian Coleman, will turn up and insists the World Cup will be the third pillar in a brilliant midsummer weekend of sport.“I rather like to think the guys at Fifa are sat there thinking: ‘Oh my goodness, we are the same day as the Athletics World Cup,’” he said, jokingly. “I think we will get World Cup fever, actually. I really do. The Fifa final and Wimbledon finals are in the afternoon, while we’re on at 7pm. They segue into each other. I think it will be an extraordinary weekend of sport.”Not everyone is as optimistic about the state of British athletics, given the lack of big sponsorship deals in recent years and the disappointing performance of some of the country’s athletes at last month’s Commonwealth Games.Bowker accepts the next generation will have to step up but is confident they can do so. “I spoke to Neil Black, our performance director, and he actually came back very positive from the Commonwealth Games,” he said.“There were some really good performances. Callum Hawkins is an absolutely phenomenal talent. Kyle Langford is great. Our sprinters are looking fantastic. And Johnson-Thompson got another gold medal.”He is just as optimistic about the sport’s future, despite Bolt’s retirement. “Athletics is cyclical. It moves on, it changes, it grows,” he said. “Usain was a one in a lifetime athlete and he did a huge amount for the sport. But this is a new era and there will be new stars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cee8e690138497fb804ef7ab9407fc948ceb266/0_148_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd9af6a32e881419f47d3b296c01a5e","title":"one green bottle review soho theatre london kathryn hunter hideki noda","story":"Soho theatre, LondonKathryn Hunter is the patriarch in Hideki Noda’s strange, yet ultimately moving, family tale that draws on Japanese traditionHideki Noda is a master of the theatrical endgame. In his 2012 show The Bee, a man’s family are taken hostage by an escaped convict so the man duly kidnaps the convict’s family. In this apocalyptic farce – the third of three Noda plays to be staged by Soho theatre, all starring the ever-playful Kathryn Hunter and all cast against gender – the family home becomes a prison of their own making. Hunter plays family patriarch Boo, the self-styled “legend of the classical stage” clinging to more than 600 years of Noh history. He is going out for the evening but wife Bo (Noda, who also directs) and daughter Pickle (Glyn Pritchard) also have appointments and are just as determined to leave the house. But with Princess the dog about to give birth, somebody has to stay home for the evening. Who is it going to be? Drawing on the Noh theatre tradition and featuring live musical accompaniment from Japanese kabuki musician Denzaemon Tanaka XIII, this is as strange and dislocating an evening as you can currently find in London. It’s like watching a heightened Ray Cooney farce crossed with Beckett and overlaid with a heavy veneer of Japanese cultural references. It is distinctly odd, and yet in the end oddly moving, too, as the entire family’s failure to take responsibility for the future has appalling consequences. The performances are spot-on, and if the outlandishness of the comedy sometimes veers dangerously close to being irritating, the piece earns its ending as it demonstrates the madness of standing your ground and refusing to give an inch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f29bb15b0927ffb0f74411763c9cff05fc921c0/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb526b8a6d6789af8adc72b663a51a8a","title":"apple second quarterly report best ever iphone x","story":"With revenues of over $61bn, Apple beat its 2015 record in the report released Tuesday – but sales of its most valuable product are slowingApple on Tuesday shook off worries that its $1,000 iPhone had failed to live up to the hype – but sales of the world’s most valuable company’s most valuable product are slowing, and Apple has announced a plan to buy its way out of trouble. “We’re thrilled to report our best March quarter ever, with strong revenue growth in iPhone, services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer. “We are very bullish on Apple’s future,” Cook told analysts after the news broke.Apple sold 9.11m iPads and 4.08m Macs over the quarter.Analysts had worried that the high-priced iPhone X would dent sales. The results came after Apple suppliers including AMS and Taiwan Semiconductors have reported slowing revenues in a sign seen by analysts as proof of shaky demand for iPhone X.The iPhone remains Apple’s biggest product, even as sales of services and other items, including the Apple Watch, have grown. Services – from the Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and others – generated $9bn over the quarter. But the 11-year-old mobile device accounts for the majority Apple’s revenues and contributed $100bn over the quarter. Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing.Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the results did not mean innovation in the high-end smartphone is dead.Husson said: “However, it indicates Apple will have to smartly manage its iPhone product portfolio and pricing, especially in Asia, where some countries still witness smartphone growth Apple has proven over the past few years that it masters the art and science of managing its product portfolio.”Yet Husson believes 2018 represents a tipping point for Apple. “It has no choice but to demonstrate it can reduce its dependency on iPhone sales and enter new adjacent markets and territories,” he said. “Because it’s a human-centered and ideas-driven marketing company, Apple is still the most valuable brand worldwide and it would be a mistake to make too early a call based on this quarterly financial earnings.”On a call with analysts Cook was once again critical of tech rivals, including Facebook, that have been rocked by privacy scandals. “We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5212b2278495aa9ccab09130436e3f2416f89ee7/152_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aba48378cea46f08cb725a22bf47e6f","title":"cobra kai review karate kid youtube reboot","story":"Starring the now middle-aged Billy Zabka and Ralph Macchio, YouTube Red’s reboot is sentimental but unrewardingLooking at the 56-year-old Ralph Macchio’s baby face, you’d be forgiven for thinking not much time had passed since he crane-kicked Johnny Lawrence in his face as martial arts wunderkind Daniel LaRusso. It’s been 34 years since the release of The Karate Kid and Macchio, reprising his role in the new YouTube Red original series Cobra Kai, has hardly aged. But you can’t say the same of the movie’s premise, which is more or less reconstructed piece-by-piece in the reboot, one of many new shows arriving on YouTube’s new streaming platform.For 1980s nostalgics, the experience of watching Cobra Kai will be like rummaging through the attic to find a relic you didn’t know you missed: besides the reappearance of Macchio as LaRusso and Billy Zabka as former-bully-now-lowlife Lawrence, there are copious flashbacks to the original film, references both subtle and overt to the sage-like Mr Miyagi, and a throbbing 80s soundtrack including Poison and the Human League. Like Glow and The Americans, two other shows that make use of that decade’s greatest hits, Cobra Kai hopes the music operates as a kind of sonic time machine. But unlike those shows, Cobra Kai takes place in 2018, in a world where particularly woke teenagers take umbrage at being called a “pussy”. The result, then, is a reasonably charming, often corny and ultimately anachronistic show, presumably willed into unnecessary existence by the recent spate of 80s reboots, from Roseanne to Dynasty to Cagney \u0026amp Lacey.Lawrence, the boorish antagonist of the original film, got what he deserved: he’s now an angry, hapless middle-aged man living in a ramshackle Reseda apartment. In the opening minutes of the pilot, written by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg and Josh Heald, he loses his job in construction after insulting a client and has his Pontiac nearly wrecked by a group of teens. Things lock into place, though, when he sees his immigrant neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña) getting bullied outside the local corner store, leading him to beat the absolute crap out of the bullies and take Miguel under his wing. From here on out, Johnny will be known as Sensei, and Miguel as his pupil. On the wall of his dojo, the karate studio he opens without a license, famous lines from The Karate Kid paint the wall: “Strike First. Strike Hard. No Mercy.”Over in Encino, LaRusso lives in far fancier dwellings. He’s now a wealthy luxury car salesman with a happy family. His face, seen frequently in hokey local TV ads where he karate-chops the prices of automobiles in half, haunts his old nemesis Lawrence. A series of plot points contrive to bring the two together, like the nearly totaled car, which finds Lawrence at LaRusso’s shop, and the fact that Miguel attends school with LaRusso’s popular teenage daughter, Samantha (Mary Mouser), ostensibly building to a rematch of that All Valley Karate Tournament, fought this time, perhaps, with teenage proxies.There’s a meta-sentimentality to Cobra Kai – an awareness of its appeal and what it’s trying to do – that has eluded this year’s other 80s reboots, particularly Roseanne. Where that show seems to have forgotten why it was so popular in the first place, Cobra Kai is keenly aware that nostalgia is its biggest draw. But not all of it works. In one scene, Lawrence tells Miguel, who can barely throw a punch: “You don’t want to be a pussy, you want to have balls!” “Don’t you think you’re doing a lot of genderizing?” Miguel replies, adding something about how words perpetuate “sexist” world views before trailing off. That the character of Miguel – a lanky and timid boy who nurses his asthma on the karate mat – would never say that to his “sensei” is apparently no matter the show would rather inject its source material with belabored contemporariness than attempt to genuinely update its premise.YouTube, though, is expecting big things from Cobra Kai, the most high-profile show yet to debut on its new paid subscription service. With 10 half-hour episodes, the show is compact if not bingeable, and its conceit alone should bring eyeballs. But despite its sentimental appeal and a mostly impressive cast, the sheer volume of shows available now makes it hard to see Cobra Kai getting its feet off the mat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377460c9c9dc493cee3699e358e0020069a51c46/0_406_4041_2426/master/4041.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bed75c39e6c19580f648133a53a31fa","title":"how i deciphered silent witness using football and a spreadsheet","story":"When the ’s football tactics wizard wanted a way to unwind between assignments, the BBC’s pathology drama seemed like the perfect foil. Then he noticed some giant plot holes and former Southampton striker Neil ShipperleyLast year, I watched my first episode of Silent Witness – largely because I’d run out of Poirots, Marples, Veras, Rebuses, Morses and Endeavours. It had always been there, vaguely in the background for the previous 21 years, but it was never something that had much concerned me. But it was good, just preposterous enough – ideal for a football journalist looking for something to watch over lunch while working from home or to wind down in another featureless hotel room after a game.I watched season 20 first, then 19, and then went back to the start when, rather than the ensemble based around Dr Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox), the main character was Dr Sam Ryan (Amanda Burton). I preferred the broader scope of the more recent episodes (each story was initially screened on BBC in two parts, each lasting an hour I have used the term “episode” to refer to a two-hour long story as it was subsequently broadcast on channels such as UKTV’s Drama Channel). My preference for the later episodes meant I jumped to season eight, when Burton leaves and Fox comes in. But then I felt bad about neglecting the early ones so began alternating between seasons two and nine, then three and 10, and so on, while also watching season 21 when it was screened earlier this year.Keeping track of which episodes I’d seen became difficult, so I drew up a chart to help. This has been brutally satirised on the ’s Football Weekly podcast, which has suggested I have some sort of exhaustive spreadsheet, all arrows and photos like the evidence boards used (at least by TV police) in murder investigations. I don’t, but immersion in a series means you do start to notice patterns: recurring plots, recurring actors and – far more significant – a recurring piece of football commentary.Now, if I’m aware of that, with just a notepad and a memory that essentially is no longer good for anything other than reeling off sports statistics from the 1980s, you can only assume that the writers and producers know exactly what they are doing. So when Neil Stuke (AKA The Stuke) appears playing Ch Insp Cooke in series 21, you realise that the most logical explanation is that Andy Fox, the rogue undercover cop he played in series three, must actually have survived despite appearing to commit suicide while in police custody. Perhaps that’s not a surprise – it probably suited everybody for him to be believed dead so he could start afresh – but it means Dr Ryan must have faked the postmortem. Shockingly, she had form.At the end of series one, DC Kerry Cox, played by Ruth Gemmell, is ‘killed’ after a blow to the head from a metal beam. Again, Dr Ryan stages the postmortem, and yet Cox reappears in series 10 under the name Beth Ashdown, having lost her north-east accent and been promoted to DI. (It may be that in the Silent Witness universe surnames ending “-ox” are a code for undercover officers). By series 17, the Gemmell figure has left the force, married a policeman and taken the name Ellie Brooke. The pressure of her multiple identities seems to have got to her and, after two suicide attempts, she kills a pregnant woman. None of that, though, is as confusing as the mystery of Neil Shipperley’s disallowed goal for Southampton against Manchester United, which hangs over the second season. The incident is first seen on television as a neighbour goes to visit a grieving neighbour one evening. It’s easily identified as having happened during United’s 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final on Monday 11 March 1996. So far, so plausible. Except there is something odd. The game was on Sky, whose commentators were Martin Tyler and Andy Gray, but the voice we hear over the footage of Shipperley is that of David Pleat. The former Tottenham manager’s words weren’t broadcast until the highlights on Match of the Day, screened on BBC One at 10.10pm that evening. Yet it’s implied – and the light suggests – the game is being watched live. Perhaps the streetlighting is very bright, or perhaps this is a hint that this moment illuminates the entire show.In the very next episode, as a suspect sits in front of a television, we hear Pleat’s incredulity at the referee’s decision once again. In itself, that’s not problematic. Why wouldn’t two people in Cambridge both be watching the same match? And why wouldn’t the writers separate out two unrelated cases to make the plotting simpler? Except that Dr Ryan’s relationship with Supt Ross, going well at the time of Pleat one, has all but collapsed by the time of Pleat two.Perhaps the suspect has simply recorded Match of the Day and is watching a video some time later. But another, more intriguing, possibility occurs. What if these two cases were concurrent? What if Dr Ryan, a pathologist we know to have faked at least two postmortems, provoking who knows what feelings of guilt and anxiety, is prone to mood swings? That might explain why, across 27 episodes over eight seasons, she is so incapable of maintaining a stable relationship with anybody, from her mother and sister to lovers or colleagues.The whole programme, perhaps, is rather more subtle than is generally realised. After all, can it really be coincidence that the FA Cup tie that turns out to be the key to the whole series was played just three days before Silent Witness aired for the very first time?

Between 1973 and 1978, at least 100 people are believed to have been murdered at the site and their bodies destroyed.Now a new hunt is under way to find a grave believed to contain the remains of some of those who were “disappeared” at Colonia Dignidad. Relatives still fighting for answers hope that fresh excavations may reveal forensic science evidence – and grant them a degree of closure.“Finding this grave is the last hope for the families of the disappeared. The search must continue for as long as it takes to find it,” said Winfried Hempel, a lawyer representing the victims of human rights abuses perpetrated at the enclave.Colonia Dignidad was founded in 1961 by Paul Schäfer, a former medic in the Nazi-era German army who fled Germany in 1959 after being charged with child abuse.Surrounded by watchtowers and electrified fences and patrolled by armed men and guard dogs, the community was populated by about 300 Germans, and cut off from the rest of Chile.Schäfer – who died in a prison hospital in 2010 – was accused of running a cult-like community where he systematically abused young children. According to prosecutors, he also allowed Pinochet’s agents to torture political prisoners in a maze of stone-walled tunnels beneath the enclave.In 1978, the Dina chief, Manuel Contreras – hoping to destroy evidence of human rights abuses – ordered the exhumation and disposal of all the executed prisoners’ remains.According to Chile’s national commission for truth and reconciliation, 40 corpses may have been dug up at Colonia Dignidad, before being chemically burned and their ashes tossed into the river Perquilauquén, which runs to the south of the 37,000-acre compound.But recently, a former member of the colony – who at the time was in charge of the heavy machinery used to exhume the bodies – testified that one grave had been left intact.The victims of Colonia Dignidad were not all Chileans: in 1985, Boris Weisfeiler, a nationalised US citizen born in the Soviet Union, vanished while trekking a few miles from the enclave. According to witnesses, local police detained and beat him before taking him to the colony where he disappeared.“After 33 years of agonising search to find my brother, I still hold hope that they find his remains,” said Boris’s sister, Olga Weisfeiler, who lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Eight retired police and military officers were eventually indicted over Weisfeiler’s abduction in 2012, but four years later, a judge applied the statute of limitations and closed the case.“I have given up on getting answers from the Chilean government as to what happened to him,” she said. “At present, it seems both the Chilean government and its judicial system are complicit in stalling the judicial process and in avoiding taking responsibility for my brother’s tragic death.”In October, the search for the truth of Villa Baviera gained new impetus when Judge Mario Carroza ordered a new search of the site, but the recent election of billionaire businessman Sebastián Piñera as president has raised fears that there is little political appetite for a full reckoning.After more than a decade on the run, Schäfer was arrested in 2005 and sentenced to 20 years in jail for sexually abusing and torturing children at the colony.Today, Villa Baviera is run by Anna Schnellenkamp, daughter of one of Paul Schäfer’s right-hand men, Kurt Schnellenkamp, who died in 2017 after serving a five-year prison sentence for enabling Schäfer’s abuse.The colony survives on income from a poultry farm, which produces 30,000 eggs a day, and tourism: there is a manmade-lake with pedal boats, a restaurant serving venison, sauerkraut and other German dishes, and a small museum that makes no mention of the disappeared.Relatives of the disappeared say that the site of mass murder should not be a leisure centre they have called for Villa Baviera to be closed and replaced with a memorial. “It is not possible that a place where serious violations of human rights such as torture, murders and disappearances should function as a tourist destination,” said Margarita Romero, president of the Association of Memory and Human Rights.“Imagine a hotel built in a concentration camp in Europe – it would never be permitted.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef5651f6461dae923ce0985b7e8df2876cda35d/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb84c1ac283ba718b1cb5c000c0eaad2","title":"jacinda ardern asks why new zealand is left off world maps in new tourism campaign","story":"Video shows the prime minister and NZ comedian Rhys Darby questioning why the nation has been omitted from so many maps New Zealand is aiming to crack the mystery of why it is often left off world maps, as part of a new tourism campaign featuring prime minister Jacinda Ardern.The #getnzonthemap campaign features Ardern and Flight of the Conchords comedian Rhys Darby in a two-minute video exploring why the nation is continually left off maps of the globe.“We’re a bit of a fiddly looking shaped country, a bit like a half-eaten lamb chop.

The charismatic 26-year-old, rarely seen without his “Pashteen hat”, leads the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), which has convulsed the country with unprecedentedly virulent criticism of the powerful armed forces. It accuses the military of being behind a litany of abuses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), an inhospitable, mountainous region on the border with Afghanistan dominated by Pakistan’s 15-million-strong Pashtun minority and which has played host to a variety of terrorist groups.Although Pashteen is committed to non-violent protest, his youthfulness, firebrand speeches and distinctive headgear have drawn comparisons with Che Guevara.What marks the PTM out as a particular threat to Pakistan’s army, which has ruled the country for more than half its 70-year history, is that its allegations mirror those made by western officials, namely that the army plays a “double game” with regard to terrorism, silently supporting groups that target India and Afghanistan.The government has responded with a crackdown, banning rallies and harassing PTM supporters. Nine PTM activists have gone missing in Karachi, Pakistan’s southern business capital. At a rally last weekend in Swat, pro-military protesters tried to block entry to some of a 25,000-strong crowd.Even the “Pashteen hat” has been subjected to local, unofficial bans. Replicas can no longer be found in the Swat valley city of Mingora, where at least five shopkeepers selling the hat were recently detained and beaten by thugs associated with the military, locals say.At a rally in Lahore on 21 April, held in defiance of the government ban, Pashteen bowed his head like a boxer as minders escorted him through an exultant, selfie-taking crowd to a stage adorned with pictures of missing people. Earlier that day, sewage had mysteriously flooded the ground. About 8,000 people – many in the Pashteen cap – chanted “the uniforms are behind the terrorists”, a slogan that fosters particular apoplexy in the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.Pashteen tells his audience that he has come to Lahore, a city populated by relatively few Pashtuns, to “expose what the army are doing against us”. To his right, a gigantic poster shows a devastated, rubble-strewn street in a town in North Waziristan partly flattened during a 2014 military campaign against Pakistan’s Taliban. That campaign is credited with helping reduce deaths from terrorism by more than two-thirds. Yet, according to the PTM, ordinary Pashtuns were caught in the crossfire, and have ever since been subject to humiliating curfews, checkpoints and collective punishment by troops stationed to maintain order.So-called enforced disappearances generate particular grief. A government commission has dealt with almost 5,000 cases since 2011, but rights groups say this number vastly underestimates the scale of the problem. “According to the constitution, anybody who commits a crime must be produced in a court of law within 24 hours,” says Pashteen. “But so many people have been taken and are still missing.” His voice rising, almost to a scream, Pashteen yells at the crowd “are you with the tyrants?” He calls on ordinary soldiers to defy the orders of high command, a statement some have interpreted as treasonous. One rally-goer from Pakistan’s Punjab majority bites his lip and glances anxiously over his shoulder. “It’s quite remarkable hearing this,” he says, on condition of anonymity. “What it portends for Pakistan I don’t know.”By tradition the military is largely referred to in code, as “the establishment” or, in the case of agents of the feared Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), “angels”. Among PTM-supporters, however, that is changing. “Before the PTM we didn’t say anything, even in our bedrooms, about the ISI and military intelligence,” says Shehrullah Khan, whose brother was “disappeared” from his luggage shop in 2016. With some safety in numbers, “we can now say everything in our mind and hearts”. PTM leaders admit that some of the disappeared may have links to the Taliban, but argue that all should be produced in court to face charges.A white flag, representing the movement’s commitment to non-violent protest, flutters above the stage. Among the stereotypes Pashteen is helping to break down, says analyst Fasi Zaka, is that of “Pashtuns being a martial ethnic group given to conflict”. Its leaders argue that Pashtuns are more victims of the Taliban than the willing hosts often portrayed in the media. One, Ali Wazir, has had 17 members of his family or killed.The military response betrays choking discomfort. General Bajwa, the chief of army staff, has referred indirectly to the PTM as being “engineered” by Pakistan’s enemies. Reporting on the movement has been censored in the media. Yet, unable to stop its growth, corps commander Lt General Nazir Ahmad Butt held a meeting last week with the PTM to discuss its “legitimate grievances”, referring to a five-point list of demands that includes de-mining, the punishment of a Karachi police chief accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, and a “truth and reconciliation commission” on enforced disappearances.“The PTM’s success,” says civil rights activist Jibran Nasir, is that after years of denial, some in the military “admit there have been some transgressions”.From the back seat of a car whisking him away from a horde of supporters, Pashteen tells the  that he is unconcerned by a possible threat to his life. “At first my family said they would throw me out of the house,” he says, “but now they say if you are killed, then at least you will have done something for the people.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480746.1525206423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse chief in line for large fees and share options from us firm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O Brien, HSE director general: will receive fees totalling $65,000 (€54,000) a year from his work for San Diego-based Evofem Biosciences, a female contraceptive manufacturer.

The company referred to Mr O’Brien’s role leading the Irish national health service in a March 21st public statement to the stock market released in advance of its annual meeting next week.As a non-executive director of the company Mr O’Brien will receive an “annual cash retainer” of $50,000 in addition to $10,000 a year from his role as chairman of the company’s compensation committee and $5,000 a year as a member of the company’s audit committee.The HSE chief currently holds no shares in the company.The company’s filing last month says, however, that he has the chance to buy into the company he will be awarded options for 24,691 shares, which would be worth $181,725 based on Evofem’s share price last night on Wall Street’s Nasdaq technology-dominated stock exchange. The California firm lists Mr O’Brien’s past roles as founding chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service and director of CervicalCheck in an extensive biography in stock market statements, along with his past role as chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association.

They might get emotional and start kicking up. They might even decide to sue.Women of Ireland: What you don’t know won’t hurt us . . .Another day in the Dáil and another gallop of TDs into the chamber to agonise over the latest sorry episode concerning this State’s disordered relationship with women from the waist down. More than once, TDs listed the many dangerous indignities visited on Irish women through the decades by a paternalistic establishment.The Taoiseach led the way in the afternoon as the cervical cancer screening scandal became the main topic of discussion, running well into the evening with the Minister for Health listening to statements and taking questions for more than three hours.“I know this whole controversy is having a huge impact on the women of Ireland. It is about women’s health it’s about women’s lives,” said Leo Varadkar, as women wondered if there will ever come a day when the intimate details of their health and their lives are not dissected and debated and held up for public scrutiny by very important men.“This comes after a very difficult year with controversies around issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassments and difficult rape trials and other matters as well. And I know this country hasn’t always treated women very well, and in the past and even today perhaps, treats them very badly, whether it is mother and baby homes or Magdalen laundries or the marriage bar or the Hep C scandal.”As the contributions from TDs piled up, Leo’s initial list was expanded by other speakers.Of course, the catalogue of insults they reopened was an old one. These things don’t happen in these more enlightened times.Except they do.“Even tonight you’ve been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information, drip-feed, reclarifying the information,” said Daly. She accepted the cancer screening process is not wholly reliable. Mistakes happen no matter what systems are in place and tragedies happen and will continue to happen. How society responds is what matters.It was agreed by all sides the response by CervicalCheck and ultimately the HSE to the women whose cancer was not detected in their initial tests has been completely unacceptable.The situation is a mess. Women who have had cervical smears and were given the all-clear are now worrying their results may not have been correct. The Taoiseach made a point of stressing “there is nobody walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE.”He was personally “very angry” that women were not told that following an audit of their tests it was discovered that pre-cancerous cells were not picked up when they had their first check. “I’m a Taoiseach, a doctor and also a brother with two sisters.”He mentioned his anger twice. “Not just angry, Taoiseach, you should be livid, livid about what’s after happening in these cases,” responded Joan Collins of Independents4Change.Meanwhile, Alan Kelly couldn’t believe his ears when Minister for Health Simon Harris imparted his new information. It was “a bombshell that you’re after landing in her tonight, which I wasn’t prepared for . . . This is a bombshell. What volume of women haven’t had their cases audited?”And he looked around the chamber, with its usual overpopulation of men in suits.“We actually have a big problem in this country protecting women’s health” he declared, adding that Vicky Phelan, the woman with terminal cancer whose diagnosis was missed and who had to take her fight to the High Court, was probably following the debate at home.“I’m sure she’s watching us all here tonight, fellas,” he said.Louise O’Reilly, Sinn Fein’s health spokeswoman, echoed remarks made during Leaders’ Questions by Mary Lou McDonald about the decision not to tell women that their first test for cancer should have come up as positive.“The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and Government against women who have been wronged by the State is now in full public view” she said, urging the Minister to ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Phelan and others have been made to do.The Fianna Fáil leader summed up the state of confusion surrounding the story. “Everybody knew but nobody knew, and nobody could tell us anything in the past week. It had to be dragged and drip fed in a frenzied way.”Mary Lou McDonald homed in on the presumption of medics who decide what a woman with terminal cancer needs to know.“They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly their outcomes could have been different. They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and to others.” It was part of a “a toxic culture of concealment and a refusal to take responsibility within the HSE, a culture in which women are literally allowed to die before fault is admitted.”All day, the questions kept coming for the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health, underlining the sense of confusion and ignorance felt by people trying to fathom the detail of this scandal.It’s creating a sense of worry where there should be none.“Across Ireland today, there are many thousands of women terrified following the revelations about the CervicalCheck screening programme,” said Labour leader, Brendan Howlin. What’s to be done to reassure them?Mary Lou called for the resignation of the head of the HSE, Tony O’Brien.But the Taoiseach said the full facts have yet to emerge, but he is determined to get to the bottom of the issue. He asked for more time. “I think everyone, even Tony O’Brien, deserves a fair hearing.”Whatever we do, it should be based on facts. We are letting women down, and letting people’s health down, in particular, women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts.We are really letting people down, particularly the women of Ireland, with regard to women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on fact.Facts are already out there: the Taoiseach outlined some of them, others were added, such as symphysiotomy, maternal deaths, Brigid McCole, Susie Long . . .And in the chamber, there was the unspoken spectre of the referendum and the further fears of pregnant women who have cancer and how the State might treat them too.The wonderful women of Ireland, so beloved of all TDs in the Dáil.What they don’t know won’t hurt them.What you don’t know won’t hurt us.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481326.1525255038!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rt%C3%A9 s use of irish as infrequent as most of its commercial rivals report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRTÉ’s policy position is to increase the amount of Irish heard on radio, with more Irish language and bilingual programming on Radio 1, 2fm and Lyric Fm. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe Two senior academics who conducted in-depth research into the use of Irish on radio stations have found that RTÉ’s service is as infrequent as most of its commercial rivals. Dr John Walsh of NUI Galway and Dr Rosemary Day of Mary Immaculate College in Limerick reviewed 59 radio stations throughout the State to ascertain the extent and depth of their Irish language coverage. In a presentation to the Oireachtas Committee on the Gaeltacht and Irish on Tuesday, they said the average broadcasting time for Irish language material across the stations was about 3.5 hours per week per station, often at non-peak hours, and often using material that was either bought-in, recycled, or repeats. They found that the time allotted to Irish-language coverage on RTÉ Radio 1, Lyric FM and 2FM was low. The national broadcaster erted most of its its Irish-language content to Raidió na Gaeltachta, which is primarily aimed at the Gaeltacht regions and not at the State as a whole. There is an argument that a national broadcaster should be “mainstreaming” its Irish language content, particularly for audiences in Dublin and other non-Gaeltacht communities where Irish is spoken regularly. The station’s own policy position is to increase the amount of Irish heard on radio, with more Irish language and bilingual programming on Radio 1, 2fm and Lyric Fm.But the authors found: “Apart from news bulletins in Irish, the remainder of Irish language output on RTÉ Radio One is repackaged from RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta.”One criticism made by both academics is that the 2009 legislation was weak and unclear and imposed very loose obligations on broadcasters. Some included only inserts of Irish-language into their programming. Dr Day said both believed the Section 66 of Broadcasting Act 2009, which included reference to Irish, had failed in its purpose. “It is too weak and unclear,” she told the committee. “There are aspirations rather than obligations and it is clear that there is no priority given to Irish.”For example, for stations located where there are Gaeltacht areas, the Act states, “(they) shall have particular regard to the continuance and advancement as a spoken language of the Irish language.”Their research found that, until last year at least, most local radio stations located in those areas had little or no Irish content.The research revealed that four stations broadcast no Irish at all in their schedules last year. Among them was Today FM which broadcasts across the State. The others were Galway Bay FM, KCLR FM and the community station Ros Fm. Since the publication of the report, Dr Day and Dr Walsh told the committee that all four stations had been in contact with them in the interim and were addressing the Irish content deficit. Galway Bay FM has now started a half-hour programme in Irish at weekends. Stations aimed at younger people like iRadio, Spin, and Flirt FM in Galway were the best performers among the stations surveyed. Another finding of the research was that Irish was considered as a lightweight topic, associated with ‘craic’ or traditional music. There was no current affairs programme in Irish and, besides RTÉ, limited or no use of news bulletins in Irish. “This would suggest that Irish is not usually seen by stations as a vernacular language but either as a hobby for those who remember some Irish from school or a sop to vague licensing requirements,” the report states.“Ba bhreá linn raidió náisiúnta do dhaoine óga mar atá ag Baile Atha Cliath le Raidió na Life,” a dúirt Dr Walsh leis an gcoiste.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480684.1525202031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis says eu and uk may be unable to resolve border issue before october deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis  giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee  on  UK withdrawal from the EU. Photograph:  PA WireBritain and the European Union may be unable to resolve the future of the Border before they agree a deal on their future relationship in October, Brexit secretary David Davis has said. Mr Davis told the House of Lords EU committee that the viability of the first of three options for the Border outlined in last December’s joint report depended on whether Britain and the EU would have a comprehensive free trade agreement.“If we have a tariff-free free trade agreement and a light-touch customs agreement that makes Northern Ireland simpler than if we don’t have those things. So it’s all three we want, because truth be told I would consider it not a success if we were falling back on option C,” he said, referring to the so-called “backstop” that would see Northern Ireland remain in regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.“I can see why the Irish Government wants it as a guarantee, but we have to have all three. Now ,whether we can do all that by June, I’m not at all sure. But we are certainly aiming to complete it by October.”Mr Davis admitted that the EU had “pushed back” on the British government’s two proposals for a future customs relationship, confirming a report in the Daily  last month. He said EU negotiators did not understand how a “customs partnership” would work, with Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and feared that the other proposal could encourage smuggling.Mr Davis will join other senior ministers on Wednesday for a meeting of the cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee that will focus on options for a customs relationship. Brexiteers want Theresa May to take the “customs partnership” off the table because they fear it is unworkable and could lead to Britain remaining indefinitely in the customs union.International trade secretary Liam Fox said on Tuesday that remaining in the customs union after Brexit would be worse than remaining in the EU itself.“If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice. That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he told the BBC. Downing Street said the government would offer a “robust” response to a House of Lords vote to\u0026nbspgive MPs the power to stop Britain from leaving the EU without a deal, and to order the prime minister back to the negotiating table if they do not like the deal she secures.The Daily Mail on Tuesday described the Lords as a “house of unelected wreckers”, accusing pro-European peers of acting “in cahoots with Brussels” as they sought to derail Brexit.In the House of Commons on Tuesday, a Conservative MP accused the founder of the pro-Brexit Legatum Institute of being a Russian agent. Bob Seely used parliamentary privilege to quote from Monaco security files that identified Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire, as an object of interest.“According to the French security services as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco, and clearly I am confident that these documents are genuine, Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for the Russian intelligence services’,” Mr Seely said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481274.1525251306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kanye west defends himself after slavery as a choice comment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘When you hear about slavery for 400 years . . . for 400 years? That sounds like a choice.’ Photograph: Jonathan BradyPAKanye West has defended himself after suggesting that 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice”, saying: “We can’t be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years.”The rapper also likened himself to 19th century African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman in a series of tweets, and said he was being attacked “for presenting new ideas”.West attracted criticism after saying during an interview with TMZ Live: “When you hear about slavery for 400 years . . . for 400 years? That sounds like a choice.“Like, you was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all? It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It’s like slavery, Holocaust. Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks.“So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. We’re the human race.”Following the interview, West took to Twitter and said: “We need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain.”He added: “To make myself clear — of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will.“My point is, for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved.“They cut out our tongues so we couldn’t communicate to each other. I will not allow my tongue to be cut.”The Gold Digger star said that “if this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Nat”, referring to Tubman and also Nat Turner, an American slave who led a rebellion to free slaves in the 19th century.West continued: “The reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can’t be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years.“We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought. It was just an idea.”Will.i.am criticised West’s “harmful” and “ignorant” comment that 400 years of slavery in America “sounds like a choice”. The Voice UK star told ITV’s Good Morning Britain following West’s controversial remarks: “That statement was one of the most ignorant statements that anybody that came from the ‘hood could ever say about their ancestors, that slavery is a choice. What are you talking about?” He added: “That’s not Kanye. “To me that’s a different person that’s saying that. And I hope it’s not to raise awareness so he could sell a record and some shoes, because that would be the worst thing to do. “To stir up a very touchy race situation and you be the benefactor from it.” Will.i.am said: “So I encourage you, if you really believe this, give your shoes away for free, give your album away for free — I don’t like talking about going against my community, but that is harmful.” West’s comments during the interview sparked an immediate response from TMZ writer Van Lathan, who was seen confronting the music star in a snippet posted online.West, who recently returned to Twitter after an absence and declared his support for US President Donald Trump, was shouting across the office: “Do you feel that I’m feeling . . . do you feel that I’m being free and I’m thinking free?”Lathan stood up and told him: “I think what you’re doing right now is actually the absence of thought.“Kanye, you’re entitled to your opinion ... You’re entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real world, real life consequence behind everything you just said.“And while you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.“We have to deal with the marginalisation that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice.Lathan said he was “disappointed”, adding: “I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that is not real.”Among those criticising West were his friend, musician John Legend, who retweeted a post that read: “Kanye’s rhetoric continues to fuel the racist right-wing folks who believe that black people are responsible for their oppression.”–PA "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/04/04/TELEMMGLPICT000005939780_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCHco2f1jjYcmYrb_Lt46UmwWzvACcNUMcUiT4K693G0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"day 1982 argentine ship belgrano sunk hms conqueror claiming","story":"The ARA General Belgrano was sunk by HMS Conqueror in the South AtlanticUSS Phoenix was one of the few ships to survive the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.

Your friends aren’t going to see your profile, and you’re only going to be suggested to people who are not your friends.”The announcement drew a tongue-in-cheek welcome to the competitive online dating field from IAC, whose holdings include platforms like OKCupid and Tinder.“Come on in. The water’s warm. Their product could be great for US-Russia relationships”, CEO Joey Levin said in a statement, referencing the fact that Russian-linked operatives have been accused of using Facebook to widen societal ides and influence the 2016 presidential election.Chief Facebook product officer Chris Cox explained the details of the new dating feature further, saying that it has been in development for a long time.“We were convinced dating would be the next feature Facebook would add,” Mr Cox said, referring to when he first joined Facebook in 2005. “We hope this will allow more folks to meet, and hopefully find partners.”The feature will be opt-in and will be supported through the Facebook app.“People already use Facebook to meet new people, and we want to make that experience better,” Facebook explained. ”People will be able to create a dating profile that is separate from their Facebook profile – and potential matches will be recommended based on dating preferences, things in common, and mutual friends.“They’ll have the option to discover others with similar interests through their Groups or Events. However, what people do within the dating feature will not be shown to their friends. We’ll share more information when this begins testing later this year.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

But Mr Zuckerberg gave no indication of any fallout and thanked Mr Koum for working with him, referring to him as a tireless advocate for privacy and encryption.Mr Zuckerberg did also reference the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but only in passing. He offered no apology for its part in the data abuse scandal, referring only to an intense week.Facebook unveils online dating feature to rival TinderHe did reiterate a series of commitments apparently intended to quell public anger about the dangers of Facebook. They included a commitment to securing data and new investments to ensure that the site didn\u0027t damage security or elections.Mr Zuckerberg said in advance of the event that the challenge of the conference would be ensuring that the company could still use it to introduce new products, even while apologising for the damage that its old ones have done. That\u0027s going to be what this whole conference is about, he told Wired.Once the discussion of recent events was out of the way, the new product launches were plentiful.The company revealed that it will add group video chat options to WhatsApp, for instance, allowing people to call numerous people at once. And it will continue its focus on allowing people to chat with businesses, too.It also showed off a new version of Facebook Messenger, with a vastly slimmed down interface. It will now open to show a list of people that users could chat with – and add new options, including a dark mode.Instagram also received new updates, including a group video chat feature that allows people to virtually meet up with friends and scroll through their timeline at the same time. The new feature will bring up a live video feed of a person or group of people, so that users can scroll through Instagram together, even if they are physically apart.(That part of the conference also saw a brief cameo from Jiffpom, a small dog that has almost 9 million followers and which Instagram said is the most famous pet on its platform.)Facebook itself got a major update intended to take on dating apps like Tinder. The new dating platform – which will live in the main Facebook app but will be separate from it – sent shares in rival companies spiralling.And it introduced a new Oculus Go headset, too. Even that headset wil include its own video chat, coming with a new version of Oculus Rooms, which allows people to speak and interact together in a virtual space.The Oculus Go was first announced in October and is the first high-end standalone virtual reality headset of its kind, with the display and computing power built directly into the headset.Until now, virtual reality systems have required a wired connection to a PC or games console, or in the case of some more budget wireless devices use a smartphone slotted into the device to act as the screen.The technology giant confirmed the launch of the much-anticipated headset at Facebook\u0027s annual developer conference, F8.The £199 device includes a built-in LCD screen and integrated speakers on either side of the headset, and also comes with a wireless controller to help users navigate through the headset\u0027s interface.But it was notable that no brand new hardware was announced at the event. It was strongly rumoured that Facebook could be introducing a home assistant at F8 – but that appeared to have been pulled given the increased wariness about giving Facebook access to personal data.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This crime is complex and a piecemeal approach will not cut it. Police warn modern slaves ‘staffing nail bars across UK’ as Vietnamese gang jailed in landmark case“The government must get a grip on what works and what doesn’t – when things change, it must be sufficiently informed and agile to respond.”Ms Hillier said long waits for officials to make decisions on whether people should be treated as victims of modern slavery was compounding their distress, while monitoring of support services is poor and there are “worrying variations” in the response of local police forces.“Brexit may complicate the picture further and it is critical that government acts swiftly on the concerns set out in our report,” she added.The Modern Slavery Strategy was introduced in 2014 to reduce the prevalence of practices including human trafficking, forced labour, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude.Gang members who used teenager ‘as a commodity’ to deal drugs jailedAnyone can report potential victims to the National Referral Mechanism for their cases to be assessed, but the system is inefficient and leaves slaves waiting for too long to receive help, the Public Accounts Committee said. Care has been contracted out to the Salvation Army for £90m until 2020, but there are no minimum standards, formal inspections or deadlines for when a decision should be made, with the current average standing at 134 days. The committee warned that prevention work was being damaged by slow progress understanding the crime, which is evolving quickly with changing techniques and nationalities involved. MPs attacked the government’s “hands-off approach” to how businesses comply with laws on transparency in supply chains, which were introduced in 2015, saying monitoring was being left to charities, investors and customers themselves.They said the approach was “clearly not working” because only an estimated 30 per cent of businesses required by law to publish a commitment on the issue have done so. There are also extreme variations between the number of modern slaves being reported by the 43 police forces in England and Wales, varying between more than 900 and fewer than 10 since the National Referral Mechanism started in 2009.MPs said the figures suggested some forces were not treating the issue as seriously as others, with only 6 per cent of related crimes recorded in the year to March 2017 leading to charges and dedicated funding running out in a year’s time.Modern Slavery in the UKModern Slavery in the UKNCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitation\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – but\u0026#13Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.\u0026#13In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.\u0026#13Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.\u0026#13The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Spot the signs of forced prostitution:\u0026#13Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:\u0026#13Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.\u0026#13The committee said the Home Office must work with groups including the National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service and independent anti-slavery commissioner to urgently develop a set of practical steps tackling regional gaps.It demanded “immediate action” to enforce rules on transparency in supply chains, potentially including publishing a list of firms who are not complying.MPs called on the Home Office to ensure a reformed referral mechanism is in place by January next year, cut waiting times, bring in standards for victim care and a means of tracking the amount of public money spent.The committee also said better understanding was needed to prevent modern slavery and work must take account of the potential impact of Brexit. Police failure to tackle modern slavery laid bareThe Local Government Association said the National Referral Mechanism could not manage the number of cases, which has almost trebled since 2013, and backed calls for reforms.The chair of its Safer and Stronger Communities Board, Simon Blackburn, said: “These reforms must be backed up with resources. “Councils can play a key role in supporting trafficking victims, but we would like to see the government provide clarity over how local authorities are expected to respond and for these responsibilities to be properly funded.”The Public Accounts Committee report came four months after a separate probe by the National Audit Office found the government’s bid to tackle modern slavery was ineffective, calling its strategy “unclear” and “inadequate”.A previous warning came from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in October, when the watchdog found police forces were failing to identify victims and leaving perpetrators free to continue to exploit them.The UK is the first country in the world to have dedicated legislation in place to tackle modern slavery and there are more than 600 live modern slavery police operations underway.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Public Accounts Committee recognises that the UK is ahead of many countries in responding to modern slavery and the government’s Modern Slavery Taskforce will consider its recommendations carefully. “We have recently announced reforms to the National Referral Mechanism to make sure it supports more victims at a quicker pace and we are taking action to eradicate modern slavery from the economy, including requiring large businesses to report on how they are tackling and preventing this crime in their supply chains.”And last April, the Work and Pensions Committee found that “inexcusable” shortcomings in the UK’s modern slavery strategy were leaving victims reduced to destitution while their abusers escaped because they were not adequately supported to testify against them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“Crunch time is coming on what our future customs arrangements with the EU should look like. However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest.”Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “The Prime Minister is kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together. It cannot and will not work.”The clock is ticking, because the EU has demanded answers on how future customs arrangements can avoid a hard border in Ireland by June - having rejected both of No 10\u0027s proposals.The ERG has sent the prime minister a 30-page report setting out why her customs partnership is unacceptable, amid hints of withdrawing support for Brexit legislation unless it is scrapped.Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, has refused to rule out resigning over the controversy – and Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, has also made a definitive break from the customs union a red line.Brexit talks to resume this week after EU warning on Irish borderTheresa May vows to overturn Lords plan which could stop BrexitLords votes to kill off any prospect of a \u0027no deal\u0027 BrexitBrussels warns Sajid Javid of \u0027concerns\u0027 with EU citizens registerBrexit result tainted by Cambridge Analytica scandal, says Tory MPJacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG’s leader, said the partnership plan was “deeply unsatisfactory, flawed and not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.However, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he insisted he was “not in the business of making threats” to Ms May, adding: “There is no question of there being an ultimatum.“It’s not a revolver, it’s not a duelling pistol, it’s an important contribution to the debate,” Mr Rees-Mogg said, of the ERG’s report.The customs partnership would, if Britain cut tariffs in the future, see a new tracking system allow importers to claim back a refund from the government if their goods were destined for the UK market.No 10 believes the plan offers the best hope of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, but it would be complicated to administer and could take at least five years to introduce. Eurosceptics fear it is doomed to fail – which would allow the EU to push Britain into staying in a customs union even after the 21-month transition period.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish. It wasn’t the biggest shock to them.Again this description seems at odds with the portrait of the naïve and lonely girl that Jade also likes to paint of her past self.Either way, today Jade likes to think of herself as an entrepreneur as well as a porn performer.She has given up travelling to shoots and instead works from her Manchester flat creating her own content, which she sells to subscribers.I work three days a week from my own home and while I’m not rich I’m not poor. For me it’s not about the money, she says. It’s about doing something I enjoy.Is there a sell-by date on what she does? Who knows?, she asks. I live each day by the day. What about regret in the future? After all, the 60-year-old Jade might feel differently about what she did as a young girl.Maybe but I don’t think so, she says. I like to think that I’ll enjoy seeing how hot I was.I am proud of what I do. I honestly think that discovering the porn industry made me the person I am today, and I couldn’t be more grateful.Jade features in Jade: Why I Chose Porn on BBC iPlayer and Things Not To Say To Someone Who Works In Porn on BBC Three’s YouTube channelOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And this is true across the animal kingdom - its not limited to primates - and humans do the same thing.When we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite.We close up and make ourselves small.But its not just about projecting power over other people - Amy says we can fake it till we make it and convince ourselves that we are more confident and dominant just by consciously adopting a bold power stance.When you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful, she explains.Powerful people tend to be more assertive, confident and optimistic, and they take more risks.The body can shape the mind. In her own research, Amy has taken groups of people and asked them to adopt high or low-power poses, without telling them why.The famous legs-spread Tory stance is an example of a high-power pose, while low-power poses could include seated positions with the limbs tucked in.After two minutes in this pose, subjects were asked to play a gambling game, and the choices of the high-power and low-power groups were compared.Cuddy found that 85 per cent of the people primed by just two minutes in a power pose were prepared to take risks, while just 60 per cent of the low-power group took the same risks.By swabbing the mouth before and after a two-minute pose, researchers also found that testosterone, the male sex hormone associated with physical strength, increases by 20 per cent after adopting a high-power pose.This is true of both men and women, meaning anyone can gain a rush of masculine power just by standing with your legs spread.And on the flip side, testosterone levels tend to dip by around 10 per cent after two minutes spent in a low-power pose.Meanwhile, cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, decrease after a few minutes in a dominant pose, and rise after taking a cowering, submissive pose.In another test, Cuddy put a group of people through a mock job interview, with half of the group spending a few minutes in a power pose before they went in, and the other half adopting a low-power pose while waiting for the interview to start.She found that the people who had prepared with a power pose were more likely to get positive feedback from the test interview - suggesting that power stances can be useful to boost your own confidence, as well as to project your confidence to the world.By taking an exaggerated Javid-style power stance (sometimes dubbed the Wonder Woman pose) before you go into a meeting or give a speech you can improve your own confidence and presence.It can also make you come across as more comfortable, passionate and authentic - which explains why its so popular among big-name politicians.However, Cuddy explains that youre not necessarily meant to strike this exaggerated power pose while youre delivering a big speech - as Tory ministers are prone to doing.Its more something which you should do for yourself, in private, to gee yourself up before a big event.As Cuddy says: For two minutes before you go into a high-stress situation, try doing this: in an elevator, in a bathroom stall or at your desk, behind closed doors.Configure your brain to do the best in that situation and get your testosterone up.Of course, you dont have to be a government minister to benefit from this psychological boost - anyone can try a few minutes of power posing before a stressful or intimidating event.Just take a moment to privately adopt a big, space-hogging Alpha pose, and youll find that youre that bit more calm and composed when it comes to crunch time.Cuddy says: Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. You dont just fake it till you make it, you can actually fake it until you become it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They told her that I was wanted by the Home Office for deportation.“She told me that she had to suspend me because they had told her that that they could be prosecuted and fined if they kept me on the books.”It then took him several days to get through to the Home Office - leaving him unable to work during that time.He said that when he got through: “I explained the situation.I was hysterical. I told him that the idea of me being deported to Uganda was ridiculous.“I was passed on to a manager who said that they had no idea how or why it had happened.”Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary on Sunday night in the wake of the Windrush generation crisis.Today it was claimed that up to 7,000 foreign students may have been wrongly accused of cheating and kicked out of Britain.A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Mr Herbert was sent a letter in May 2015 incorrectly warning that he was the subject of enforcement action.“When the mistake was identified in October 2015, we wrote to Mr Herbert to acknowledge the error and apologise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402206917.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pension watchdog faces calls to investigate sainsburys tie up with asda to stop workers being left out of pocket","story":"Labour’s Frank Field called on Sainsbury’s chief Mike Coupe - panned for singing We’re in the Money over the deal – to prove that staff won’t be left out of pocket once the merger is complete.And he said the regulator also had to be given a veto on the historic supermarket deal.Speaking to The Sun, Mr Field, head of the cross-party Commons Work and Pension Committee said: “The living standard of hundreds of thousands of worker and pensioners are on the line.“Given that both companies’ pension schemes have significant accounting deficits, it seems to be as clear as day that the deal should proceed only once it’s been cleared by The Pensions Regulator.”The Labour campaigner said Sainsbury’s had a near £1billion black hole in its pension scheme while Asda’s was almost £900million in the red.Sainsbury’s is washing its hands of Asda’s scheme under the merger plans – with the obligation for funding Asda retirement pots left with former owner, US giant Walmart.Walmart will get £3billion in cash under the merger.In a letter to Mike Coupe, Mr Field asks if there is any specific provision under the deal to include a “specific provision” for Sainsbury’s pension scheme members.And he asks: “What risk analysis have you undertaken regarding the deal’s impact on the covenant underpinning the Sainsbury’s defined benefit regimes?”Frank Field’s Commons Ccmmittee went to war with Sir Philip Green over the collapse of BHS. The billionaire in February agreed to write a £363million cheque to shore up the high street chain’s pension fund.Last month, the Government dropped plans to give the Pensions Regulator power to stop mergers or takeovers that threaten the solvency of a UK retirement fund. The power would have worked in a similar way to the “fit and proper person” test applied by the Football Association on foreign takeovers of English clubs.Explaining the U-turn, Government sources explained that Ministers had sought to strike a balance between supporting pensioners and allowing British companies to “grow and prosper”.Mr Coupe was caught singing We’re in the Money on TV as Sainsbury’s shares soared 17 per cent on the merger plan with long-time rival Asda.The chief exec didn’t realise his rendition of the Gold Diggers’ Song was being recorded by ITV. Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself before an interview on ITV about the merger.It came as critics claimed the merger could lead to widespread store closures and job losses – as well as a thumping for suppliers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But if we don’t get access, we will find an alternative.”The Commission wrote to ministers in January saying Britain would not be able to stay in the Galileo satellite system for data security reasons.But that letter is being kept under lock and key in the Secretariat General, which is now run by all-powerful German official Martin Selmayr who has taken a hard line on Brexit.And it is understood that chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team were left out of the process as the Commission insisted Britain will be cut adrift after we’ve left.The revelations came after diplomats from the 27 Member States gathered last Thursday to discuss the latest Brexit developments.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “The UK has sent a letter to the Commission outlining its wishes and the Commission has reacted to that not from Barnier’s end but from the Secretariat-Gerneral’s.“That [Commission] letter has never been seen by the Member States.”A second EU diplomat confirmed: “We’d like to get a copy of the letter that was sent to the UK.”A Commission source said the meeting had focussed on the security-related aspects of shutting the UK out of Galileo, a move which could cost British businesses hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson has reacted furiously to the Commission’s snub and ministers are now mulling building our own rival satellite.But one EU diplomat added: “I think in the end the two parties will reach an agreement so that the UK can still participate in it.“The UK is leaving and that has consequences — you can’t expect everything to just keep on going on the same footing. But this is a negotiation and it’s still ongoing.”The £8.8 billion Galileo satellite is a rival to America’s GPS system and plays an especially important role in military operations. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The move could see prices rise by up to 24p a litre.Jamie said: “There is some logic to opening it out to milk products.” He added junk food two-for-one deals should be allowed only if there was an equal number on healthy items.And Hugh said GPs need to start routinely weighing patients to get people talking about obesity.But Christopher Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Some people will only be happy when nobody can afford to buy any treats any more.”The second stage of the Government’s childhood obesity strategy is expected to include some of the calls when it is unveiled later this year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said it was unclear why we lose our ability to pick up languages after 18.Scientists suggest it may be due to brain changes – or becoming too busy to learn.Researcher Josh Tenenbaum, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences, said: “It’s possible that there’s a biological change. It’s also possible that it’s something social or cultural. There’s roughly a period of being a minor that goes up to about age 17 or 18 in many societies.“After that, you leave your home, maybe you work full time, or you become a specialised university student.

almost two thirds revealed their affection for their childhood dwellings is entwined with fond memories of their formative years.Four in ten said the place they grew up in was special because they were able to spend more time together with their family and 56 per cent said they felt safer there.Researchers made this discovery after polling 2,000 UK adults.Commissioned by leading door and window brand, Origin, the research found 38 per cent think their current home lacks the ‘magic’ of their childhood home.Amid this, almost one in ten have even taken steps to make their current dwellings more like the home they grew up in – including replicating the décor and furnishings.Ben Brocklesby, director at Origin, said: “Our work is centred around creating beautiful homes for our customers and their families, but we were curious to find out more about the stories our homes tell and what special ingredients are needed to really make a house a home.“Interestingly, our research has shown that it’s the small details that stay with us and it is these little quirks that really make a house a true home, even after we have moved on and into a new property.”The research also found the garden is the most fondly remembered aspect of our childhood homes.Other enduring memories include the view from the windows, mum’s cooking and laughing together as a family.It also emerged those polled believe homes ‘tell a story’ about the lives of the people living there - whether it be height markings on doorframes, family photographs or holiday souvenirs.Three in ten said they would go as far as to buy the home they grew-up in if they could and 49 per cent said they felt happier living there than at any other time of their lives.In fact, the impact of our childhood home is so significant, that those polled think about events from way back around three times a month on average.The most common memory triggers are songs, the smell of a roast dinner and the comforting aroma of baking.Some even associate the sound of a gravel drive, the ring of a doorbell and the feel of a carpet with the place they grew up in.Visit here for further information on Origin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402950068.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"us mexico border smugglers baby tiger duffel bag","story":"Officials say the cub had been sedated and was lucky to be alive after being stuffed into a holdall.According to Fox 8, the baby tiger was discovered after a suspicious bag was spotted along Americas border with Mexico.Border patrol officers stumbled across the abandoned black duffel bag on Monday and were left horrified by its contents.While people trafficking and drug smuggling are rife along the US-Mexico border, animal smuggling is rare.According to Fox 8, the agents saw three people attempting to enter the United States illegally, through Brownsville, Texas.When they were spotted, the men dropped the bag and apparently fled back to Mexico.When agents approached the bag and carefully opened it, they were shocked to find the unconscious male tiger cub stuffed inside.The cub was turned over to the Gladys Porter Zoo where veterinary doctors fought to save his life.In a Facebook post alongside a picture of the now healthy cub, the Gladys Porter Zoo said: The tiger cub found in a duffel bag at the border is under the care of our veterinary staff.“Despite him being brought to us in a critical condition, our veterinary team acted quickly to stabilize him and he is now doing very well.“He is thought to be around 2 months of age.“The way he responds to humans leads us to believe that he has been hand-raised up until this point.“The next step will be to find him a more permanent home.The discovery comes just weeks after President Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops along the Mexican border.The Trump administration claimed to be working with the governors of the four southwestern US states along the border to deploy the Guard, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.She added that the troops would not be involved in law enforcement.The Guard will most likely help US Customs and Border Protection personnel to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country.In response, the Mexican government told the United States that “if the announced deployment of the National Guard turned into a militarisation of the border, it would gravely damage the bilateral relationship.”Plans to deploy the National Guard come after Trump failed to persuade both the Mexican Government and the US Congress to fully fund his plans for a wall along the border."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401028895.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"princess charlotte birthday third palace royals prince louis","story":"The charismatic three-year-old delighted royal fans when she proudly waved from outside the Lindo Wing as Prince William took her and Prince George to see the newborn.Unlike her older brother George, Charlotte embraced the limelight -

They helped me realise the bigger picture about my anxiety and depression. That it was about losing control and an identity crisis.I started to get better, and started to talk to mum friends about my experience. I found that so many of my friends had experienced similar struggles themselves.And that in itself made me feel a bit better. Not because they suffered too but because it showed that they understood.I studied at Oxford University, worked as a strategy consultant at one of the big four consultancies, and then spent nearly five years in supply chain at drinks company, Innocent. I actually tried going back to work - I did a bit of consultancy, and also had a part-time job at a small start-up local to me.But it didn\u0027t work for me. I loved the work and the people, but for some reason having to be at a set place at a set time, and feeling guilty whether I was at work or home that I should be doing the other, really set my PND off again. So in the end I left as I felt I was letting them down.It was the best decision I made though. As soon as I felt the weight of work off my shoulders I could concentrate on getting better.Since then I have been creating my own silver lining. I am now on a mission to ensure that no other mum should have to feel like I did. This started by speaking out about my experience.I also found that loneliness can be a cause of PND and other mental health issues, so I am excited that my MummyLinks App, designed as a safe place to meet mums for local playdates, is launching this summer.This week I also launched the #ShoutieSelfie campaign on social media to support and encourage people to get talking about mental health during and after pregnancy.Out of three mums, one will be struggling with a mental health issue.Do you know which of your friends who are mums are struggling?"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/16/04/2048x1152/rbs-1-2048x1536_3443150.jpg?20160405114748 ","title":"revealed how many hours it takes to make a friend","story":"Hours spent working together just don\u0027t count as much. You can spend over 250 hours with someone at work over three months and still feel they are just an acquaintance.No wonder it is so hard to make new friends, especially after university.No wonder children and work make it difficult to do this. Who has the time?No wonder we want to make relationships move faster by sharing intimacy and connection online.Yet, my study only counted co-present - not mediated - time. After a friendship is established, mediated moments of social interaction (like those spent on Facebook) can make a difference.Don\u0027t just take it from me.David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook, notes: \"When people are engaging with people they\u0027re close to, it\u0027s more meaningful, more fulfilling. It\u0027s good for your well-being.\" Facebook\u0027s own research concludes that direct social interaction with people who matter most to us makes the biggest difference. But you have to make those friends first.I guess like everything in this life, if you want friends (and truly they are the best), you need to put in a lot of hours in their company. You have to work at it.This project draws from ideas advanced by University of Oxford researcher Robin Dunbar who established that a person\u0027s brain can only handle about 150 friendships.The amount of time and the type of activity shared with a friend is often pleasurable in its own right, but it is also a strategic investment in the future of feeling included and connected in one\u0027s social circle.My second study followed 112 University of Kansas first years for nine weeks.I asked them about two people they had met since starting school two weeks before, and then I checked up with them four and seven weeks later to see how those two relationships had progressed.In both studies I asked participants to describe their new relationships in one of four deepening stages: acquaintance, casual friend, friend, and close friend.Then I estimated the statistical cut-point, or the place where people began to transition from one level of friendship to another.Combining the results of both studies, I estimate it takes between 40 and 60 hours to form a casual friendship, 80-100 hours to transition to being a friend, and more than 200 hours to become close friends.Of course, it\u0027s not simply a matter of wanting to be friends with someone. The other person has to want it, too.And younger people would be wise to make that investment of time: friendship earlier in life is associated with happiness later in life. Although you can\u0027t make people spend time with you, you can invite them.Make it a priority to spend time with potential friends. If you are interested in a friendship, switch up the context. If you work together, go to lunch or out for a drink.These things signal to people that you are interested in being friends with them.The message is clear: we have to put that time in. You can\u0027t snap your fingers and make a friend.And it is very important to prioritise friendships. Maintaining close relationships is the most important investment of our time we can make - most people on their deathbeds agree."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-front-pages-national-newspapers_4298499.jpg?20180501221626 ","title":"what benjamin netanyahu wants to achieve with his iran stunt","story":"The boys and girls from Mossad had managed to make off with \"half a ton\" of documents, files, CDs and data, which was described as Iran\u0027s nuclear archive.And they were now being presented to the world in a grand \"I told you so\" moment.This was proof, it was claimed, that Iran was \"brazenly lying\" about its military nuclear programme, which it had developed extensively until 2003, and even now in 2018, was still active.Israel claims the intelligence swag shows unequivocally that Iran is in breach of the nuclear agreement brokered in 2015, and it should be ripped up.Under the terms of the deal the country agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.The Israeli leader, though, has always been against the agreement and many people will interpret this intervention as primarily political. The signatories of the Iran deal were well aware that Iran had an active nuclear programme until 2003.That was why the Vienna agreement was so important - it may not be ideal, but at least it stops Iran from building a bomb for at least the next decade.He could push, for instance, for curbs to Iran\u0027s ballistic missile programme, and for Tehran to desist from sponsoring Shiite militias in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.That route appears less likely.The US leader, in reacting to the intel reveal, said it proved he was \"100% right\" all the time when he called the deal flawed.But Bibi\u0027s Ted Talk-style presentation also had a subtext that is easily missed.If the world does not act against Iran to stop what Israel calls its aggression across the region, Israel will act - and it would seem increasingly it has the backing of the US to make that fight."}]
