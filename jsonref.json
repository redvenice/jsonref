The kapo looked Fritz in the eye. ‘If you want to go on living, you have to forget your father.’‘That’s impossible,’ he replied. After a few days of agonising, he returned to the kapo with an extraordinary request: ‘I need you to pull whatever strings you can to get me on the Auschwitz transfer.’The kapo was aghast. ‘What you’re asking is suicide.’ But Fritz was adamant. ‘I want to be with my papa, no matter what happens. I can’t go on living without him.’And so it was that two days later, Fritz and Gustav were herded on to a cattle wagon – their destination a place synonymous with murder on an industrial scale.There are many Holocaust stories, but not like the tale of Gustav and Fritz Kleinmann. Not only did they experience the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps from the first mass arrests in the late 1930s all the way through to eventual liberation, but they went through the whole inferno together, father and son. That makes them unique.More than luck or circumstance, it was their love and devotion to each other that kept them alive. ‘The boy is my greatest joy,’ Gustav wrote in his secret diary. ‘We strengthen each other. We are one, inseparable.’The doctor double act who can help you live healthier for...Trial for HIV prevention drug PrEP could DOUBLE after...Share this articleTogether, they endured a six-year odyssey through the hell of the camps, beginning with three years at Buchenwald, where Gustav so nearly became one of the tens of thousands to die in its unimaginably harsh conditions. Yet, however remarkable their story would prove to be, before the Nazis tore them apart there was nothing unusual about Gustav’s family.A decorated hero of the Great War, Gustav had married his sweetheart Tini and they were raising their four children – Fritz, Edith, Herta and Kurt – in a small apartment in Vienna, where he worked as a master upholsterer. Everything changed in March 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. Under the Nuremberg Laws, Austrian Jews were stripped of their citizenship. In April that year, Fritz, then 14 and training to enter his father’s trade, was expelled from the Trade School. Gustav’s workshop was seized. Those caught buying from Jews were made to stand with a sign: ‘I am an Aryan, but a swine – I bought this in a Jewish shop.’A month later, the family dressed in their best outfits for a photograph. The photographer caught Gustav’s apprehensiveness and the stoicism of Tini’s dark eyes. It had been Tini’s urging that had brought them to the studio. She had a foreboding that the family might not be together for much longer and wanted to capture her children’s image while she had the chance.The hammer blow came on a Sunday in September 1939, when Tini was in the apartment with Herta, Fritz and Kurt. Four men arrived, all neighbours. All were working men like Gustav – friends with wives she knew, whose children had once played with hers.‘We want your husband,’ one said. ‘We have orders. If he isn’t here, we’re to take the lad.’ He nodded at Fritz. Tini felt as if she’d been physically beaten. They took hold of her precious boy and marched him out.When Gustav returned and heard what had happened, he turned around and headed for the door, intending to go straight to the police. Tini grabbed his arm. ‘Don’t,’ she said. ‘They’ll take you.’‘I’m not leaving Fritzl in their hands,’ he replied.‘No!’ Tini pleaded. ‘You have to run away, go somewhere and hide.’But there was no dissuading him. Leaving Tini in tears, Gustav walked quickly to the police station and announced: ‘I’m Gustav Kleinmann. I’m here to turn myself in. You have my son. Take me and let him go.’ The policeman glanced around. ‘Get the hell out of here,’ he muttered.Bewildered, Gustav left the building. He went home to find Tini distraught that Fritz was still gone. ‘I’ll try again tomorrow,’ Gustav said. But at 2am, a tide of men surged into the apartment. There was weeping, there were pleas, and final desperate words between husband and wife. And then it was all over. The door slammed, and Gustav was gone.Each morning, an hour and a half before dawn, shrill whistles yanked the prisoners from their sleep. Then came the kapos, yelling at them to hurry.Outside, Buchenwald was ablaze with electric light along the fence lines, atop the guard towers and in the walkways. People were herded to the square for roll call, standing motionless and shivering in their pitiful clothes for two hours. When it was time to go to work, sunrise was beginning to lighten the landscape.Gustav and Fritz had been assigned to the quarry detail, working as wagon haulers. All day, they and 14 other men had to heave and push a laden wagon weighing around four and a half tons up the hill, a distance of more than 800 yards, lashed and yelled at by kapos. Falls were frequent, with fractured limbs and broken heads. The injured would be taken to the infirmary or, if they were Jews, to the Death Block – a holding barrack for the terminally sick.Gustav and Fritz toiled on day after day, miraculously managing to avoid both punishment and injury. ‘We are proving ourselves,’ Gustav wrote in his diary.But things turned very different one day in November, after a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in Munich. When the prisoners lined up in the square, the kapos went along the ranks, grabbing every 20th man and shoving him forward. One of them was Fritz.A heavy wooden table with straps dangling from it was dragged on to the square. The Bock – the whipping bench. Fritz’s jacket and shirt were removed and his trousers pulled down. Gustav watched helplessly as the first lash landed like a razor cut across Fritz’s buttocks.‘Count!’ they yelled at their victim. ‘One,’ Fritz said. The bull-whip cut across his flesh again. ‘Two,’ he gasped. Fritz struggled to concentrate, knowing that if he lost count the lashes would start over again.At last the count reached 25 the strap was loosened and he was forced to his feet. Before his father’s eyes he was helped away, bleeding, his body on fire with pain, his mind stunned as the next unfortunate was dragged to the Bock.Despite his agony, Fritz was more worried about his papa than about himself. Dysentery and fever plagued the camp, and now the older man had caught the sickness.During roll call he swayed, shivering, his senses failing. He was unconscious before he hit the ground. When he woke, he was on his back. In his hazy, febrile state, Gustav dimly realised that he must be in the block set aside for hopeless cases, from which people rarely emerged alive. The Death Block. The air was thick, stifling, filled with groans and an atmosphere of hopelessness.As the days wore on, Fritz visited his papa whenever he could. The dysentery had failed to kill him, and the worst had passed.However, it was obvious to Gustav that he would never get well in this environment. After two weeks, Gustav begged to be discharged, but doctors wouldn’t let him go. He was far too weak to survive. Gustav was determined and asked Fritz to help him to his feet. With Fritz guiding his papa’s faltering steps, father and son slipped out of the Death Block together.It was October 1942 when they arrived at the most notorious of all the camps. Fritz had been allowed to go with his father and on their journey to Auschwitz, Gustav wrote: ‘Everyone is saying it is a journey to death, but Fritzl and I do not let our heads hang down. I tell myself that a man can only die once.’Fritz saw the marks of abuse and the signs of impending death in all his fellow prisoners, including himself: bruises, broken bones, sores, scabs and gapped teeth.The prisoners were able to shower once a week, but it was an ordeal. After showering, only the first men out got dry towels, so if you lagged behind you got nothing but a soaking rag and had to walk back to the barrack dripping, even in the coldest winter weather. Pneumonia was endemic, and often fatal. Food was distributed in the barrack. Only a few bowls were provided, so the first to get their helping of soup had to wolf it down so as not to keep the others waiting. If you managed to acquire your own spoon, you would guard it with your life.Having a decent pair of shoes was essential. If they were too large or too small, they chafed and caused blisters. Socks were rare, and many substituted strips of fabric torn from the tails of their camp-issue shirts. This in itself was risky, because damaging SS property was classed as sabotage.Gustav and Fritz were sent to a sub-camp within Auschwitz called Monowitz. Within weeks, most of their Buchenwald comrades had been sent to their deaths, but – against the odds – the pair had managed to survive as a result of their useful labouring skills. Fritz had been building the new camp, while his father had worked as a carpenter and upholsterer.Despite the overwhelming danger, Fritz became involved in a covert resistance against the SS, passing information to other prisoners about progress of the war, details he’d picked up from the civilians he worked with.One day he was seized, driven from the camp and accused by the head of the Auschwitz Gestapo of planning a large-scale escape, which he knew nothing about.He was lashed again, this time 60 times. Still he refused to name friends involved in the resistance.          Fritz, 17, at Buchenwald in 1940Fritz was allowed to return to camp, but fearing the Gestapo would return to look for him, his comrades came up with a daring plan: they hid him in an isolation room in the hospital, and recorded his death with the authorities. Weeks passed as Fritz recovered, now with a new identity – taken from a deceased typhus patient –and a new job as a warehouseman. So horrific was the death rate at Auschwitz that few prisoners were easily recognisable.Yet not knowing the truth, his father’s agony continued.One evening a friend came to see Gustav. ‘Follow me,’ he indicated, and led the older man down away from the road and towards the bathing block.In the low light inside, he saw the outline of a man standing back in the shadows. The figure came forward, his features resolving into the face of Fritz. It was miraculous. For Gustav, to hold his son in his arms again, to inhale the smell of him, to hear his voice, was beyond hope, beyond everything.Together they remained until January 1945, when Auschwitz was evacuated as Russian troops neared. They and thousands of other prisoners were forced to trudge through the snow, away from the advancing Red Army.Then they were put on trains bound for camps deeper inside the Reich. Their destination was Mauthausen in Austria, but father and son had decided to seize the chance to make their escape.When it came to it, Gustav, 53 years old and exhausted, didn’t have the strength to attempt it. Yet he couldn’t deny his son the chance to live. It would be a wrenching pain to part, but he urged Fritz to go alone.Fritz embraced his papa, and with his help climbed the slippery side wall of the wagon. He peered anxiously towards the brake houses on the adjacent wagons, occupied by armed SS guards. The train was thundering along at its maximum speed. Screwing up his courage, Fritz launched himself into the night and the rushing, freezing air.          Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland was infamous for the horror what went on insideFritz’s brave escape would not succeed, however. Despite his father’s fervent prayers, he was recaptured and imprisoned in Mauthausen – although the train itself was then erted and took Gustav to a different camp, Mittelbau-Dora. Father and son spent three months praying the other had been able to cling to life.And their prayers were answered. Mittelbau-Dora was liberated by US troops in April Mauthausen in May. When Fritz was first checked into an evacuation hospital, his weight was recorded as 5st 7lb, but he gradually regained strength. He returned home to Vienna, but found himself alone: his mother and sister Herta had been murdered by the Nazis, while Kurt had found sanctuary in America and Edith in England. He had no idea if his father was alive.It was September by the time Gustav, too, finally made his way home and went to the apartment building where his workshop used to be. There he found the one person he most longed to see: his beloved boy.They wept tears of joy. They were home and together again.© Jeremy Dronfield, 2019Extracted from The Boy Who Followed His Father Into Auschwitz, by Jeremy Dronfield, which is published by Michael Joseph on January 24, priced £12.99.

BBC correspondent Frank Gardner was shot six times by militants while reporting in Saudi Arabia in 2004The company has denied any link between the yellow fever vaccine and Mr Brabant\u0027s hallucinations. Trine Villemann told the Sunday Times: \u0027I thought I\u0027m sure the vaccine maker would like to see this, to understand what is happening.\u0027If you buy a bad burger all hell breaks loose.

He said let\u0027s make a deal,\u0027 Graham said on \u0027Fox New Sunday.\u0027The senator from South Carolina also urged a breathing period of three weeks where the government would reopen while both sides negotiation a price tag for the president\u0027s border wall.\u0027I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can\u0027t at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That\u0027s my recommendation,\u0027 Graham said.Last week House Democrats passed inidual appropriations bills to open each Cabinet department that is closed. Those are unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, however.Lawmakers are scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Monday although it\u0027s unclear if that will be affected by the snow storm that hit Washington D.C. None of the votes scheduled in the House or Senate for Monday evening deal with reopening the government. No meetings between the White House and Democrats are scheduled after Trump walked out of a sit down last week.  The president and Democrats are head locked over funding for his border wall. Trump wants the full $5.7 billion it would take to build it while Democrats are sticking to the $1.3 billion they\u0027ve offered for border security.The president has tweeted his willingness to talk to Democrats and called into Fox News\u0027 Jeanne Pirro Saturday night to say he\u0027s ready to work with the other side.\u0027It would take me 15 minutes to get a deal done, and everybody could go back to work.

And I\u0027m just so frustrated we can\u0027t get in a room and hammer it out,\u0027 he said. Democrats, however, have been firm on their stance of no wall.  Trump has been just as firm that he won\u0027t sign legislation funding the government without money for his border barrier.\u0027What are we supposed to do?

When the boys and their football coach went missing in the Tham Luang cave on Saturday afternoon, doctors had told them not to worry — people could survive for days without food, as long as they had water, which the boys did.But now it was Wednesday, Day Five. Doubts were growing. Were their boys still alive? For 16-year-old Night\u0027s dad, this was when his hope started to waver. It was hard not to imagine their weak little bodies wasting away in the darkness. What were they doing? Were they scared? How long could they survive?The father of Biw had already felt despair after going into the flooded cave to help with the rescue, feeling the chill of the thin underground air and seeing the water rushing relentlessly in. But he was determined to at least bring his son\u0027s body home for a funeral.For the rescuers, conditions were not improving. The SEALs of the Thai Navy\u0027s Special Forces heading the operation set their sights on at least getting to the T-junction — a crucial landmark a mile or so inside the complex cave system that snaked through the mountain.

You\u0027re risking your life for an if...\u0027Brothers of England football stars Marcus Rashford and Trent...Share this articleThere was also a gloomy feeling among the British specialist cave ers, who\u0027d arrived to take part. Having seen how quickly the cave had flooded, they seriously doubted that the 12 boys of the Wild Boars soccer team and their coach could still be alive.Yet no one was prepared to give up. The urge everyone felt to rescue them was too strong. Thousands of people were now involved in the international operation, backed by volunteers.Food trucks, including mobile kitchens sent by the King of Thailand from his palace, served 20,000 hot meals a day. Giant vats of curry were stirred with cricket stump-sized ladles.Rescuers had their pick of batteries, socks, underwear, painkillers, balms, soap, sweets. Next to the medical tent, masseuses gave free neck rubs to relieve stress. Hairdressers offered to cut hair.Off site, more generosity went largely unseen. Hotels, resorts and village homes opened their doors for the rescue teams, providing accommodation, meals and washing clothes, also for free.  The story of the 12 Thai schoolboys trapped in a cave became a world-wide phenomenon Flagging morale among the Thais was revived when a revered Buddhist monk came, meditated at the cave entrance and appealed to the spirits of the Mountain of the Sleeping Lady to let the boys out.He declared: \u0027Don\u0027t worry — in a day or two the children will come out\u0027. When the parents heard the prediction, their hopes rose again.But the best omen of all was that the monsoon that caused the flooding had stopped and the ers could get back in the cave. Meanwhile, on the mountain, drilling teams set up machinery to bore holes, down which a microphone could be dropped to listen for life.They could only make an educated guess as to where in the cave complex the boys might be.But at the very least, they argued, they would make a racket with their drills, and the sound would vibrate and echo through the porous limestone. This would send a message to the Wild Boars that help was coming. \u0027If I was in the dark for six days,\u0027 an engineer explained, \u0027I imagine I might lose hope, so we drilled to make noise and keep the kids hopeful.\u0027And indeed, inside the cave, amid the constant dripping of water and the thuds and scrapes of their digging, sometimes the boys did hear sounds. One day, Titan thought he heard a helicopter. Biw heard a rooster crow. Another time, a dog barked — they all heard that one.          Rescuers are seen walking towards the entrance of the cave complex during the rescue operation Where were the sounds coming from? Were their minds playing tricks on them? Some of the noises gave them hope, but others scared them. On the ledge deep inside the mountain, \u0027sometimes we heard people\u0027s voices talking at the bottom of the mound but we didn\u0027t see anyone there,\u0027 said Biw.Even more frightening was the unnerving sound of someone calling their names. It summoned up Thai horror stories of ghosts. \u0027Coach Ek told us that if we hear somebody call our names at night, don\u0027t answer,\u0027 said Biw.There, inside the cave, time was running out, literally. Of the three watches the boys went in with, only one was still working but it at least enabled them to have some kind of routine in the darkness.In the morning, they would fill their stomachs with the water running off the stalactites and then head to the top of the slope to dig at the back, in the hope of finding a route out. When 16-year-old Tee\u0027s watch told them it was night, they lay down on the hard dirt to sleep.It wasn\u0027t comfortable, and they found themselves constantly slipping down the slope.When they slept it was usually in short snatches.But there was something else that kept them awake at night. Even at home, Titan, at 11 the youngest, was a restless sleeper who would sometimes sleepwalk to the toilet. In the cave it was worse. He talked and shouted in his sleep, keeping the others awake.Sometimes he would even jump up, still fast asleep, which was annoying but also potentially deadly. If he wandered off, he might hit his head or fall into the water. So every night, Coach Ek would hold on to him, sleeping lightly, wary his youngest player might dream himself to death.          All 12 players, pictured from top left clockwise, Adul Sam-on, 14, Panumas Saengdee, 13, Sompong Jaiwong, 13, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Pipat Bodhi, 15, Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, Pornchai Kamluang, 16, Prajak Sutham, 14, Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, Nattawut \u0027Tle\u0027 Takamsai, 14 and Duangpetch Promthep, 13They still had working torches, but they rationed the light, knowing it could be many more days until they were found. Most of the time they were in a darkness so profound it felt like a physical substance, oozing around their bodies. It started to get into the boys\u0027 subconscious minds. One night, Dom dreamed he was being chased by a black tiger. Another time Titan thought Coach Ek was a warrior chasing him with a sword.The line between sleep and wakefulness was often unclear in that darkness and all the more terrifying.As the days dragged on, all of the boys had moments of despair and shed some tears. But Note wept more than the others. He simply didn\u0027t think they were going to get out alive. On July 1 it was his 15th birthday but there wasn\u0027t much to celebrate. They were alive, but for how much longer?After nine days, they were inching closer towards death, their bodies wasting away, their cheeks hollow, their skin grey. With no food to turn into energy, their bodies\u0027 normal chemical processes slowed and then shifted, seeking sustenance elsewhere. The protein in their muscles was broken down into glucose, their fat turned into fatty acids and ketone. To fuel the life-giving fundamentals, their bodies were consuming them from the inside.The heart must keep pumping blood. The brain must keep thinking. They must stay calm, conserve their energy. They must survive.For the rescuers outside, Sunday, July 1, brought a lucky break. The weather was easing. There had been no substantial rain for the past 36 hours. That afternoon, yellow measuring sticks at various points within the cave showed the water level dropping.With the cave still flooded, but the flow becoming more manageable, foreign e instructors based in Thailand volunteered to go back in to lay down hundreds of yards of guide ropes through the flooded passages, tying them to stalactites and rocks as they edged once again towards the T-junction.          Thousands of rescuers including Thai Navy SEALs and elite British ers had been working around the clock to come up with a plan to bring the exhausted and starved boys home safelyExperienced British ers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton joined them. Visibility was still poor and ing blind put them on edge. When they bumped into any object in the water they half expected it to be a body. They were constantly bracing themselves for the worst.But they were making progress and eventually battled their way through the cave to the T-junction. There was real hope at last.For the parents outside, though, the mood had turned grim again. Ten days had now gone by. It was too long. They were all miserable and exhausted, stuck in a gut-wrenching place somewhere between doubt and grief.A doctor reckoned that, after ten days without food, the chance of a child surviving was down to 10 per cent. Even those optimists in charge of the operation were wondering if it was time to switch from a rescue strategy to a recovery one. That would be a different dynamic. A rescue operation involved pushing the limits of safety and putting lives on the line for someone else\u0027s. The retrieval of bodies would be a slower effort, performed with care so as not to lose any more lives.On the other hand, the boys and the coach might still be alive. They\u0027d give it another day. This was still a rescue effort. Just.That night, it rained again, but the pumps installed in the cave did their job. The water didn\u0027t rise. The levels were finally under control. The ers pushed further on into the cave. The precise location of the Wild Boars was still a guess.Along the way though there were scattered clues such as muddy handprints on the cave wall that seemed to indicate they had turned left at the T-junction and were probably somewhere near a cavern known as Pattaya Beach.But what state would they be in? Would they even be alive?           The mission to rescue the final four boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave  seen here in a picture posted on Twitter by US billionaire Elon MuskJohn Volanthen and Rick Stanton now started from the T-junction, laying guide ropes as they went, until they came to a diamond-shaped pinch-point. They swam through it, jamming their fingers into the silt to crawl forward against the current.They reached a big sandy slope and came up for air. They had reached Pattaya Beach — the chamber where everyone expected the boys to have holed up.But the ledge was empty. No one was there.Having used a third of their air supply already, they should by rights have turned back, but they made a calculated decision to dig into their reserves of air and keep going. With time running out, they were determined to go as far as humanly possible that day.The boys had been trapped for ten days without food. The idea of stopping just short of them was preposterous, thought John. The two ers pushed on with a sense of determination, but also with dread. \u0027I was absolutely expecting to find bodies in the water floating towards me,\u0027 said John.As they entered each new sump, they had little idea what was in store. Would it be a mere puddle or a long, flooded chamber? Would it be blocked with rocks, stalactites, debris or corpses?Navigation was difficult in the murky passages and they made slow progress for 350 yards until they came to a room-sized chamber and surfaced. There was nothing on the steep muddy bank so they ed again and went on.On the next ledge along, 11-year-old Titan, the youngest of the Wild Boars, was fading, his tiny body wasting away. \u0027I felt faint, I lacked energy and I was hungry,\u0027 he recalled. He was thinking about home-cooked food.Food fantasies played on the boys\u0027 minds constantly. It had been about 245 hours since any of them had eaten. Their faces were gaunt, their cheekbones protruding.Their decline was not just physical. As another day passed, their spirits were fading, too.\u0027We were losing patience, hope, physical energy and courage. We could not do anything to help. The only thing that I could do was pray,\u0027 said Adul, the only Christian of the group.          The 11th boy to have been rescued was reportedly 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungruang (second left), whose nickname is TitanFor the team\u0027s captain Dom, tomorrow would be his 14th birthday. He rallied the boys and urged them to keep digging to break through the back wall and find a way out of the cave. He didn\u0027t know it, but his birthday present was about to come early.At around 8pm, the boys and Coach Ek were up on the ledge, some digging, others resting. \u0027At that moment, I heard people talking,\u0027 said Adul.They all froze in the darkness, straining to hear and fearing their minds were playing tricks on them. Adul grabbed a torch and took off down the slope as fast as his weak body would carry him.As he got to the edge, his legs went from under him and he slid into the water. He clambered back on the ledge, looked behind him at the water and saw, to his amazement, two men in ing gear.\u0027It was a miracle moment,\u0027 he remembered. \u0027I realised they were British and so I just said hello.\u0027By this stage, the rest of the team had scrambled to the edge.From the water, Rick Stanton counted them as they came down. As he scanned his torch across their faces, he saw they were all there. \u0027Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,\u0027 the boys chorused at him.Adul and Biw, the only two English speakers, translated for the others. Adul asked, \u0027When will we go outside?\u0027 and John had to explain that it would not be today. But many people would come to rescue them, he promised. \u0027We are just the first.\u0027The British ers hauled themselves onto the opposite bank, but to begin with stayed separated from the boys by a channel of water.It was a deliberate precaution. They had no idea what state of mind the boys and Coach Ek would be in. They feared that, starving and desperate, they might to try to rush them and grab their ing gear to escape. But after a few minutes, they quickly realised the 13 were calm and posed no threat.For the next 40 minutes, John and Rick sat with the Wild Boars on their ledge. To raise the kids\u0027 spirits, they asked them to cheer for the camera — a cheer for Thailand, a cheer for America, another for the UK, and on it went.The boys\u0027 physical condition was remarkably good. They were gaunt but uninjured and didn\u0027t appear sick. They even managed to smile, though when they did their teeth looked oversized in their pinched faces,\u0027We\u0027re hungry,\u0027 a boy pleaded. \u0027We have to eat, eat, eat!\u0027 The ers hadn\u0027t brought any food with them but promised they would send the SEALs in with supplies as soon as possible.Lowering themselves back into the water, they said farewell, and started back through the sump.Carried by the current, their journey back was quicker and slightly less arduous than it had been going.    Thailand erupts in celebrations as trapped football team is freed from cave and rescue chief praises successful missionNews of the boys being found alive had been messaged ahead of them and reached the world before they even got to the cave entrance. All around there were cheers and tears of joy. It seemed the impossible had come true.The priority now was to get back to them with food and medical supplies as soon as possible. The Thais took control and an army doctor, Dr Pak, and three SEALs headed into the cave.It was a difficult journey for them, still having to battle against the current. They were not trained cave ers, the water was cold and the e long. They suffered from cramps and were forced to rest before eventually making it to the ledge. There they reassured the boys they would remain with them as long as needed — even if that meant waiting half a year, until the cave drained.Dr Pak got to work, getting some energy and nutrients into the boys\u0027 systems without overloading them. Their small bodies were in life-support mode, slowly breaking down the fat and muscle to supply a trickle of energy, enough to keep the heart pumping and the lungs expanding.Many of the body\u0027s chemical processes had stopped, changed or reversed.They were at risk of what doctors call re-feeding syndrome — the point of starvation at which too much food too soon could kill them.A sudden rush of glucose would overload the system, sending their phosphate, potassium and magnesium levels into chaos. The result could be delirium, seizures, respiratory failure, heart failure, coma or even death.Although the boys were hungry and longed for rich pork and fast food, they had to be patient. The rescuers had brought little squeezy packets of high-energy gels. These tiny shots of life would have to suffice for now, gradually bringing their bodies back from the brink.Generally their condition was surprisingly good. The doctor examined them and found no serious injuries.

But for those responsible for getting the boys and their soccer coach out, the unalloyed pleasure didn\u0027t last long.After the news had sunk in, it was replaced by the realisation of how deep inside the mountain the boys were, and how hard it was going to be to bring them back to the surface.People had been rescued from caves, but never had such a difficult set of problems faced a rescue party — the children\u0027s ages their malnourished state the long, flooded route out the uncertainty of the weather.In an ideal world, the teams would be able to suck enough water out of the sumps for the Wild Boars to wade out the way they walked in.But this wasn\u0027t viable — some of the passages were 15ft deep, and more rain was coming.The cautious solution was to wait. The boys and Coach Ek had energy gels, medicine and company.Perhaps they should camp on that muddy bank for the next four to six months, until the rains stopped and the passages drained.The riskiest option was to try to e them out.The Wild Boars could all swim, but none had ever scuba ed. Even for a competent recreational er, the way out was treacherous. For a non-er, it would be almost impossible.All options were on the table, and all were bad.Adapted by Tony Rennell from The Cave by Liam Cochrane, published by ABC Books at £15.99.

It wasn’t the prospect of getting older that alarmed her, but that she had still not written a novel and sent it to an agent, as she had been promising herself. It was now or never, she thought, and she got to work.“I was writing in a frenzy,” says Braithwaite, speaking from her home in Lagos, Nigeria. “I asked myself: ‘Are you really going to turn 30 never having sent out a novel to an agent? You say you want to achieve this dream but you haven’t even tried!’”She didn’t expect the draft to sell. She had not written for a while and conceived the story of My Sister, the Serial Killer – a combination of deadly sexual attraction, psychosis, murder and sibling loyalty – as a way of flexing her writing muscles. “The book was a way back out of my writer’s block. I wanted to do something fun for myself.”A month later, in September 2017, she had completed the first draft for what would become her sensational debut the book sold both at home, in Nigeria, and in Britain and the US, well before she hit her milestone birthday in March last year. By last month, it had been translated into nine languages and the film rights sold to Working Title.The book is a thriller whose plot revolves around two sisters, the younger and more beautiful of whom keeps killing her boyfriends. Its sparky black comedy makes it something of a satire-meets-slasher, but its broader, more serious themes include timely explorations of violence against women and psychotic female rage.Born in Nigeria, Braithwaite shuttled between London and Lagos as she was growing up (her parents are Nigerian-born British citizens) and she now considers both cities to be home in different ways. She fell in love with poetry in her UK primary school, returning to Lagos to go to secondary school, then back to London to sit her A-levels and do a law and creative writing degree at the Kingston University. She took a job for a while as an editor in the Lagos publishing house Kachifo, but left to work on her own writing.For a time, poetry took precedence – she was among the top 10 finalists in Lagos’s Eko Poetry Slam in 2014 – but then she realised she wanted to focus on prose. In 2016, she was shortlisted for the Commonwealth short story prize for The Driver, which featured a relationship between a young woman from a wealthy Nigerian family and a chauffeur, and dealt with issues of class, wealth and exploitative love.This debut is not her first attempt at writing a full-length novel: she had already completed two novels before she began this one, but they have not been sent to an agent. The first is a romance with a tragic ending, and the second a fantasy epic which also plays with the black widow idea: “It has this tribe of Amazonian women, like the black widow spiders, who spend a lot of time going from village to village, slaughtering men.”Even though she feels that the second manuscript is too messy for publication, she hopes to return to the genre. “I’d like to try writing fantasy because it has everything – you can have crime and romance and the magic of it is that it allows you to stay connected to your childhood self.”When Alex Michaelides was growing up in Cyprus, there were long, hot summers which he and his sister would spend at the beach. The summer he turned 13, he borrowed his sister’s collection of Agatha Christie novels and read one every couple of days. “They were the first adult books I read, the first time that I’d ever disappeared into someone else’s world. Christie made me a reader and a writer.”Almost three decades later, Michaelides, 41, has written a debut novel with a narrative to rival that of his boyhood literary heroine. The Silent Patient is a taut, meticulously plotted and compelling novel that has earned advance praise from the likes of Lee Child, Stephen Fry and David Baldacci. It was the subject of a seven-way publisher auction and has so far sold in 40 foreign territories, a record for a UK debut thriller.The Silent Patient is narrated by Theo Faber, a psychotherapist determined to discover why Alicia Berenson, a famous artist accused of murdering her husband, has refused to speak since her husband’s death. The therapeutic setting was inspired by Michaelides’s own experience. “Therapy is very important to me and has been a major part of my life,” he says. “I was in inidual therapy twice a week for about 10 years and then I was in group therapy for quite a while. All the raw emotional stuff is my own. I put a lot of myself into the book.”Running through the novel is the Greek myth of Alcestis, and Euripides’s play of the same name. Michaelides says he has been “haunted” by the play since reading it at school as a teenager: “It’s something about feeling unlovable and unworthy that I related to. And a sense of being damaged, I guess. At that point in my life I felt quite damaged That’s probably why it haunted me.”The novel has already been optioned by Brad Pitt’s production company, Plan B, with Michaelides due to write the screenplay, a fitting circularity for a novelist who has spent the past 15 years working as a screenwriter.After an English degree at Cambridge University, he took a screenwriting course at the American Film Institute and embarked on a career in a film industry he found “soul destroying”. He was on the brink of giving up writing when he decided to have one last throw of the dice: “I thought, ‘Before I give up writing, I’m going to try and write the one thing I always wanted to write’, which was an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery with a deeper psychological complexity.”Novel writing, he discovered, was his natural medium: “Being able to move into someone’s head – it’s totally liberated me. In a film, you have to keep moving. In a book, you can go down rabbit holes, go into internal monologues. The opportunity to really slow down was a revelation.”In spite of the hype surrounding the novel, Michaelides is circumspect about his pre-publication success: “Even now I’m so ridiculously happy when someone says they like it.” It is a novel, he says, that asks the question: can you get over your childhood?And what’s the answer?“That if you hold yourself in awareness, then you can. Otherwise you’re destined to re-enact it.” Hannah BeckermanWhen Elizabeth Macneal was a teenager she began to collect literary classics – not in handy paperbacks like most bookworms her age, but in antique editions, which she would track down in charity shops or antiquarian bookstores. “All of my friends spent their money on alcohol and drugs and I would say, ‘Sorry, I can’t go out tonight because I’ve just bought 14 volumes of Shakespeare’.”Neatly stacked by author, they dominate the living room of her small east London house. “They are the epitome of ornament versus function. I read one of the Hardys but spilt tea on it and cracked the spine,” she says -, so her reading is now confined to humbler copies.The obsessiveness of collectors powers one strand of her debut novel, The Doll Factory, while the other centres on the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the group of precocious young painters and poets who faced down the Victorian art establishment. Though initially she assumed these two subjects belonged to different novels, gradually she realised that they dovetailed neatly in the story of a talented working-class girl who is adopted as a model by an up-and-coming artist while being stalked by a creepy taxidermist.Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais lounge in the background as the story of Iris unfolds: she is a shadow version of Lizzie Siddal, the model for Millais’s drowned Ophelia, who was also an artist in her own right. Released from the drudgery of painting the faces on children’s dolls after negotiating art lessons in exchange for modelling, Iris finds herself posing for hours on end as the mythological Queen in a grand painting which is to be entered for the Great Exhibition in 1851.Her new independence is exhilarating, dizzying, terrifying – and constantly endangered by the men she encounters along the way. “I guess for me the whole book is an exploration of freedom and imprisonment what it means to be stifled and how it feels to achieve creative and literal freedom,” says Macneal. “It’s also about what it means to be held back by both an inidual and a society that don’t seem to have room for a woman to transcend her class and gender.”Jacketed in luminous blue, and clearly targeted at fans of Tracy Chevalier’s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Jessie Burton’s The Miniaturist, the novel has a vivid energy of its own – bringing a painterly eye to the tricks of the pre-Raphaelite trade: a dash of emerald to emphasise lips a lush resinous gloss “to make the Queen’s fur-trimmed dress shine like stained glass”.It’s no surprise to find that the 30-year-old author is also an artist. She has a fully equipped pottery in her garden shed, though she came late to the artisanal life. Born and brought up in Edinburgh, the eldest of three children, she graduated from Oxford University (where her passion for Victorian clutter found its first expression in “actually a rather bad” thesis) to a job with a management consultancy.Though safe and lucrative, the job was her own version of Iris’s doll emporium, so she decided to strike out by signing up for pottery classes. “I loved the peace of it and – particularly working as part of a big company where I couldn’t even explain what I did – the satisfaction of turning this lump of earth into something useful and beautiful.”Her pots began to sell, enabling her to leave her job and pursue her other interest: writing. By the time she enrolled on a creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia she had already had two novels rejected. “I thought I’d go on the course and write some short stories,” she says, but her tutors pushed her towards another novel. She entered a Scottish prize for unpublished writers with half a manuscript, racing through the last 50,000 words after it was accepted. That early draft of The Doll Factory not only won her the Caledonia award but secured her an agent and had publishers beating at her door: 14 of them fought to win it, and television rights were snapped up.As the build-up to publication begins, she has retreated to her pottery shed, where 250 tiny saucers are cooling in a kiln – each decorated in delicate gold leaf with a wombat. Rossetti famously kept one as a pet, and a female wombat called Guinevere wreaks merry havoc in The Doll Factory, before expiring – much like Rossetti’s – after a feast of cigars and chocolate. Except the chocolate was Macneal’s own elaboration, on the advice of a vet friend, who pointed out that cigars alone would probably not have been fatal. The devil of all good historical fiction is in the detail. Claire ArmitsteadThe Confessions of Frannie Langton (Viking, April)Even though they didn’t return her affection, Sara Collins fell in love with the Victorian gothic romances she read while growing up: there wasn’t much in the likes of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre for someone born in Jamaica and raised in the Cayman Islands to identify with. All the same, when she began writing The Confessions of Frannie Langton – the story of a former slave from a Jamaican plantation accused of the murder of her master and mistress, in whose London home she is employed as a maid – Collins had the “vague idea” of doing something gothic.Around the same time, she read the biography of Francis Barber, the former slave given to Samuel Johnson, which sent her down a deep rabbit hole of stories about West Indians in England long before the Windrush generation.“I wanted a Jamaican woman in Jane Austen territory,” she says. “I wanted to see what would happen to someone like Frannie making her presence felt in these sophisticated Georgian drawing rooms.”Today, 46-year-old Collins splits her time between the Caribbean and London, “parallel lives” she’s lived since coming to boarding school in England at the age of 11. Despite her love affair with novels, she studied law at the London School of Economics and then worked in trust litigation for 17 years, a career she describes as “professionally but not personally fulfilling”.She also brought up five children: “It’s a bit Brady Bunch,” she laughs, as she had two kids and then married a widowed father of three so despite always knowing that she wanted to write, she couldn’t find the time.About 10 years ago she gave up law to concentrate on being a stay-at-home mother. “Having it all is a mantra the modern woman is sold, supposedly to make us feel better, but it can make you feel like a failure when you don’t have that balance, when you’re feeling burnt out and short-changed.”It was only when her youngest started secondary school that she felt able to finally start writing.“The way I look at it now is that you can have it all, but only if you do one thing at a time.”She enrolled in a creative writing MA. Her work in progress was shortlisted for the 2016 Lucy Cavendish prize, and she found an agent before she’d finished the course. On the evening before the novel was planned to go to a nine-way auction, Viking made an offer too good to refuse. The book’s also been optioned for TV – Collins is currently working on the adaptation. Not that the writing process was easy: “Nothing I have ever done, including raising five children, was harder than writing this novel.”From Charlotte Brontë through Sarah Waters (at the novel’s heart is a love story between Frannie and her white mistress), Alias Grace and Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, The Confessions of Frannie Langton draws on a wealth of literary influences, although Collins admits that she’s always found Rhys’s novel “problematic because it privileges the white Creole experience at the expense of women like Frannie”.As a black woman she feels pressure to “write about race in an emotionally honest way”, which is why she wanted Frannie to “challenge the idea of pure victimhood”. What is her response to those who question the authenticity of such bold historical revisionism?“Because of the dominance of stuffy male academics, we’re not used to hearing these voices, so when they’re fictionalised it comes as a shock and we might think of it as anachronistic,” she says. “But I think all we’re doing with historical fiction is imagining what people might have said if they’d been able to speak for themselves.” Lucy ScholesBev Thomas never expected to set her first novel in the world of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Having worked for many years as a clinical psychologist in the NHS, her first attempts at writing included forays into historical fiction. But eventually she found herself writing a novel set in her professional domain. “I’ve always been interested in what people do and why they do things,” Thomas says. “That’s why I trained as a clinical psychologist. When I began writing it was fundamental for me to think that the characters made psychological sense. It’s a psychological drama rather than a thriller.”A Good Enough Mother is about grief, motherhood and the complexities of the therapist-patient relationship. The novel’s narrator is Dr Ruth Hartland, a highly respected psychotherapist and director of a trauma unit whose private life is unravelling: her teenage son has gone missing, her marriage has fallen apart and her relationship with her daughter is strained. When a patient resembling her missing son arrives at the unit, the boundaries between Ruth’s professional judgment and her personal trauma begin to blur, with devastating consequences.Part of Thomas’s motivation was, she says, to humanise therapists: “The reality is that therapists have crumbling lives like everybody else: marriages that don’t work, children they can’t manage very well… They are not perfect people but that doesn’t stop them being fantastic therapists.”The novel is immersed in the world of therapy: there are discussions about transference and counter-transference, and references to Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott, who first introduced the idea of “the good-enough mother”.“You’re opening a door on to an intimate world,” Thomas says. “My aim is that people who are not necessarily ever going to have therapy might find the concepts useful outside the therapy room: that it might change the way they work with a colleague, or how they understand what their child might be feeling.”Integral to Ruth’s narrative is the experience of loss, which, as Thomas observes, is universal. “It’s something that finds its way into the therapy room in all sorts of guises. I don’t just mean bereavement, but loss of identity or loss of a family member through drugs or alcohol or mental health issues. Loss is such a human condition.”These universal themes led to A Good Enough Mother being the subject of a five-way publisher auction. But Thomas’s route to publication has involved “18 years of hard graft”. She has, she says, become “an Arvon junkie”, attending multiple creative writing courses. She likes the collective work done in creative writing groups. “Getting that feedback has definitely altered things I’ve written. If you feel supported and contained then I think you can do your best work.” Writing groups mirror her current role as an organisational consultant, helping mental health teams collaborate and communicate more effectively. “I do love groups. I think it’s fascinating how group processes get played out in organisations.”Thomas now plans to combine writing with her clinical work. “For me, the leap from therapy to writing wasn’t quite such a leap as it might seem,” she says. “Part of what therapists do is help people tell their life stories. And you write in order to engage and have some kind of connection. So to now have this opportunity to connect with readers through a psychological book is fantastic.” Hannah BeckermanIsabella Hammad, 27, was a teenager when she first felt a “real impulse” to be a writer. “It was Virginia Woolf that made me feel the need to express myself in that way,” she says, but she also had a tale she was itching to tell. ‘‘It was a particular story that I wanted to get out, about my great grandfather Midhat in Palestine. I had heard all these stories about him and I remember the exact moment – in the back of the car, listening to my father talking about him – when I thought ‘This would make a great novel.’”The Parisian is a hugely accomplished historical sweep of a book describing the life and times of young Palestinian dreamer, Midhat Kamal. It encompasses his childhood in Nablus, Palestine, student days in Montpellier, the turbulent years of the first world war and the Palestinian struggle for independence.Hammad is careful to say that while the central character has the same name as her great-grandfather, the book is heavily fictionalised, that she has “joined the dots imaginatively”. The result is a novel of immense skill and confidence, garnering praise from Zadie Smith, who taught her for a while, and who calls it “a sublime reading experience… surpassingly intelligent”.Hammad studied at Oxford University then Harvard, and last year won the Paris Review’s Plimpton prize for fiction with a short story called Mr Can’aan. She grew up in west London with her parents and brother and navigates her heritage with care, commenting that she finds talking about her father “tricky” when I ask about him and their relationship with his homeland.A theme in the book, she says, is the pressure Palestinians feel to somehow speak for their whole country. “This is a struggle many Palestinians face: they don’t want to be defined in this way, to have to be representative. There is no single Palestinian experience. The life of a Palestinian living in Nablus is very different from a Palestinian living in Gaza or Jerusalem. Different from living in Jaffa, Syria or Lebanon. I mean, I’m obviously a mix, but I’m more complex than that, and I don’t think I can be representative in any way.”Before writing the book Hammad spent about a year in the Middle East, researching – which, she says, was its own adventure. “I interviewed about 80 members of my family, but also I spent a lot of time with historians, geographers and refugees.”Does she feel a little responsibility, having written a book based on the life of a relative who has the same name as the central character? (Her father has read and enjoyed the book.) “Yes, in a way,” she says. “But the act of writing often feels irresponsible because you’re in imagination, a dream zone.”Her home is now in Brooklyn, New York, where she has begun work on her next novel, also set in Palestine – “but contemporary and shorter!” – which she has just visited again to do more research. “For the time being it’s my obsession.”Given the praise The Parisian is already receiving, does she feel the weight of expectation?“I’m not really thinking about it,” she says. “I think it really helps to have started writing something new. It means that’s where my lifeblood is now. I did the work, I did the book. What happens happens.” Ursula KennyRosie Price had set her sights on being a writer several years before she started work on What Red Was. “But it wasn’t until I started writing about sexual assault that the work took off. It felt so urgent – there was so much I needed to say, and that gave me the momentum to keep going.”Price, 26, was herself the victim of rape, when she was “too young to understand properly”. Through writing the book, she began to make sense of her own experiences, exploring how the assault had “changed my view of the world”.The novel is an intriguing blend: part comedy of manners, part hard-hitting drama. Price was influenced, she says, by Edward St Aubyn’s blackly comic Patrick Melrose novels, and the idea that “the more levity and joyful moments you have, the darker you are able to go”.It follows a young woman, Kate Quaile, as she leaves her modest upbringing in rural Gloucestershire for university. There she meets Max Rippon, a charismatic young man from a privileged background. Kate is drawn into Max’s world, and becomes close to his mother, Zara, a successful film director. She becomes increasingly reliant on the Rippons, both emotionally and financially, so when she is assaulted by one of their inner circle, she finds herself trapped.When Price started writing the novel she was working in a literary agency – a job she had held since graduating three years earlier. She initially worked on the book in the evenings and at weekends, but then quickly realised that she needed to “make the leap and commit”. She left her job for a more flexible tutoring role, which allowed her to write in the mornings. The gamble paid off: there was a five-way auction among publishers for What Red Was, and film rights have now been bought by the BBC.Of course the book feels timely in the light of the #MeToo movement – but the project was already well under way when the first Weinstein allegations surfaced in October 2017. Some of the echoes in Price’s narrative seem almost uncanny. “When it all emerged, I already had a character who was a female film director, who had been assaulted,” she says.Although she praises #MeToo as “an incredible movement”, she describes that period as a difficult one for people who have been victims of rape and assault. “It is really hard to be reminded of it every time you turn on the news. And in some ways it felt as though those experiences were being normalised.”What Red Was has allowed Price not only to explore her own legacy of trauma, but also to find a way of speaking out – the pros and cons of which are explored in the book.“Nobody can tell a rape survivor how to behave – there are a plethora of reasons why speaking out may not be the right thing to do,” she says. “The one thing you have afterwards is control over how you tell your story. For me, the process of writing has been very empowering.” Alice O’KeeffeIt was moving house that gave Beth O’Leary, 26, the idea for her first novel. She had been living in London for a couple of years after graduating from Oxford University, working in children’s publishing, but never felt “quite right” in the city. “It’s so loud and nonstop and just not me,” she says. So she moved back to Winchester, her home town, to share a flat with her boyfriend, Sam, a junior doctor.She found ways of telling how Sam’s day had been. “I would start to notice how many coffee mugs were by the sink. If his trainers were out, that meant he’d had time to go for a run before he went to bed. And it just got me thinking, ‘What an interesting thing that is, how close you can feel to someone when you’re in the same physical space but not at the same time. Could two people who don’t know each other become very close living like this?’”That is the big question driving O’Leary’s story about two hard-pressed strangers who decide to save money by sharing a one-bedroom flat. Leon works nights as a nurse, so he occupies the flat during the day, while Tiffy is out at work as a publicist. She has the place to herself the rest of the time. The book, which O’Leary wrote on her laptop during her daily commute, explores Leon and Tiffy’s relationship and their lives as they communicate through Post-It notes, introducing us to an eclectic cast of minor characters, from Leon’s brother, who is in prison, to Tiffy’s controlling ex-partner.Having rented a flat in London herself, where a sewage pipe from the flat above used to leak through her bedroom wall, O’Leary says: “It didn’t seem at all implausible to me that two people would agree to that kind of arrangement, because so many people I knew were so desperate to find somewhere to live in London, however awful.”Within weeks of her sending the book to an agent it had sold in a pre-emptive deal for six figures, with foreign rights snapped up in 30 countries.O’Leary has always wanted to be a writer. Growing up as one of six children in a noisy household, she spent every spare moment reading books and writing stories. “I just never thought it was really a feasible career path,” she says. Now she has given up her job in publishing to write fulltime. “It is a total dream,” she says. Lisa O’KellyYara Rodrigues Fowler’s debut is unlike any other book you’ve read. A blend of prose and poetry, it’s a collection of short pieces that gradually cohere into a larger narrative. But while it’s formally experimental, it never feels like a chore. Holding the disparate elements together is a strong sense of identity and voice – the development of which is, in fact, partly what Stubborn Archivist is about.Rodrigues Fowler, 26, is a south Londoner, the child of an English father and a Brazilian mother. The book draws on her experience of growing up between those cultures. “I would love it if the book helped to make the Latin American population of the UK more visible,” she says. “It’s such a heterogeneous community – racially and in terms of class.”The Latin American diaspora forms one of the UK’s fastest-growing communities, but is not well represented in British literature – unlike in the US, where there is a strong canon of Latin American authors writing in English (Junot Díaz, Daniel Alarcón, Edwidge Danticat). On this side of the Atlantic, the multicultural experience has been explored mainly by writers with family links to former British colonies.“I grew up reading Zadie Smith, Hanif Kureishi and Salman Rushdie, so they were big influences,” says Rodrigues Fowler, but she also cites Danticat, Alice Walker, and the Brazilian oral storytelling tradition. “I grew up listening to musicians like Elis Regina and Caetano Veloso, and I wanted to give the book an oral poetic texture.”Another important thread in Stubborn Archivist is that of sexual violence, and how that can be fed by racial prejudice. The protagonist, who is never named, has a British boyfriend with a taste for Brazilian porn. He asks her to grow her hair so she looks more like Penélope Cruz, and talk in Portuguese in bed. Although the violence is never made explicit, it is clear that these fantasies are the beginning of a process of dehumanisation that leads them to a dark place.“I wanted to look at how her Brazilian identity is part and parcel of her experience of sexual assault,” says Rodrigues Fowler, who is the trustee of a refuge for Latin American women. She hopes that people who have experienced sexual violence will read the book and identify with “how you exist in the world after that happens. And recognise that you can be in love with the person who is violent towards you.”Flitting nimbly through generations, between Brazil and south London, between dating and dictatorship, this is a novel that is personal and political – and its unusual form is integral to its power. Rodrigues Fowler says she wanted to “use blank space as a way of expressing trauma – both the trauma of dictatorship and sexual violence”.

A growing chorus of global leaders spent 2018 warning that the leveraged loan mountain was getting dangerously large and inviting comparisons with the financial crisis a decade ago.The Bank of England, Australia’s central bank, the International Monetary Fund and members of the US Federal Reserve have raised red flags over so-called leveraged loans, which are offered to companies already in debt but often come with few strings attached.In October last year the Bank’s financial policy committee, which monitors the health of the financial system, pointedly raised the spectre of the 2007-08 credit crunch. It said the “global leveraged loan market was larger than – and was growing as quickly as – the US sub-prime mortgage market had been in 2006”.As with the sub-prime crisis, the bank added, underwriting standards had slipped – in other words, risky corporate debt was too easy to get right now. “Given the decline in underwriting standards, investors in leveraged loans are at increasing risk of loss,” said the Bank.The key question now is whether a bubble in a different corner of the debt market could trigger a market panic. “A quote wrongly attributed to Mark Twain fits here: history rarely repeats, but it does rhyme,” said Rasheed Saleuddin, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School.While he said it was hard to see the next financial crash coming directly from a failure in the leveraged loan market, Saleuddin added that there was a chance that “small changes in default rates in the loans or even in expectations of same could cause a meltdown”.In the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, banks were so keen to lend that they liberally handed out mortgages to customers with weak or no credit histories who ended up defaulting when times got tough. Those mortgages had been bundled together and turned into investable products, causing a chain reaction of losses that spread like wildfire throughout the financial system and caused a global downturn.A decade later, rather than doling out risky loans to homeowners, banks are handing out leveraged loans to indebted companies. Many are also “covenant-lite”, meaning they come with fewer strings attached for borrowers, and as a result, present greater risk for lenders.But since most loans are sold on and packaged as collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, there are fewer incentives to impose strict terms. Leveraged loans also come with floating rates, making them more attractive for investors, who receive higher interest payments when rates rise.Amir Amel-Zadeh, an associate professor at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, explained that investors in leveraged loans, loan mutual funds and CLOs could face higher losses than investors in the same products during the 2008 crisis due to lower lending standards, an increase in covenant-lite loans and higher levels of corporate indebtedness than 10 years ago.But while the trends in the CLO market were similar, he said the scale was nowhere near the mortgage securitisation market in 2008 – at about a tenth of the size. “So at first sight it is not as worrying from a systemic risk point of view. However, if economic conditions worsen, it can lead to losses for many investors and lead to a similar dry-up in liquidity in these instruments as we have witnessed with sub-prime mortgage securitisations during the 2008 crisis.”Reports have already emerged that the market for CLOs may be cooling, as uncertainty grips financial markets. With fewer investors lining up to take a slice of the leveraged loan market, prices have dropped, and banks have been postponing sales of leveraged loans to investors as a result. “If banks have to keep the loans on their books they will be exposed to the price risk,” Amel-Zadeh said.Without a hungry market to sell leveraged loans to, banks may be less willing to lend so liberally to indebted companies. And without further loans to feed their debt habits, companies could be at risk of default. This particular debt market will be one to watch in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0298cec4bd686b4347e4a31cfa33d8a8a1cd8f8d/0_163_3834_2300/master/3834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8b234001145e99d575884d1946632e","title":"is it time to trim the uk treasury","story":"Harold Wilson was right: we need a separate department for the economy to boost growthThe Treasury is the most powerful institution in Whitehall. It is actually a super-ministry combining functions separated in many other countries: management of the economy and control of the public finances.These two functions are not accorded equal weight and never have been. The Treasury has always been primarily a finance ministry that views its main task as ensuring the nation’s budget arithmetic adds up.Down the ages, the Treasury has argued there is nothing incompatible about its two objectives. Running a tight ship helps growth, it is said, because it leads to the financial markets having more confidence in the government. If the City is relaxed about the public finances it charges lower interest rates on the money it lends to the state. Lower interest rates lead to higher growth.Conversely, trying to stimulate the economy through higher budget deficits doesn’t work because the extra public borrowing leads to a loss of confidence in the markets, higher interest rates and lower growth. In the jargon of the trade, public borrowing crowds out private investment.This doctrine has been challenged down the years. Keynes railed against the so-called “Treasury view” when he was making the case for higher public investment to tackle high unemployment in the late 1920s and early 1930s.Thirty or so years later Harold Wilson’s 1964 Labour government thought the way to raise Britain’s growth rate was to set up a bespoke ministry – the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) – completely separate from the Treasury and run by a heavy-hitting cabinet minister, George Brown.Yet Wilson in effect neutered the DEA by ruling out a devaluation of the pound. An overvalued exchange rate meant the Labour government had no chance of hitting its ambitious growth targets. Financial stability was accorded a higher priority than the real economy. The Whitehall turf war between the Treasury and the DEA became a no-contest.Tony Blair’s government tried a different solution. Under Gordon Brown, the Treasury sucked in functions from other departments and became a ministry for everything: welfare, regional policy, productivity, overseas aid and jobs.But since Labour fell from power in 2010, the Treasury has reverted to a more traditional approach. The size of the budget deficit that resulted from the financial crisis alarmed not just the incoming chancellor, George Osborne, but his senior mandarins as well. The overriding aim of Treasury policy from May 2010 onwards was to cut spending to get the deficit down. It was left to the Bank of England to stimulate growth through ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Vince Cable, when he was business secretary in the 2010-15 coalition government, had plenty of interesting ideas for reviving manufacturing but was forced to live off the scraps from Osborne’s table.The economy has not changed fundamentally in the past decade. Consumer spending is the mainstay of growth manufacturing is weak the trade deficit troublingly wide. These are age-old problems that werethere before Britain joined the European Economic Community have remained unsolved in the years since, and will remain to be tackled whatever the Brexit outcome.The EU referendum led to some soul-searching in government. Why had people in the old industrial areas voted to leave the EU in such numbers? Why was the economy so unbalanced between north and south? Why were so many of the jobs being created low skilled and low paid?These were the right questions. But while the EU referendum made it easier to identify the problems, it also made it harder to start finding the solutions because so much of the government’s focus for the past two and a half years has been on Brexit rather than on what needs to be done to make a success of its industrial strategy.That inevitably brings us back to the power of the Treasury to stop things happening. Labour’s answer to Whitehall’s imbalance of power is to give the Bank of England a productivity target to sit alongside its inflation target. But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has yet to make clear how Threadneedle Street could do this, given the limited policy tools at its disposal.An alternative would be to give responsibility for the industrial strategy and supply-side reform to a new properly funded department for the economy. That would, of course, be resisted by the Treasury, and wouldn’t be enough on its own. But put the most senior member of the government in to run the new department and announce that the way to get the public finances right was to get the economy right rather than vice versa and there might be real change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9553f43ab9c28032cf6f2e98ff23796aada3ce35/0_183_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37d11289121b61cd5b269004cd0529ba","title":"potential hmv buyers given until tuesday to make an offer","story":"Several approaches to stricken entertainment retailer believed to have been made alreadyThe future of the troubled HMV retail chain will be decided this week, with companies hoping to buy the long-established music retailer, which employs 2,200 people, set a deadline of Tuesday to submit bids.HMV became one of the first casualties of the worst Christmas for 10 years on the UK high street late last month, when it called in administrators from accountancy firm KPMG to help it either find a buyer or wind up the company.HMV – which accounts for nearly a third of all physical music sales in Britain as well as nearly a quarter of DVD sales – said retailers across the country had faced “a tsunami of challenges”, with “extremely weak” festive trading.

We all go to great lengths to conceal our own, producing improbable lines in job interviews about our greatest weakness being our tendency to work too hard. Politicians employ advisers who plot news grids to show how busy and effective their leaders are, even as those leaders regularly fail to take important decisions.Shakespeare liked to use two devices to get his characters to reveal their true selves: he either put them in disguise or got them drunk. In politics today, the device for unmasking people’s weaknesses is rather less fun than a masked ball or session with a tankard: it’s Brexit.It was inevitable that the aftermath of the EU referendum would put a kind of pressure on politicians that would make it very difficult for even the strongest to conceal their imperfections. Theresa May is the most obvious victim of this extraordinary pressure. She claimed when trying to become Tory leader that she was someone who believed in getting things done, rather than gossiping in the bars of Westminster. Yet her approach to Brexit has largely been characterised by procrastination at a level that manages to make David Cameron, nicknamed the “essay crisis prime minister”, look like a model student.Initially, May believed the meaningful vote would succeed in December – and was told by her chief whip Julian Smith that it would, too. Smith made clear “this is a deal we can sell to MPs”, before racing back to the prime minister a little later to report that MPs were not buying it after all.Cabinet ministers now report May’s latest procrastination involves refusing to discuss what her plan B might look like. She will only have three days before she must set that out in parliament if she is defeated on Tuesday, but one secretary of state remarks that “if she’s got any sort of plan, she’s keeping it to herself”. Backbench MPs report that the whips now seem more interested in how they can get their support for the next vote.The whips are courting Labour MPs, too, and they may find a few more from the opposition benches are driven their way by Jeremy Corbyn’s comments on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, in which he admitted he would rather get a negotiated Brexit deal than have a second referendum. It is pretty easy to see how the pressure of Brexit has caused serious cracks in the Labour party, and not just when it comes to those moderates who have always disliked the leader.But what has been less immediately discernible is the way in which Brexit has shown up parliament. Both sides in the debate now use the infamous “take back control” phrase as the justification for what they are up to, with remainer MPs insisting the plots and amendments – and indeed what they see as the support of the Speaker, John Bercow – represent the house taking back control. It is also striking how many pro-leave MPs are privately upset about the way Commons procedure is being abused, not just by the speaker, but also by the government. One remarks that the way ministers and MPs are ignoring the very rules designed to check the power of the executive is a terrible example to emerging democracies around the world.At a granular level, MPs often don’t understand the domestic legislation they are voting on, let alone the new policy areas that are going to come under parliament’s authority after Brexit. One Tory MP recently told their whip they were minded to vote against the deal because their constituents didn’t understand it. They seemed to have forgotten that their constituents had elected and were now paying, via their taxes, for this MP to understand the deal on their behalf.Mind you, it’s not entirely fair to blame MPs for this mess. Political discourse more generally has broken down, to the extent that parliamentarians are now asking not to have to leave the parliamentary estate to conduct TV interviews, lest they be pursued and harassed by angry protesters. Those who claim the mobs on College Green are nothing new and just something tough politicians should be able to put up with seem to forget that harassment isn’t something anyone deserves, no matter what a fool they prove themselves to be in the Commons chamber.They also seem strangely willing to forgive those who are at the extreme end of a wider problem in British society, which is that we have forgotten how to disagree. There are the silly examples, which largely emerge from universities, but then there are the splits within families, between the generations and across the countries and regions of the UK. Some remainers recently hailed a map of areas that had opposed Brexit as a “lovely archipelago”, presumably because they felt they could relax only when they didn’t have to encounter those who were different to them. These tensions were bubbling long before Brexit, but like a strong drink for Shakespeare’s Cassio the referendum forced the anger into the open.We are reaching the point in January where people start abandoning their new year’s resolutions to get fit, realising it is just too much hard work. Yet so few of the political class seem prepared to admit that their greatest unfitness at the moment concerns their inability to deal with the challenge of Brexit, presumably because to do so would be to admit to weaknesses they have long tried to ignore.• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42bd81030b9a602d66676d5ad5053ffa60f13ac/0_320_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d13cde9d233757c50dab67809eae6f56","title":"the guardian view on social housing we need a cultural shift","story":"Nineteen months after the Grenfell Tower fire, some of the hunger for change catalysed by the terrible events of 14 June 2017 has found an outlet. A report by the commission on social housing convened by the charity Shelter takes up a number of proposals put forward by the disaster’s survivors. The signs are that the government is listening. Proposals for a new system of regulation in England are expected later this year.The commission makes the case for a model based on reforms to the banking sector, a key element of which is that consumers – tenants, in this case – should have their own regulator, distinct from the body tasked with economic oversight. The new organisation, the report argues, should proactively inspect private as well as social landlords, and set clear standards. Barriers to complaint must be removed, no-fault evictions outlawed, and tenancies extended beyond the three years now being considered – as they have been in Scotland. The proposal for a national, independent tenants’ organisation, and enhanced powers for local groups, is also sound. Currently, half of private renters who make complaints are evicted within six months. This is not to tar all housing providers with the same brush. Many are responsive and responsible. But whatever the detailed findings of Sir Martin Moore-Bick’s inquiry into Grenfell, it is clear that the balance of power between tenants and landlords is wrong. The commission’s point that many tenants are locked in, and cannot “switch supplier”, as consumers are encouraged to do when dissatisfied with a utility company, is well made. It is this sense of helplessness that breeds the stigma acknowledged by Theresa May last year, and described by the commission as linked to the “institutional indifference” it seeks to end.Falling rates of ownership and the ballooning housing benefit bill, as well as Grenfell, mean the terms of the housing debate have changed. Among Shelter’s commissioners were former Conservative ministers Lord Jim O’Neill and Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who announced at the report’s launch that she has changed her mind. Having previously believed that the market could deliver her party’s vision of a property-owning democracy, she now endorses a vast expansion of public housing.The recommendation that 3.1m homes should be built in England in the next two decades would see the largest-ever growth of socially rented accommodation. This would provide for all those failed by the market, including 691,000 older people as well as priced-out younger renters, and the 1.27m households “in greatest need”. The commission suggests its 20-year programme would cost an average of £10.7bn a year (reduced to £3.8bn if benefits and taxes are considered).The proposals for a new regulator and union for tenants should be adopted. The principle that people who will never own their own homes should be entitled to a socially rented one is also correct. If the Treasury, under this or any future government, declines to fund the necessary increase, ministers must do all they can to encourage pension funds and other investors to step forward. The provision of high-quality housing to the toughest environmental standards, in mixed communities, is in the national interest, unlike the speculation and rent-seeking that characterise our dysfunctional housing market. If we can one day look back and see that Grenfell led to a cultural shift in the way housing is regarded, and an improvement in the position of tenants, the disaster’s 72 victims will not have died for nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14240f605a0d3b784d232e731ffd7cba0f341a9e/0_105_2126_1275/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75f1f5ebcc6028159f47caec37cd644e","title":"why ive got the needle over the rise of botox parties","story":"Apparently, they are all the rage among lesbians in New York. I don’t want Botox, but I would have liked an inviteA friend recently mentioned someone she had met at a lesbian Botox party. “A what?” I asked. “A Botox party,” she repeated. “Don’t you know about Botox parties?” While her face was expressionless, her voice was incredulous. “Seriously, how have you never heard of this?”After some frantic Googling, I had no idea how I had never heard of Botox parties. Apparently, it has become all the rage to get a group of friends together at someone’s house for wine, nibbles and cosmetic injections of botulinum toxin from a medical professional. Everyone pays a set amount to attend and it is cheaper and more comfortable than going to a doctor. Because the effect of Botox wears off after a few months, these parties are regular social events. “It’s a good way to catch up with people,” my friend said. The party she goes to is all gay women and invite-only.These gatherings aren’t just favoured by middle-aged lesbians. Botox’s popularity in the US, particularly among young people, has rocketed since it was approved there for cosmetic use in 2002. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has noted a dramatic increase in patients under 30 getting “preventative” Botox in recent years. This has been fuelled, in part, by Instagram culture. And Botox parties have been mainstreamed by reality TV shows such as Real Housewives.The rise of Botox parties is troubling for several reasons. It’s troubling that so many of us have an issue with ageing naturally. It’s troubling that people are drinking and driving needles into their face. It’s also troubling that I have never been to one of these parties when, apparently every other gay in New York has. Not that I want Botox – I am just upset I haven’t been invited. But it’s OK. I’m keeping a stiff upper lip about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b3d805d145d718dd2f963967fd5c3ec8a1dddd/0_170_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1297a71e0f07cf56160daa99033a1ab4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of contrast","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘contrast’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘contrast’.Share your photos of what contrast means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 January at 10am.

But changes to funding and the removal of institutional limits on undergraduate recruitment have shifted admissions towards the interest of applicants.UCU’s efforts to reopen the discussion were backed by Gordon Marsden, Labour’s shadow higher education minister.“An urgent debate needs to be had on post-qualification admissions. This government has failed to take meaningful action to improve access, and the current university admissions system too often makes it impossible for disadvantaged pupils to reach their full potential,” Marsden said.“From unreliable predicted grades that can underestimate the ability of disadvantaged students, to the skyrocketing number of unconditional offers, the current system is in need of a serious rethink if it is to give every student the chance to succeed.”Currently, sixth-formers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for places on courses by January, months before sitting their exams in early summer. The timing forces applicants and universities to base their decisions on teachers’ predictions of likely grades – despite evidence showing those predictions to be largely inaccurate.By bringing forward the sitting of A-levels and similar qualifications to after Easter, and pushing back the start of term for first-year undergraduates, the authors are confident that the bulk of applications and acceptances could take place in August.The report says that the time between the end of exams and results being published at the start of August should be used to provide high-quality advice to school-leavers on their career options and potential courses.“A higher-education system should be more than a cycle. It should be a set of support structures that enables students to make decisions about their higher-education courses and institutions,” the report, by Nartey and Graeme Atherton of the National Education Opportunities Network, states.Bill Rammell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and a former higher education minister under Labour, said he strongly supported post-qualification admissions, but thought the report’s proposed term-date changes – with first-year students starting their courses a few weeks after other students – would be unpopular.“We are slowly moving towards post-qualification admissions in any case, because students are now in the driving seats,” said Rammell.Nartey said students would be empowered by knowing their results at the point they applied, and that universities would be able to more easily and quickly select their future undergraduates.A shift to post-qualification applications would also end the process known as clearing, a hurried scramble for remaining places among students who failed to achieve the grades predicted by their teachers, which takes places immediately after exam results are published in mid-August.The change would also kill off the increasing use of unconditional offers by some institutions, which award places to students regardless of their eventual grades. Unconditional offers have been strongly criticised by head teachers as causing disruption in schools and removing incentives for pupils to perform to their best ability.Nartey also said that previous research published by UCU had found that some under-represented groups, including ethnic minorities, were disadvantaged by the existing system, because their predicted A-levels may not have matched their true abilities.“Students aren’t able to be broad or bold in their applications, because they didn’t know what they may have achieved,” Nartey said.A spokesperson for Universities UK – which represents the bulk of British universities – said in response to the report: “One reason universities decided not adopt a new model was because disadvantaged students would not have access to one of their best sources of information for advice on university applications, their school or college, in the time they need to make a decision.“We recognise that there are still challenges to address, including improving information for students and accuracy of predicted grades, and we will be reviewing new information on this topic from Ucas with interest when it is published.”A 2011 study by Ucas found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds were likely to lose out under the current system, because they had less advice and support.Earlier research by UCU showed that the existing application system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is a global outlier compared to other high-performing countries, and the only one to use predicted grades as the basis for admissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aac56d9b372b6eb1fb859b57ab9100f90bfeec7/229_384_4550_2731/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c7ca93b5150e65ec234fc287d9c34e","title":"manchester united women game abandoned","story":"Manchester United Women’s Championship game against Charlton was abandoned on Sunday following a serious injury to the Addicks defender Charlotte Kerr.Kerr was injured in a collision, thought to have been with her own goalkeeper, after United had taken the lead through Charlie Devlin in the 11th minute.An ambulance was called to Oakwood, in south-east London, but it did not arrive for around 30 minutes, during which time the defender received lengthy treatment on the pitch from both sets of medical staff.It is believed the game was abandoned after all the emergency oxygen had been used, it being a requirement to have a supply on site during a game.FA WSL and Women’s Championship Competition Rules state: “Clubs shall ensure that emergency sports first aid equipment is present and in full working order at each Competition Match.

Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham lost but it is not curtains for the Argentinian’s candidacy. He will remain of great interest to the power-brokers at Old Trafford.What the result did do was swell the feelgood factor at United that has built under the caretaker management of Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Remarkably he has now won each of his first six matches in charge – no United manager has ever done that – and this was a big one in what was the first acid test of his tenure.Spurs have established themselves as a Premier League force under Pochettino and they threw everything at United in a fine second-half performance. Unfortunately for them they ran into a goalkeeper in inspired form.David de Gea made a succession of saves and blocks with his feet in that unshowy manner of his to merit the man-of-the-match award. He could not have been expected to make some of them. It added up to a fourth league defeat of the season for Spurs at Wembley and it came coated in misfortune, with the added blows of injuries to Harry Kane and Moussa Sissoko.The former limped off at the very end after twisting his ankle under a challenge from Phil Jones, and Spurs will hold their breath on the results of scans. Kane has a history of ankle problems and it is certainly bad timing, with Son Heung-min now departing for the Asia Cup.Most pleasing from United’s point of view was how Solskjær’s team came to play and attack. He sprang a tactical surprise by starting Jesse Lingard, rather than Romelu Lukaku, as the central striker, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial either side of him and the trio gave United a pacy and energetic feel.United’s visits to top-six opposition under Mourinho had, with only a couple of exceptions, been grisly wars of attrition. They did not just park the bus but throw the keys into the stand and the statistics showed only two wins from 13 matches – and 11 goals scored.It was a different story here and United deserved their half-time lead, which came on 44 minutes when Lingard, perfectly positioned by Solskjær, intercepted a loose pass from Kieran Trippier. He found Paul Pogba who, in keeping with Solskjær’s philosophy, got United moving quickly. It was his sumptuous crossfield ball that released Rashford in the inside right channel and offered the latest evidence of the freedom with which the Frenchman is playing under the Norwegian.Rashford got himself up against Jan Vertonghen, who was back after two months out with a hamstring injury, and the Spurs defender never looked like stopping the United forward, whose first touch was assured. The angle was tight but the low finish was arrowed into the far corner via Hugo Lloris’s fingertips.It was always going to be interesting to gauge Spurs’ intensity levels after Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea, when they looked jaded. United by contrast were fresh from a warm-weather training break in Dubai. Sissoko lasted only 42 minutes before succumbing to a groin problem, and it was while Spurs tried to reorganise that Rashford scored.Spurs created a few moments of danger in the first half, mainly through Kane, but it was the visitors who looked the slicker and more threatening before the interval. They could look back on a chance for Lingard, which he snatched at and lifted over, and low shots on the break from Rashford and Martial, both of which Lloris kept out.Spurs dug deep in the second half to show their character and quality. Sissoko’s replacement, Érik Lamela, injected bite and penetration, Trippier repeatedly got into crossing positions on the right and Dele Alli and Kane shimmered with menace. They hinted at an equaliser extensively but it would not come.Some of Spurs’ chances were gilt-edged, beginning with Kane’s on 48 minutes, forged by Alli’s through-ball. Kane shot straight at De Gea. The United goalkeeper did well to keep out an Alli header while another from Kane was more comfortable. He was just getting started.De Gea’s one-on-one block from Alli in the 66th minute took away the breath and so did the save he made with his left foot to keep out Toby Alderweireld’s near-post flick from a corner. There was also a flying catch from a Kane free-kick and further excellent saves to deny Alli and Kane. De Gea refused to be beaten.United had their chances at the other end. Pogba saw a header and a low shot both saved by Lloris and there was another moment when he chased his own blocked shot, brushed aside Christian Eriksen and tried to lob the Spurs goalkeeper, who made a wonderful reaction save.This was good Pogba, fusing muscle with deft touch to lift things to a higher plane – almost bullying the opposition – but there was a flash of bad Pogba on 78 minutes when he left a nasty boot in on Alli, for which he was booked. He diced with further trouble by hurling the ball away immediately after the foul.It was thrillingly open, the sort of game United fans used to see on a regular basis. Thanks in large part to De Gea, they could also bask in the result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa76df22c8f5ee6c62206e85e95ce681b3e1f3e/0_146_1332_799/master/1332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca02a3429f934c4bcb321136052868b","title":"unai emery arsenal mesut ozil","story":"• Manager says German international ‘is like another player’• Comments come after he omitted player for defeat at West HamUnai Emery made it clear that Mesut Özil’s days as one of Arsenal’s stars are in the past after dropping the midfielder for the 1-0 defeat by West Ham United.Özil’s absence from yet another difficult away game raised some awkward questions for Emery after his side’s toothless display at the London Stadium left them six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Two days after admitting he has funds to make only loan signings this month, it was strange that Arsenal’s manager found no place in his squad for a player with two and a half years left on a contract worth £350,000 a week.Emery was asked if it represented a luxury to leave out his highest earner on tactical grounds, especially as his bench contained few attacking options. Yet his response only served to underline how far the German has fallen down the pecking order since Arsène Wenger’s departure at the end of last season.“For me he is like another player,” Emery said. “It’s one decision, when one player is coming or not coming. Sometimes he is helping us, at other moments he is not helping us because of his injury or because maybe the match is not for him. But he is a good player.”Özil, who has not played since being withdrawn at half-time in the 1-1 draw with Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion on Boxing Day, returned to training last week after shaking off a knee injury. Yet it has become clear that Emery does not trust him to work hard enough away from home. Özil tweeted a picture of himself in training on Friday afternoon, the same day he was told of his omission against West Ham. “Like the other players,” Emery said. “When we did the squad.”Arsenal, who host Chelsea on Saturday evening, have picked up two points from their last five away games. “It’s our challenge,” Emery said. “Each match is our challenge away. We are working on that.“We need to take more confidence, more performance collectively, being competitive away to change this moment. We started the season away well, being competitive and winning. But we need to do more to be more competitive and to impose our idea and our quality.”West Ham, meanwhile, are in talks to sell the midfielder Pedro Obiang to Fiorentina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c64f9e668f63126acce32d1c1b65bfb2f9e223/0_3059_6055_3632/master/6055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b23d026d786dbe371b4f64084bf134b","title":"top gear here i come passing my driving test at 38","story":"After finally getting his driver’s licence, Stuart Heritage wonders whether he’s now a real grownupHere’s something I learned the hard way: if you’re taking driving lessons as an adult, it’s generally a good idea not to mention it in public.

No. No, it hasn’t.But at least now I can shut them up. Because last month, at the grand age of 38, I finally passed my driving test.

Because I first took driving lessons as a teenager, and it’s fair to say the whole thing went horribly. Back then I took test after test after test some where I racked up an impossible number of minors, some where I kept indicating the wrong way, one where the examiner had to physically lean over and wrench the steering wheel from my hands to stop me from hitting a parked car. It got so desperate that, at the café where I worked, a middle-aged waitress once gave me a Temazepam to take before my next test to calm me down. I didn’t take it, but nevertheless it was a solid sign that things had got undeniably bad.However, I’m also treating the fact that I have now passed as a solid sign that people are capable of change. Twenty years ago, I cannot remember a time spent behind the wheel – either in lessons or on tests – where I wasn’t utterly paralysed with fear. To me, cars were the things I’d spent my entire childhood learning to avoid. They were heavy, speeding, exploding missiles of metal and glass that the Green Cross Code Man made perfectly clear would definitely kill you if they had the chance. I was hit by a car when I was 14, so I knew how much they hurt. What sort of idiot would want to be responsible for controlling one?My time driving was spent tying myself up in knots, second-guessing everything until I was entirely unmoored. My nights were worse full of anxiety dreams about speeding through residential areas in a car with no steering or brakes. Teenage me never stood a chance of passing his test. He was far too panic-stricken for that.Besides, teenage me didn’t actually want to drive. He was taking lessons out of misplaced duty, out of a vague sense that this was something he should probably do. He was reluctantly being pushed along by the expectation of others and, God knows, that always ends in disaster.I didn’t even want to drive when I took lessons for my book. I needed a chapter that demonstrated a growing intimacy between me and my brother, so I asked him to teach me how to drive. The lessons were good – and he made for a surprisingly decent instructor – but I packed it in as soon as I’d got enough material for the chapter.This time, though, I wanted to drive. I had a reason to pass my test – and that reason was my second kid. With one child, you can easily cadge lifts off people. There’s plenty of room for you, your partner, a baby seat and the driver. Add a second baby seat into the mix, though, and the backseat becomes an impossible squeeze of held breath and looming deep-vein thrombosis. So I had no choice but to bite the bullet. If we were to get around as a family, it needed to be in a family car.I’ve discovered a lot about myself as an adult learner driver, but this feels like the most universal lesson. If I’m going to do anything in life, it had better be for a very good reason. If I just let myself drift around on the tepid current of duty, the results will always be disappointing. Give me a purpose, though, and I’ll get there in the end. And the purpose doesn’t even need to be particularly dramatic. This time it was my low-level desire to take my kids to a Center Parcs. Obviously I reserve the right to post-rationalise a better purpose if I go to Center Parcs and hate it.Perhaps less universally, I’ve also come to realise that I might have a tiny problem with authority. On one hand this is a good thing, because teenage me was so absurdly deferent to everyone else that even making eye contact with another person felt like an act of obscene intimacy. Grown-up me has a more defined sense of self. Again, this might be down to having kids. When you’re a dad you have to become A Dad, a figure of benevolent authority who knows everything and can do everything and is always there. A Dad needs to have his shit together 247, whether he likes it or not.However, I’m also a self-employed writer. I don’t have a boss. Nobody has told me what to do for 15 years. They’ve made suggestions, but most times I get the final say. For the past decade and a half I’ve been a tinpot dictator in a one-man nation, ruling over a land of no absolutes or consequences with an iron fist. So my first few driving lessons, where I had to hand over my authority to a stranger whose job was to issue me with strict instructions, were hard. I bristled at the thought of being told what to do.But then I realised that roads are full of absolutes. They’re packed with consequences. Steer the wrong way, look the wrong way, disobey the rules even for a second, and you’ll end up in serious trouble. There is always a right answer and a wrong answer, and it’s only when I realised this that I started to improve. It gets harder to learn new things as you grow older, and so I had to very deliberately open myself up enough to absorb new information. Learning how to be vulnerable to new things again was tough, but great. Hopefully I’ll never lose that ability again.Best of all, I think I actually understand why people like driving now. All these years, the appeal of it had completely eluded me. Say I wanted to travel across the country driving would mean staying on high alert for the whole journey, limiting my concentration to just one thing. I’d much rather take the train, where I can spread out, have a snack, read a book, answer emails, listen to a podcast, maybe do some work. How was that not always the better option?But now that I’m an adult with proper adult responsibilities – now that I have to juggle equal parenting with enough work to pay the lion’s share of the bills – I find myself regularly overloading. The stress of always having too much to do has sent me slightly haywire over the last couple of years. I’m always finding myself spread too thin frayed and frantic and treading water as if my life depended on it. But having a weekly driving lesson gave me a whole hour where I had no choice but to limit my concentration to just one thing. I found myself getting excited about it. My driving lessons started to feel like a dip in a clear pool. It felt like a luxury.Now that I’ve passed, I can do that whenever I want. I can switch off all the background distractions and focus on one thing and one thing alone. Imagine, not feeling the need to instantly answer an irritating work email because you’re busy trying not to die on a multi-lane roundabout. Isn’t that the dream?My inability to pass a driving test has always been a sore subject for me. It’s been a highly visible flaw, an exposed nerve. But now I’ve done it, it feels like I’ve killed a 20-year-old ghost. It’s lifted a weight I didn’t know I was carrying. I’ll never get to experience all the fun that teenage drivers have. I’ll never get to assume that a rusted £300 Micra is a magical key that gets you into anyone’s knickers. Instead, I’ll be safely and sensibly transporting kids around in the closest thing I can find to a tank. But that’s fine. Waiting this long has taught me more about myself than I’ll ever know. It won’t last but, right now, I feel like I can do anything. If you see me in the street soon, please ask me if I’ve passed my driving test yet. I’m not scared of the answer any more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

But she was never alone. For one thing, her mates would never have allowed that…I have written a lot of things in my life, but this year it has become clear to me that I only have one story to tell. That thing is often in disguise – maybe it’s a political article, maybe it’s a cookbook, maybe it’s a collection of poetry – but I’m writing the same thing, over and over again.It’s this: it’s nice to have a friend.I’ve never written anything that wasn’t really about the pure joy of meeting someone who gets it and gets you. In everything I ever write I’m trying to articulate why friends are so good, and why we devalue friendship in favour of other kinds of relationship, and how all relationships are more complicated and beautiful and boundless than the labels we stick on them.The word “friend” has to cover all manner of sins. It has to mean that girl you work with, but don’t want to offend a mutual Twitter follower you’ve never met, but speak to every day the flatmate who makes you toast every morning. It’s the same word for someone you’ve just met as for someone who has known you your whole life it’s the same word for somebody you kind of like as for somebody without whom you feel like you might die. We just don’t have the vocab because, culturally speaking, we don’t really believe that friendship matters.“We’re just friends,” we say, of someone we love dearly, but aren’t sleeping with. “Just friends, nothing more,” as if friendship were a sort of place on the road to monogamous sex-on-tap. Because we’re obsessed with couples, with The One. The One is Friendship Plus. The One is the most evolved Pokémon of love. This is, when you think about it, a profoundly curious idea: a real multiple-egg-single- basket distribution error.I didn’t used to think like this. Even with my flexible definitions of family, expanding and contracting depending on who was around, I was pretty sure that it was just a question of finding the right One. I thought that with the right One, I’d do it all properly. Nuclear family with all the bits correctly labelled, like a diagram in a science textbook.And then, you see, I met him. He was – and I am unbiased here – really something. He was a smasher. He was funny and mean and beautiful and clever, and I absolutely worshipped him, and then he died.There’s a bit in the 2002 classic About a Boy that I think about all the time. A thing that tiny Nicholas Hoult in his woolly hat says, just after his mum Toni Collette tries to kill herself. He says, “That’s when I realised: two people isn’t enough. You’ve got to have backup. If there are only two people, and one of you drops off the edge, you’re on your own.”My person, the writer John Underwood, dropped off the edge by degrees. He had cancer, to start with then he acquired a brain injury and then he died.The thing about his getting ill was this: he got sick at exactly the wrong age. We were the wrong age. I was just 22, he was 25, 25 is a year too old for the young person’s cancer unit, where they have PlayStations and support networks but much too young for the “how to tell your children you have cancer” and “mortgage support” leaflets.Perhaps if we’d been just a bit older, we’d have had a house and kids and a marriage certificate of our own, and if we’d have been just a bit younger, we’d have gone home to our parents and been kids again ourselves. But we were who we were, and we had what we had, and what we had was each other. We had each other, and our friends.“Friends are the family you choose” is a trite statement, but I watched as it became true. In the mad world of John’s sickness, friendship became to us something as important as any blood relationship, something as vital and meaningful and profound as any romantic relationship.Other people our age were bonding over nights out and drinking and occasional trips to A\u0026ampE. Other people our age never thought about blood counts or sperm banks or any other bodily fluids outside the context of a sexual health clinic. Other people our age lived in a world that seemed entirely distinct from ours, like two pieces of acetate laid over each other. I used to come out of the hospital and stare at people in pubs on my way home, baffled it could be Friday and baffled that Friday meant something still.It must be said that we were a pretty close-knit friendship group before my partner had cancer. We did elaborate birthday treats and dinners that went on until well past the last tube. We talked a lot. We walked a lot. We lay around on the sofa, drinking red wine and playing the guitar, like people from films. If this sounds romantic, it’s meant to: it was.What else could you call it? I met Caroline at a party my first year in London we locked eyes and fell hopelessly in love and knew we were best friends. A little while later we ran through the rain together, holding hands and laughing.Harry – a work colleague of John, and a stranger to me – turned up an hour early to a dinner party I’d forgotten was happening we started talking about music and pies and we’ve been doing that, pretty much, ever since.Lily offered me a doughnut in a pub Lettie asked me about a (cheerfully gaudy) statuette of Catherine of Aragon in my window I ran into Cornelia’s arms outside the Gare du Nord on an unseasonally warm October day a decade ago now I saw Katya in a queue and immediately texted a mutual friend to demand we be set up. In the romcom world, they call this a meet-cute. In the real world, we don’t have a vocabulary for meeting people we don’t want to sleep with. If I have a flexible definition of family, I also now have a flexible definition of romance. Which gives me a kind of freedom from overthinking things. Freedom to be different to change and to grow and to evolve.And in that way, once John was ill, our friendships became different. Our meet-cutes became real, profound, life-changing relationships. It was only then, when our world had fallen apart, that our friends became our family. We were forged in a kind of emotional fire, I suppose, and the word “friend” started to sound almost laughable. They were there, too. They were in the hospital with us they were at the end of the phone at two in the morning. They were there for our birthdays and Christmases when we couldn’t go to our families for fear of being far from the hospital. They were there for celebratory dinners whenever his blood counts got better and commiseration drinks when things got awful again. They slept in our bed and on our sofa and sat in hospital cafés for hours until I had a minute. They smuggled guitars and expensive meatball sandwiches into sterile wards folded laundry and answered emails and drove cars and were, in every sense, there.Some of them I’d known for a long time some I barely knew at all. If you said you’d been dating someone for a year, you’d imply a certain degree of seriousness to say you’ve only been friends with someone for a year implies in some ways that you barely know them. But they were there, and they were family.“Friend” seemed such a flimsy word to describe a person who had washed your clothes and helped you dress a person who had driven you to the beach so that you could yell into the sea, and filled your fridge, and cleaned your sink a person who had pushed squares of Marmite toast into your open mouth as if you were a baby bird a person who had curled herself around you as you slept so that if you woke you wouldn’t feel the coldness of the space across the double bed. “Friend” didn’t carry the kind of weight we needed it to bear – it didn’t carry the heft of the burden at all. It didn’t carry the duty, the responsibility, the care. It did not carry the love. It’s hard to write about this in a way that doesn’t feel fragile or melodramatic or saccharine: we don’t have the language.With Caroline, we went for “my sister”, often sometimes “my wife”. Our friend Harry became our collective “wayward nephew”: it seemed easier than explaining the complex intricacies of our gentle co-dependence. A gang of women I adored became my “aunts”, sending hampers and cards and constant support. Mark was our “London Dad” Lily mothered me and fed me fish fingers as she fed her own small daughter. The small daughter – our godchild – drew pictures.They were there the whole time, and they were there after he died and we were all left, reeling. But I was not on my own. I was never on my own. We had lost a pillar of our family, but there were enough of us left to hold each other up.“Maybe you will be worried about being alone now,” our godchild (seven) wrote to me carefully, after John died. “But, you are my family and you do not have to be!” This part was underlined twice, in red pen, with a ruler.We are friends, my goddaughter and I, in that we talk about things that we both like (pictures of horses, Taylor Swift) and build Lego together and she tells me, cryptically, about the gossip from Year Four. But she’s right: we’re more than that. We’re family.We’re family in the way my housemate Tash and I are family: we’re a household, technically speaking, because we share “at least one meal a day together” (what a lovely definition that is). But it’s more than that: she knows everything that happens to me, because she’s the one here. We have small domestic routines, and all the tiny intimacies that you learn when you live with someone. I make the tea she makes the toast. I cook she washes up.“You sound… married,” someone remarked the other day, and I told Tash this over dinner and we agreed it made sense. I don’t think we’re alone in this kind of non- marital domestic set-up: every week I hear about women living together to raise their children, or someone living with his adopted granny, or some other kind of non-nuclear communal living. “I used to think two wasn’t enough,” Nicholas Hoult also says, at the end of About a Boy, looking around at his new, chaotic life full of relationships that are impossible to articulate. “And now there were loads of people. I don’t think couples are the future. You need more than that. You need back-up.”I see tiny signs that we might be moving collectively away from that cultural burden of The One: queer culture in particular has taught me a great deal about perceptions of love. I like this I hope it means that one day we’ll have the language to explain it. But until then, I’ll keep looking. I’ll keep trying to articulate it, keep writing 2,000 words to try and say it better. For now, though, I’ll just keep flying this flag: it’s nice to have a friend.Midnight Chicken and Other Recipes Worth Living For by Ella Risbridger and Elisa Cunningham (Bloomsbury, £22).

Why else would we reach for resolutions as soon as we’ve retched the last of December into the loo, repopulating our gut with promises we know we won’t keep?It is the beginning of the year, so we must admit the drinks we drink are wrong, the food we eat will kill us, the clothes we wear expose our lack of understanding about cultural signifiers of class, and that we are sometimes sad. We must change. But what if, what if we… don’t? What if change is bad? No, bear with me. What if, most of us, we’re OK as we are? What if we accept that we will never have the upper arms of a professional swimmer, nor a marriage of the kind seen in the background of romcoms? What if we acknowledge that perpetual happiness would not be a rational reaction to the world or indeed to life as a human, and that the constant pursuit of such a thing often obscures our view of existing contentment? What if this year we decide that we’re, sort of, basically good enough?Of course, there is merit to a considered reassessment of what is lacking in our lives, and here, look, is a universal date on which such a thing might start. But this striving for betterness, this dragging ourselves through a muddy park on the frostiest day of the year, this idea that if we’re not hurting, we’re not living, well, I resent this. I resent it all.I resent the myth that we can find peace if we download the correct apps. I resent the lie that we can become more lovable through Pilates. I resent the promise that we will have more fun if we buy less comfortable shoes. I resent the idea that a reasonable goal is to recreate one’s 21-year-old body in that of a woman who is now 46. I resent the message that my life is a problem that must be fixed.And this is a message that gets harder and harder to avoid. Today, self-help is hidden in every purchase, like vegetables cut up very small in a child’s lunch. Whereas once there was half an aisle in the local bookshop offering hardbacks with screaming titles about love and success, now, in the midst of an apparent crisis of humanity, January sells infinite efforts in self-improvement. On top of losing weight and giving up alcohol, traditions now as ingrained as Christmas trees or elevenses, this year we must also perform them (among other things) with quiet knowledge about the fattening reality of diets and the truth about binge sobriety. We must accept that, and do it anyway. We must seek deeper relationships, we must meditate athletically, we must constantly strive, like wolves of Wall Street, except not in pursuit of money, which is vulgar, but instead a better quality of happiness, which is less so.We do this despite the fact that this is not our first January, and that we’ve seen how the story plays out. Every walk through town is a déjà vu of gym membership deals and opportunities to detox. Every magazine regifts a diet in different wrapping paper, scribbled over with words that tickle modern anxieties. The word “new” becomes its own prayer, new year, new you, new body, new bike, new relationship, new job, new routine, new skills, new sex life, new kitchen, new baby, new diagnosis, new trainers. Yesterday’s efforts appear offensive in their naivety, soiled by age – everything breaks as the year ends, falling to the floor with a thud and disturbing crack.Or, wait, does it? Does it? Things become confusing – the streetlights are still on when we wake. We try to hold two thoughts in our head at the same time – the feeling that we must change as the clock does, but also, that every year our panicking efforts rarely work to improve our lives, instead leaving us with the sour emptiness of failure, and having extended our overdraft for the privilege. The two thoughts fight in the dark like cats.Is there a compromise? We could cut down on meat, drink mindfully, jog around the park, but with no ambitions of perfecting ourselves. That might be nice? What about if this year we seek approval, not from the internet, but instead only from those we love? What if this year, we forget about trying to live longer, and instead enjoy the moments of glee in our existing day-to-days? What if, instead of cutting all alcohol from our lives for a month, we instead interrogate the things that make us want to drink too much? What if, instead of looking inwards, we stare cleanly out across this cold landscape of gentrified possibility, making sure the annual efforts to fix ourselves don’t distract us from fixing the world? What if the change we make is the realisation… we might not be the problem?It’s worked - I’ve postponed learning to drive long enough that self-driving cars are a reality.Lauren Collins’s elegant New Yorker profile of bestselling novelist Sally Rooney (which I read on a train opposite two people reading her books) reveals her to be intimidatingly smart and infuriatingly argumentative, she doesn’t give a toss what strangers think of her.

It’s her decision to strike. Now she’s made it, I think we will respond to how things develop and try not to feel too much panic.”Ratcliffe said his wife was scared that her decision would result in further reprisals from the Iranian authorities after her food rations were cut last week and a programme was aired on state TV in Iran repeating allegations she is a British spy. In particular, the couple fear her twice-weekly visits with their daughter, Gabriella, will be stopped as punishment for the hunger strike.“Outside contact has already been restricted,” said Ratcliffe. “When she was in solitary confinement she went on hunger strike for six days and they sent her family in to plead with her. It’s not impossible that family visits are disrupted for a bit. And then when she’s weak and vulnerable, family is sent back in to plead she should end it.”He added that the Foreign Office had sent him advice stressing the negative physical effects of a hunger strike, which he found too painful to read closely. “We know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense, of trepidation. But there aren’t many ways she can say, ‘Enough is enough. Take me seriously’,” he said.Ratcliffe said his wife, who is 40 and has been detained in Evin since her arrest in April 2016, had made the decision to strike because she wanted to send a message that she was “at the end” and “cannot take any more”.She has been denied medical attention for lumps in her breasts and refused neurological care for neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, despite being referred by the prison doctor for specialist treatment for both. She has also been banned from seeing an outside psychiatrist.Ratcliffe has been struggling to keep his wife’s spirits up and simultaneously cope with his own anxieties. “This week I haven’t gone to sleep before about 2am and I’ve been waking up early. I carry on because you just do, don’t you? But I’ve been half dreading this moment and calming myself that the moment isn’t actually here yet. It certainly feels like the stakes have risen significantly. I think we’re on the precipice,” he said.He sees the decision to deny his wife treatment as an assertion of power by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. “They obviously don’t think she’s going to die this week and are just asserting that they are in charge. So everyone else can agree she needs medical treatment, and the Foreign Office can demand it, but they’re the ones who give the say-so, and they haven’t. That’s my reading of it.”Neither he nor Zaghari-Ratcliffe have been able to bring themselves to watch the lengthy TV documentary that was broadcast on Iranian state TV, showing secretly-filmed footage of her arrest at Tehran airport. “The other prisoners watched it. Nazanin couldn’t watch it. She left the room. But she heard it and she heard again the voices of her interrogators ... I still haven’t be able to watch it either.”Both of them found the broadcast shocking. “It’s the idea that, actually, all of this has been secretly filmed on a secret camera, perhaps hidden in a bag. It’s very violating.” He thinks broadcasting the footage was a way of sending a powerful message to the Iranian diaspora: “We can take who we want. No one can stop us. This could happen to you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Emotionally, many feel a part of their identity is being amputated.Brexit has “completely turned my life upside down”, says Fiona Godfrey, who fears being out of work in less than three months. A health policy consultant, she lives in Luxembourg and often works in Brussels and other EU member states.As a freelancer, she is deemed to be providing services and so is not covered by the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which protects the rights of employees. Deal or no deal, she faces “a daunting and huge undertaking” to find out whether she can continue to work after 29 March.While she hopes to gain Luxembourgish citizenship, if that does not come through soon she will be scrambling for legal advice. “I’ve worked all my adult life and it is a big worry to think that I might be about to lose my livelihood,” says the 53-year-old.Like many British nationals, she feels abandoned by the British government and is scathing of officials’ advice to her and other British nationals that the best way to secure status is by applying for citizenship in their host country.“I find it astonishing that the only way the British government can tell us to maintain our rights is to apply for the citizenship of another country. We are being completely ignored and abandoned and there is very little help from anyone, anywhere.”Helen Burnham and her husband, Duncan, a private chef, run a successful catering business in the Belleville valley, part of the Trois Vallées ski area, where they settled permanently 11 years ago after selling up and leaving their jobs in the UK.“We’re going to be the ones who lose out: British citizens in the EU,” says Helen Burnham, 42. “EU nationals may face barriers to living in Britain, but they’ll still have the other 27 member states to choose from. After Brexit, we won’t.”That could cost them half their annual income, she says, since, when their work catering for French, British, Belgian and Dutch clients in ski chalets is quiet during the summer months, they move their business to private villas in Spain, Portugal or Greece.She says she is “angry – at the whole way it’s been dealt with, how people have been treated: we were promised nothing would change. Well, a lot’s changed already.”Owing to what they hope was an administrative error, the couple were granted only temporary residence permits, but have begun the process of applying for French nationality. “We have nothing to go back to,” says Helen. “All we have is here.”Nicola James left the UK in the depths of the 1991 recession with “very little money in her pocket”. She got a job teaching English in Cologne and later worked in hotels, banking and on a cruise ship.“I am a bit of a poster child for the freedom bit of freedom of movement,” says the German language graduate. Nearly three decades later, living in the Dutch city of Enkhuizen, she finds herself caught: she fears she will one day have to choose between living with her Dutch husband, who has multiple sclerosis, or being close to her elderly parents in Hertfordshire.Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, once the Brexit transition period is over, her husband would have no automatic right to live in the UK. Their family income is below the current UK minimum threshold, barring him from settling in the UK if the rules remain unchanged after 2020.“It seems to be to be utterly Kafkaesque to be in a situation where you didn’t get a vote and you are suddenly asking, do I leave my husband to fend for himself or do I leave my parents to just get on with it?” she says.Twelve years ago, James was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and lives with a generalised anxiety disorder. She says Brexit is not helping. “One of the worst things for mental health is uncertainty.”This week brought good news when the Dutch government announced  British citizens could stay in the event of no-deal Brexit, but she is still gripped by existential worries. “I’m being exiled for the crime of falling in love and exercising my freedom of movement rights.”At the personal level, Gavin Quinney, who after floating his IT business bought Château Bauduc in 1999 “for the price we were going to pay for a family home in Putney”, reckons his family should cope, eventually, with the practicalities of Brexit.“We’re economically active, we pay taxes and social security, two of our four children were born here so now have dual nationality, and we’re finally starting to move on residence permits for the rest of us,” he says.“There’s a distinct feeling of ‘why should we even have to’ and deep sorrow at losing our European identity.” His primary concern is for his daughter Sophie, who has special needs: he fears a no-deal Brexit could affect the French state’s provision for her.His short-term plan is to stockpile enough of his wine in UK warehouses to at least tide him over until the autumn. After that, he says there will be a hard border at the Channel whatever anyone claims, and his business will have to adapt.“Frictionless trade does not exist outside the single market. Once the UK is unplugged from the EU system that lets trucks go straight through Dover … Our strategy I guess will be to use the transition period to move some business away from the UK.”The Italian government has said British nationals in Italy would remain legally resident, keeping their existing rights to work, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but myriad concerns remain.“I believed it would be easy to get a job in the legal world in Italy – it was Europe and opportunities were growing,” says Charlotte Oliver, a lawyer, who moved to Italy in 2001 to join her Italian boyfriend and became the first British solicitor to be admitted to the Italian bar council thanks to a new EU directive.“It was in fact very tough. It took 10 years, while at the same time raising two children, to build up experience and perfect my Italian.”Oliver, 52, went on to establish her own firm in 2013, but now faces uncertainty over whether her qualification as an Italian lawyer can or will be revoked, or if she can continue to practise as a British solicitor.Her rights to healthcare, a pension and freedom of movement within the EU, which is crucial for her job, are also at risk. She is applying for Italian citizenship, but that process now takes about four years, instead of two, under new rules recently approved by parliament.“It is immoral, and I believe illegal, that any person who has been given EU citizenship, and then exercised free movement, can be told our rights could be taken away,” she says.Matt Bristow returned to Berlin last summer fearing it could be his last chance. A 33-year old psychologist, he had always intended to live again in the German capital, where he owns a flat. Brexit forced a decision.“I have always felt happiest here and I felt the need to grab this opportunity while I still have it,” said Bristow, who quit the NHS earlier than planned and now works for a local authority in Berlin.Despite being fluent in German and doing part of his psychology training in the country, getting his qualifications recognised was not easy: it involved 18 months of form filling, language tests and legal translations costing hundreds of euros.At least the cost of living is cheaper than London: “I never felt like I had much money at the end of the month despite being in a reasonably well-paid professional job.” But he is increasingly anxious about no-deal Brexit, as his contract expires in the summer.“My worry is that I might be caught in a catch-22, that it will be harder to convince new employers to employ me if I haven’t got a clear residence permit, but for some residence permits you need to have a job or a clear offer of work.”While the referendum result left him devastated, he now feels frustrated with the process and believes British nationals in the EU have been forgotten by British politicians. “We are out of sight and out of mind.”After finishing her PhD Louise Howes, 30, moved to southern Sweden in 2015 to take up a research post in the astronomy department at Lund University, a contract that is up at the end of February.“My fiance is also British – we’re getting married this summer – and his contract runs another five years,” she says. “We want to stay in Sweden, we like it. So I’m currently job hunting, for something maybe in research project management or data science.”Howes says she feels a “constant underlying nervousness” about what Brexit may bring, a “level of added stress I really don’t need … We’ve been told it will all be fine, but there’s nothing in writing. If you’re in full employment it should be quite straightforward, people say – but what if you’re not?”She is also applying for jobs in Copenhagen, less than an hour’s commute away across the Oresund Bridge. “Lots of people do it, in both directions,” Howes says. “But I have absolutely no clue whether as a British citizen I’ll be allowed to after Brexit. Non-Europeans have had problems, I know.”More generally, she says, she is, like almost everyone in the university sector, “acutely aware not just of the damage it will do to British universities but the problems it’s going to cause for EU academics and researchers in Britain, and Britons in European universities”.As the hours tick by towards the Brexit deal vote on Tuesday, Les Buchanan, 75, and his wife, Louise, 71, in Barcelona find themselves assailed by an all too familiar sensation.“It’s the uncertainty,” says Les Buchanan, who worked as a diplomat for 40 years before retiring to Spain in 2000. “Once you know something, you can face up to it.”He still feels exasperated at being denied a vote in the referendum because he had lived outside the UK for too long. But the pressing concern is what happens next, especially if the UK crashes out.“We don’t really know what the Spanish government line will be,” he says. “At the moment, we’re covered by the local health service and the British government pays the Spanish government for expats who were in the British system. Will that cease?”He is also worried his sterling pension could take another knock and that the British government could use Brexit as an excuse to freeze expat pensions. But he is grateful that at least he and his wife should be able to weather the financial loss.“For young people embarking upon their lives and being denied the benefits and freedoms the EU provides, it borders on the criminal,” he says.The couple have taken the necessary tests to acquire Spanish nationality but Les Buchanan is holding off renouncing his British citizenship, as he would have to: “I’m very pissed off, but not pissed enough to say I’m not British any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aca4696937f570a4f6f3b006c65fbbd1576fbf4/0_325_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3196e2e5155ca1a69b58fa44ed670aa1","title":"eu preparing to delay brexit until at least july","story":"Brussels expecting UK request to extend 29 March deadline, with May’s deal on brinkThe EU is preparing to delay Brexit until at least July after concluding that Theresa May is doomed to fail in getting her deal through parliament.The country’s 29 March deadline for exiting the EU is now regarded by Brussels as highly unlikely to be met given the domestic opposition facing the prime minister and it is expecting a request from London to extend article 50 in the coming weeks.A special leaders’ summit to push back Brexit day is expected to be convened by the European council president, Donald Tusk, once a UK request is received. EU officials said the length of the prolongation of the negotiating period allowed under article 50 would be determined based on the reason put forward by May for the delay.A “technical” extension until July is a probable first step to give May extra time to revise and ratify the current deal once Downing Street has a clear idea as to what will command a majority in the Commons.An EU official said: “Should the prime minister survive and inform us that she needs more time to win round parliament to a deal, a technical extension up to July will be offered.”Senior EU sources said that a further, lengthier extension could be offered at a later date should a general election or second referendum be called although the upcoming May elections for the European parliament would create complications.One EU diplomat said: “The first session of the parliament is in July. You would need UK MEPs there if the country is still a member state. But things are not black and white in the European Union.”The European commission will publish a letter on Monday giving fresh assurances on the temporary status of the Irish backstop in a hope to win over some MPs to the deal but EU officials are downplaying expectations.The heads of state and government said at a recent summit that the withdrawal agreement, and the contentious backstop that a large number of Tory MPs fear will trap the UK in a permanent customs union, could be neither altered nor reinterpreted.But officials said Brussels would be in listening mode, and take guidance from the prime minister as to the next steps should she suffer a heavy defeat as is widely expected.May has to give parliament a statement on her next move within three parliamentary working days of the vote. EU officials believe that whatever emerges will likely require a prolongation of the two-year negotiating period.That conclusion is shared in a forecast by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a leading risk analyst, which will be published on Monday.Danielle Haralambous, a UK analyst at the EIU, said: “Time is simply running out, and we’re at a stage where Brexit can probably only happen in late March now in the unlikely event that parliament approves Mrs May’s deal on 15 January, or if parliament supports leaving without a deal. For all other options, the government will need to buy more time, and we think the EU will be willing to provide it to avoid a cliff-edge situation.”On Sunday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, insisted there had been “some movement” by MPs in favour of May’s deal while suggesting the prime minister would take guidance from parliament on what MPs could support should it fail.“The country does have a right to know what members of parliament are for, not just what they are against, and it’s important that the house comes to a view as to what it can back,” Barclay said.EU officials were quick to deny reports this week that discussions about extending article 50 had already begun with the UK. “The Brits have certainly not talked about this recently,” said one official. “If anything it is the last thing they want to talk about.”It has been suggested that the EU would respond generously, and even renegotiate the terms of the withdrawal agreement, should May pivot towards a permanent customs union in order to get her deal through parliament.One official said the refusal of EU leaders at a December summit to give May a 2021 deadline for the end of talks on a future trade deal was grounded in a belief that she had yet to offer a compelling vision that could get through parliament.“The leaders are much more savvy than people think – they can see what is happening in the UK, and they were left unconvinced that it would be possible to get a trade deal done quickly because the British government remains opaque on what it wants.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and commission official and head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said: “We think the EU will be willing to go back into the withdrawal agreement and rethink the backstop if the UK can reach a credible position that leaders believe will land an orderly withdrawal.“If the UK position were, for example, to evolve towards a permanent customs union, that could alter the dynamic of thinking around the backstop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd42f54b1ab7f8aee9d46cd21a77bbd55b99eaf7/0_12_2597_1558/master/2597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=736c62e859bf55c9fd2708f6653d984f","title":"may makes last ditch bid to win over commons to brexit deal","story":"Voting down plan would destroy faith in politics, PM to say at start of crucial week for leadershipTheresa May will make one final appeal to the Commons to pass her Brexit deal, amid speculation among many Conservative MPs that the expected defeat could spark a cross-party plan or moves to oust the prime minister.May is to start her most crucial week as prime minister with a speech at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent, where more than two-thirds of people voted to leave the EU. Reiterating her recent pleas, May will tell MPs that voting down her proposals on Tuesday would destroy faith in politics, and could mean that Brexit does not happen.“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,” she is due to say.“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.“There are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so,” May will say in her speech.But with less than 48 hours to go before the vote, there were few signs of the shift in opinion May hoped for when she postponed the vote before Christmas. A series of Conservative MPs have said that, while the margin of defeat remained unclear, a loss appeared inevitable.“I don’t think the defeat will go into three figures – I’d expect between 50 and 100,” said one pro-Brexit MP who strongly supports May’s plan. “It depends in part how many Labour MPs are willing to vote for the deal.”It is understood three Labour MPs, Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy, who ministers had hoped would support the plan after the government adopted their amendment on workers’ rights, will vote against it.Conservative backbencher Andrew Mitchell said nothing that had happened in recent days to change his mind, and the former chief whip said he was going to vote against May’s deal. “I think it creates more problems than it solves,” he said.A heavy defeat could jeopardise May’s position just a month after she won a no-confidence vote. One usually loyal MP said: “If the loss is large there will be some pressure on her to go. There is a sense she has reached the end of the road.”Another well-connected Tory MP said: “In parliament, the prime minister is basically there as the person who can deliver votes most of the time. If you can no longer do that on a sustained basis, it makes a mockery of the post. That doesn’t mean that she can’t carry on. What it does mean is the job becomes almost ceremonial.”MPs and cabinet sources said that, if May loses, she would be expected to make a statement to the nation saying that she will seek new concessions from Brussels before putting her revised plan back to parliament.While there is much speculation that she could try a different tack, such as seeking cross-party consensus for a softer Brexit, this has not been publicly acknowledged.On Sunday, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and transport secretary Chris Grayling both declined to discuss an alternative. “Let’s cross that bridge if and when it happens,” Grayling told Sky News. “Right now her focus, my focus, the government’s focus is on convincing people that actually this is the best thing to do.”Cabinet sources said that while some ministers, such as Amber Rudd and David Gauke, had urged May to consider a backup approach, little concrete work had been done. One source said: “The view is that there’s still a little bit of steam left in the PM’s deal. If someone is coming up with a brand new plan B, like Norway, then they’re doing it very quietly in a dark room.”MPs will next week attempt again to seize control of the process, with groups pushing for a Norway-style soft Brexit and a second referendum.One Conservative MP said the Norway plan – to keep the UK inside the EU’s single market – was gaining traction: “It is the only plan B with a measure of cross-party support. It would get you 80 or 90 Labour votes.”Separately, a cross-party group of MPs from the Lib Dems, Labour, Conservatives and SNP will on Monday publish two draft bills designed to pave the way for a new referendum. One of these would give voters the option of voting for the government’s deal or staying in the EU.Among those behind the plan is the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was accused by some newspapers on Sunday of leading a coup against Brexit in alliance with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow.Grieve, whose amendment obliging May to respond to the defeat of her plan within three days was passed by MPs last week, told the  the reports were “rubbish”, and had seen him receive death threats.“I can emphatically say it is totally untrue that I am in a conspiracy with the Speaker either to stop Brexit or to change the standing orders of the house,” he said.

It includes details such as age, address and academic attainment, which are recorded in the national pupil database. Figures released in December showed that in the year to September 2018 the Home Office requested data on 835 children from the DfE, which provided it in 247 cases.When concerns were first raised about collection of children’s nationality and country of birth, the DfE had insisted that the new data would not be shared with immigration enforcement authorities, that it was only being collected for “analytical, statistical and research purposes”, and that parents could opt out whenever they wanted.But when it emerged that names and addresses of children collected through the census had since 2015 been secretly shared every month with immigration enforcement, thousands of parents in 2016 heeded calls by human rights groups and teachers’ unions to boycott the questions.After a freedom of information battle, campaigners subsequently exposed a memorandum of understanding between the DfE and the Home Office that showed that officials had originally intended for nationality and birth country data to be used for immigration enforcement.In a move that suggests ministers had misled public over their plans, the memorandum had been quietly amended some months after public opposition emerged – and after assurances had already been given – to remove references to nationality and country of birth.Last month, Against Borders for Children (ABC), a group set up to campaign against the use of children’s data for immigration enforcement, began legal action against Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to force his department to delete the data it currently holds.Kwadwo Kyerewaa, a spokesman for ABC, said: “The DfE should live up to its purpose and ensure that every child has a right to education without fear of immigration enforcement.“Recent data-sharing statistics show that families are providing data that has been re-purposed for immigration enforcement without their informed consent. We hope the Information Commissioner’s Office will put an end to this shameful and shocking practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c5eab89954f3e9ec9d43aa57606fc995ad1da0f/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0737ebd7a556ab51ac573f26791c599c","title":"what does the week ahead hold for the brexit debate","story":"It is a crucial juncture for all sides as MPs prepare to vote on Theresa May’s dealThe EU is expected to publish a letter of clarification emphasising that any use of the Northern Ireland backstop designed to keep the land border open would only ever be temporary, although it will be a surprise if it makes much difference to the Commons arithmetic.Theresa May will also make a public appeal for support in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent in the morning, while MPs move on to day four of the Brexit debate, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, closing proceedings. Monday night is the deadline for submitting amendments to the Brexit motion.If May allows it, MPs will finally get to vote on her Brexit deal, although few believe the prime minister can get it approved, given that more than 100 Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.John Bercow, the Speaker, will select which amendments to vote on. The one to watch is the Hilary Benn amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and no deal, and gives MPs a say in what happens next.The prime minister will conclude proceedings, speaking just before voting starts at 7pm. A result on the Benn amendment could come at about 7.30pm. If that falls, the all-important vote on May’s final deal is expected between 8 and 9pm. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, could immediately demand to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, if she is defeated. A heavy loss, and May will face immediate calls to resign.If May were to prevail, business as usual would commence, starting with prime minister’s questions. But the DUP has threatened to abandon its confidence and supply agreement with the government if May’s deal goes through, leaving the Conservatives without an overall majority.A confidence vote could be held on Wednesday, if Corbyn calls for one. It will be hard for Labour to win, because in this scenario, if May’s deal is voted down, the DUP has said it will support the Conservatives in an attempt to get the Brexit deal renegotiated.If May suffers a heavy defeat – perhaps with 80 rebels or more – she may find she is not able to stay on. A more narrow defeat – 40 rebels or fewer – could encourage her to try to ask MPs to vote on the deal again, although it will almost certainly need to be revised first.May could make a dash to Brussels to see if there is any hope of renegotiating.

It’s something which is difficult for me to say. It still feels difficult for me to say, but increasingly I’m comfortable and happy about that, and feel in a comfortable place to say that to you today.“But it’s been a long journey to get me to that point. I clearly had sexual doubts earlier on in my life, but I was very, very happily married and really, really enjoyed being a dad and married as well.”Oaten was married with two daughters when the News of the World published details about his six-month relationship with a male sex worker, and how he had paid to take part in group sex sessions.The former PR consultant was only 33 when he became an MP in 1997, and made his name as the voice of so-called “tough liberalism” in the home affairs brief, moving the party to the right on immigration and crime.He stood to succeed Charles Kennedy when the then leader announced in January 2006 he was stepping down due to alcoholism, and was Kennedy’s choice for the post. Oaten dropped out of the race shortly before the newspaper revelations because of what he said was a lack of support for his bid.He quit parliament in 2010, and stayed with his wife Belinda. Oaten said his family had been supportive of his later change in lifestyle.“It’s something my friends have known about now, my girls know about, and my mum – those key people – but it’s only been in the last year, year-and-a-half. I’ve got a partner, we live together. I have a group of great gay friends. I can be who I am now. I just wish I’d done it earlier.”Oaten said his use of sex workers had been in part a reaction to life in the “seedy, bullying men’s club” of parliament.He said: “You are in an environment where you can buy drink really cheap, you are in an environment where you are away from home and your family, and you are in this kind of bubble where you are able to get away with anything you want. You are conscious and aware of colleagues having affairs.”Oaten, who left the Lib Dems last year, said he felt Vince Cable should step down as leader. “He’s failed and the party’s failed. I think Jo Swinson is good and great. I think frankly, Vince, it’s time for you to step down and let somebody new come through.”Oaten’s political career began amid some drama – in 1997 he won Winchester from the Conservative incumbent, Gerry Malone, by just two votes. Malone challenged the result in the courts and forced a byelection, which Oaten then won with a majority of 21,556."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be7f6acea089631169121d8beb909caff36bd38/167_120_3331_1998/master/3331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cad84ed2ba667c863e52784893d9781f","title":"starwatch total eclipse of a supermoon red moon","story":"The first supermoon of the year will be on show later this week, with a total eclipse thrown in for good measureA total lunar eclipse greets skywatchers at the end of this week.

That’s how difficult it was.”If the former world No 1’s match against the Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday is his last public appearance on a tennis court – as he fears it might be – he will leave to rapturous applause and the gratitude of a generation. Despite beating Agut in their three previous matches, Murray does not expect to win.The Scot said he was determined to follow advice from psychologists and delay making decisions about what he does next.“I don’t want to stop playing tennis just now,” he admitted. “I don’t feel ready, the rest of my body feels perfect.“That’s the hard thing about it. It’s not like I wake up and my whole body’s sore, and just aching, and it’s too much. It’s just one problem that can’t be fixed. That’s why it’s difficult. Look, lots of things have been weird. Like, the US Open last year for me was quite odd, because I was in a lot of pain.”There he lost to Fernando Verdasco in the second round. He lost to him again in Shenzhen – and that was it for 2018 – 12 matches, seven defeats and nothing to show for it but a seemingly ineradicable limp and dwindling hopes after 15 years as a professional.“I know I’ve got no chance of winning this tournament and most likely I’m going to lose in the first round. I’m not happy about that. Because of the way the last six months of competing have gone, I could win but it’s likely that I won’t. It’s going to be uncomfortable,” he said.“If it is my last match, I want to try and enjoy it – enjoy the whole experience, which is maybe something during my career that I’ve not done. I’ve always been focused on tactics and winning and finding a way that’s been the most important thing.”What Murray wants to do after spending nearly his entire life playing tennis is to have some fun, play five-a-side with his mates, and fit in some golf – which might have been his chosen sport, if his father, Willie, had had his way, rather than his mother, Judy, who steered him towards tennis.He could have been a footballer. But tennis, with its inbuilt frustrations and challenges, its quirks of scoring and circumstances, suited his mercurial rhythm. It gave him a canvas on which to paint his particular art. Few did it more artfully. Manufacturing a graceful departure has not been easy, though.“Coming in here, my mindset is… it feels very different. Like, the other day, I was saying to my team: ‘The thing that’s difficult – because I’m not practising anywhere near as much as I used to – is I can’t just go back on the practice court and work on my serve or whatever I’m not happy with – I can’t do that any more.’“But it’s interesting because once I’d started thinking about stopping, that there was a possibility that I wasn’t going to be playing much longer, all of the things that I thought I would quite like to do, I have zero interest in doing right now.“I have no motivation to do anything else just now. Thinking about what I do when I finish playing and rushing into decisions – from speaking to psychologists – is the worst thing I should be doing. It’s going to take time for me to deal with it. I need time to get over it and then to know what my next steps are going to be.“I know that will be difficult. I love tennis. I love playing the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7de074ae2c078d61d415702060c37e4e45159cc2/0_69_3715_2229/master/3715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3087a297ecd5be5ade1ef440cf5eb1e8","title":"england new zealand quad series netball match report","story":"It was a case of new year, same successful England, as Tracey Neville’s team began their quest for a first Quad Series title on a compelling note in Liverpool.Six months before the netball World Cup, to be staged at this same venue, England claimed a comfortable 54-41 victory over New Zealand to open the northern version of this tournament. It was not, quite, the statement performance England sought. But for a first effort it did the job, and set the foundations for what comes next.Last year’s Commonwealth Games gold medal victory over Australia, one which propelled England to the BBC’s Team of the Year and Greatest Moment awards, shocked the netball world. This year, England are intent on proving such a result represents a seismic shift rather than a fluke. While not perfectly polished by any stretch, this was another step in that direction.Continuing their recent dominance against New Zealand, with a fourth straight victory over the revamped, struggling Silver Ferns, offered the desired start to 2019. It says everything about the path England are now treading, and the elevated place they now occupy on the global stage, that Neville deems a record-equalling 13-goal victory over the Ferns not quite good enough, labelling some of the attacking skills scrappy.“A lot of people were wary that it was the end of our journey at that Commonwealth Games,” Neville said. “The gold medal for me wasn’t the priority, it was the consistency of results. It’s about beating world No 1 consistently, and we haven’t done that against Australia. Twenty years ago I started playing netball and I was sat in a room and it was about beating world No 1 and 2.“We wanted to be one of those people that people wanted to be. I can probably say we are, however, there’s still a lot of work to go before the World Cup. People don’t look at these results, they look at the major championships and those are the things we need to keep backing up.”The victory comes with further benefits as this will be the last time these netball heavyweights meet before the World Cup, giving England a psychological advantage should they clash again in the summer at the 16-team event.England, runners-up in the last two tournaments, have never won the Quad Series. But in this, the sixth edition, they will not get a better chance to end that drought and further enhance credentials.This result against the Ferns, coupled with Australia losing their star shooter and captain Caitlin Bassett to a broken forearm suffered in a training match last week, leaves the title within England’s grasp with two matches to play in London next weekend.Where once England played second fiddle to Australia and New Zealand, they now wear the target. That brings different pressures, and they should therefore be better for this outing. Back at full strength for the first time since the Commonwealth Games, with the Helen Housby-Jo Harten shooting combination restored, England should only build.Here the experienced Serena Guthrie and Jade Clarke owned the mid-court, giving New Zealand’s Sam Sinclair, who started at centre, a torrid time while at the defensive end Geva Mentor was her typical tower of strength alongside the player of the match, Eboni Usoro-Brown.England were held to a 25-24 half-time advantage but broke the shackles in a decisive third quarter to establish a 10-goal lead. They extended that by three in the final quarter, with New Zealand defender Karin Burger sent to the sin-bin for two minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8176fcd45487fd1e169ce891b615b646a05c145/103_1_4343_2605/master/4343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c93d4645cfbf7d12096f20dd8b5c32a9","title":"lyon saracens champions cup match report","story":"• Lyon 10-28 Saracens• Bonus-point win secures qualification for away sideSaracens became the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals with a bonus-point victory over Lyon and they will secure the position of top seeds if they defeat Glasgow at Allianz Park on Saturday.Glasgow will be playing for a place in the knockout stage after picking up five points against Cardiff Blues. They will secure it on Friday night if Montpellier lose in Edinburgh but a home quarter-final will be at stake against Saracens, who were at their efficient best in France.Lyon had no chance of making the last eight but they took the game to Saracens immediately. They looked to thwart Saracens’ blitz defence by getting the ball wide and enjoyed some success with all their three-quarters making ground, but the scrambling defence of the Premiership champions, led by Schalk Burger, was exceptional.Lyon’s head coach, Pierre Mignoni, reacted with disgust when Jonathan Wisniewski gave the home side the lead with a 25-metre drop goal, but a series of phases had failed to put a crack in the defensive wall. For all the energy of the Top 14 side, they lacked the calculation of their opponents which changed the game in the second quarter.Owen Farrell had tested the Lyon full-back Toby Arnold with two high kicks and sensed vulnerability. A third was duly spilled, although replays suggested Alex Lewington had knocked it forward, and when Saracens moved the ball left and drove hard through their forwards, Nick Tompkins took advantage of the prop Francisco Gómez Kodela lurking without intent in midfield and surged past him for the first of his two tries.Burger got away with a dangerous clear-out on Deon Fourie in the final ruck before the try and the flanker was not penalised at the end of the half when he went high on the wing Alexis Palisson before dropping lower to dislodge the ball and prevent a try before half-time.Saracens were by then 14-3 ahead and there was nothing contentious about their second try, which came from a line-out. Billy Vunipola’s long, flat pass allowed Tompkins to reach the gainline and, when Vunipola took out defenders at the ruck, his brother Mako’s inside pass allowed Jackson Wray to run into the space the No 8 had created.Tompkins sealed victory two minutes after the restart when he joined in a driving maul following a penalty that was kicked to touch and had the strength to break through three tackles. Saracens settled into a counterattacking game, absorbing pressure, forcing mistakes and using the pace and vision of Alex Goode to turn defence into attack.Goode created the bonus-point try after Lyon’s most sustained attacking period of the afternoon. When the home side found space it was quickly closed down and after the ball was spilled, Goode skipped out of two tackles and set off from his own 10-metre line.He had the replacement scrum-half Ben Spencer in support and timed his pass so that the last defender, the tighthead prop Kévin Yameogo, was exposed. Both teams were at that point down to 14 men Maro Itoje was in the sin-bin for a marginal offside call after the referee had warned Saracens about the number of penalties they were giving away, along with the home prop Albertus Buckle, who saw yellow for stamping on the leg of Will Skelton and then repeating the action with a twist.Lyon scored the final try of the game through the effervescent Palisson but their first European Cup campaign has been a sobering one with sides like Saracens leaving nothing to chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a0cdf0dab379deef9531ff1b72068c358fed6e6/0_271_4069_2442/master/4069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a621fe113a89e53e5691273efa5dec","title":"nfl divisional playoffs patriots chargers eagles rams","story":"Sony Michel ran for 129 yards and had three touchdowns and the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers 41-28 in the isional playoffs on Sunday to earn their eighth straight trip to AFC championship game.New England will play at Kansas City in next week’s AFC title game.

But as Kwame Kwei-Armah’s dramatic tribute – a series of televised monologues that will feature leading black actors including Lenny Henry – is announced this weekend, he is coming to terms with the death of his father a few days ago.The eight 15-minute films overseen by the director, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, are part of a ersity-themed season that runs on BBC Four next month, and were made for the channel by Henry’s production company, Douglas Road, in collaboration with Kwei-Armah’s London theatre, the Young Vic. They tell the chronological saga of a Caribbean family’s arrival in Britain in 1948 and chart its progress down the decades, eventually projecting into the future.“The central provocation behind the idea was to wonder if this community will survive,” Kwei-Armah said. “We are at a particularly significant moment in history and this story has been sitting in my conscience.”The former Casualty actor believes drama is the way to communicate the different social landscape of the past. “I wanted to show that what people take for granted today was not always the case. Lenny and I have said to each other we are both in the legacy business now. So it is part of our responsibility as artists to tell these stories.”The writer, who made his name with the play Elmina’s Kitchen in 2003, spent seven years running Baltimore’s Center Stage theatre, which gave him a valuable lesson as an immigrant. “I realised it is hard work. There are things I couldn’t say, that Americans could, because from me it would sound like criticism.”The monologues have been written by different people, including the award-winning playwright Roy Williams, and tackle immigration and integration, as well as making reference to the Windrush scandal, which brought to light the uncertain citizenship of many who had lived, worked and paid taxes in Britain for decades.“We were mindful of not making it only a response to the Windrush scandal, but characters do refer to it. They also refer to other big issues, such as the Stephen Lawrence murder in the 1990s and the emergence of the hip-hop scene,” Kwei-Armah said.The 51-year-old director grew up in Southall, south-west London, with the name Ian Roberts. After watching the television series Roots, about slavery, he told his mother he would trace his family and take an African name.At 19, while reading an autobiography of Malcolm X, he carried out this plan to reclaim his ancestral past, tracing his Ghanaian family tree back to the slave fort his great-great-great-grandfather was taken from.In London, his father, Eric Roberts, worked at the local Quaker Oats factory. His mother, a nurse, took work as a hairdresser and a childminder to pay her son’s fees at stage school.Jonty Claypole, the BBC’s head of arts, said the project is the first such collaboration with a theatre and external production team. “It was implicit from the start we would have a black cast and crew. This seemed like something television could do to mark the Windrush era.”Other programmes in the season announced today by Claypole include a partnership with the Phoenix dance theatre, A Very British History, a factual series, and a documentary about photographer Don McCullin’s travels across Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1020\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21c13f81c971cb169b4f497fdbf47181 1020w","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus.

Grease and line the base of a 20cm round cake tin with baking paper, then set aside.Pour the dairy-free milk into a jug, add the vinegar and leave to stand for 5 minutes, or until it turns lumpy.Tip the dairy-free spread into a mixing bowl, add the sugar and beat with a wooden spoon. Gradually add the dairy-free milk mixture – don’t worry if it curdles. Add the vanilla extract, then stir in the flour and baking powder until smooth.Scrape the cake batter into the tin. Smooth the surface and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, line the inside of a bowl with two pieces of clingfilm and overlap them to create an X.

Return to the freezer for 1 hour.To make the meringue, drain the chickpeas in a sieve, making sure you catch the water that drains out – this is the base for your meringue (aquafaba). Add the xanthan gum, cream of tartar and vanilla extract. Use an electric whisk to beat the aquafaba to stiff peaks – it’ll take about 10 minutes. After 5 minutes, gradually add in the sugar, beating after each addition, until the meringue is thick and glossy.Remove the ice-cream-topped cake from the freezer, spread the meringue over the surface in a thick layer, mounding it slightly higher on top. Return the covered alaska to the freezer and freeze for 2 hours.Remove the alaska from the freezer and use a cook’s blowtorch to brown the meringue. Serve immediately, cut into generous wedges. Leftovers can be stored in the freezer for a couple of days.Tip: Dollop dessert spoons of leftover meringue onto a lined baking tray and cook on your oven’s lowest setting for 1 hour, or until crisp. These will keep in an airtight container and can be served with more of your favourite non-dairy Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice-cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc751fae6ed3a974b955445066a90d3cb82c1339/0_81_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=badb9c9a8a058e7fec236669252720e7","title":"les miserables episode three recap the net tightens the plot thickens","story":"There’s heartbreak and no little horror as David Oyelowo’s relentless copper Javert steps up the hunt for ValjeanSpoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Les Misérables on the BBC. Please do not read on if you are not up to date.“There is nothing regular about this villain.” Ah, Javert! The pain, the humiliation. When surely he must know deep inside that he is the one who is a bit irregular. An excellent outing, prolonging the to-ing and fro-ing between Jean Valjean (Dominic West) and Javert (David Oyelowo) as the action moved to Paris and the stakes were raised. Cosette is saved. But how long can she remain safe while Javert is on the warpath?The net, inevitably, tightened around Valjean this week as Javert showed himself to be the most assiduous copper in the history of policing. Luckily, the fugitive papa and his blonder-by-the-second sidekick were able to hide with a convent of nuns imported from The Sound of Music, Nazi-evading narrative and all. (“Don’t rush to open the door, Reverend Mother!”) Phew.Before all the drama in the final third, there was a lot of narrative to get through. This is a quality adaptation, but without the acting talent to carry it, I think it would feel heavy. West as Valjean is pretty much perfect. He’s menacing when he needs to be, pitiful at other points and bravely majestic at others. His face during the court scene at Arras when he faced his destiny … this was the bit where a man pretending not to be Valjean rode to the rescue of the man who was not Valjean, but everyone thought was Valjean. The noises of the crowd in the court were priceless, giving their “oohs” and “aahs” as the prisoners showed the marks that meant they knew the real Prisoner 24,601.Of course, Fantine was great in her death throes. But this was another scene stolen by West’s heartbreaking portrayal of humility. It would be hard to find a more pathetic death scene, and there were tears in our household. I had to suppress a snort, though, at this hilariously insensitive line: “She’s dead and you’re my prisoner.” Javert misjudges the mood yet again. Read the room, Javert! She’s just died.Two years passed in the blink of a specially designed miserable font, and a great moment was bestowed upon us: the return of the hair and teeth dealer (Ron Cook) with his handmade creepy dolls! As far as I’m aware, this was an entertaining bit of poetic licence from writer Andrew Davies, conjuring up the idea that the doll may even have had Fantine’s hair. (Pretty sure this connection is not explicit in the original.) There was more misery to come – the title of this piece is never wasted – as not even Olivia Colman could wring an ounce of comedy out of Cosette’s horrible fate.Thankfully, though, once Valjean had had some bread and cheese, he was able to give all the money in the entire world to this ’orrible pair and go to Paris so that he could, completely coincidentally, cross paths with Javert again. Remarkable coincidences are the hallmark of 19th-century literature, so it is only natural that they should start to stack up by this stage. Of all the children Valjean should pass fetching water in the woods … it’s Cosette! Of all the police inspectors the nosy neighbour could report to … it’s Javert! Of all the nuns in the whole of Paris, it’s a nun he already knows! There’s no plot without these coincidences, so we have to forgive them. But they can feel harder to overlook in adaptations than in a novel, and require the poor actors to have to work even harder to style it out and make it look like this was meant to happen.Some beautiful moments this week, though, and you can’t fault them for a) keeping it real and b) being faithful to the original. However, I can’t help but feel it would be even better to watch The Tale of the Hair and Teeth Dealer. More hair and teeth dealer! More!How believable is the relationship between Monsieur and Madame Thénardier? In the first two episodes, I was hesitant. Why wouldn’t she run away from him? Why should we believe that she would stay? Neither character is an easy part to play straight and they’re far more easily portrayed as ghouls or clowns (as in the Hollywood version). But somehow the portrayal here feels real and menacing, with Adeel Akhtar and Colman able to wring the occasional ounce of comedy out of a tricky situation. Not easy when what they are depicting is so nasty. This was the most awkward bit: “Would you like the girl in here with you for a small consideration? No need for the wife to know.” This exchange encapsulated the difference between Les Misérables the musical and this version. Unflinchingly horrible and realistic, with a real awareness of just how sadistic these characters were in Victor Hugo’s universe.The onion is awarded alongside a large hunk of bread and cheese to Dominic West for having the ability to wring tears out of a stone. His relationship with Cosette could have seemed cheesy or creepy, and yet was deeply touching. She represents his redemption as a human being. She is his one chance to prove to himself that he is the man he says he is. Every wrinkle of West’s brow and every tiny gesture transmits this. Bravo!• “Gavroche, my darling child, to think you nearly got left behind.” Beautifully sneered by Colman.• “Are you the felon Jean Valjean?” “I’ve never heard of Jean Valjean.” Sometimes it felt like a competition to say “Jean Valjean” as often as possible. And why not? If you get to win Jean Valjean as a prize, I’m in.• “There is holy house of women. No man can enter.” Translation: “Normally we wouldn’t let any men in. But I have noticed that you are Dominic West. Please come in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6dc6e8729f32e73af98f56e589ee0ff8ad2efc/0_36_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a56079e6930f5128695b09647786f","title":"wendy searle anarctica race womens record south pole louis rudd","story":"When Louis Rudd crossed the finishing line of his 925-mile solo trek across Antarctica last month, the first person he contacted was Wendy Searle. “I’ve done it!!!!” the army captain texted her.It was the news that the 41-year-old Searle, a Ministry of Defence civil servant and Rudd’s expedition leader, had spent sleepless nights waiting for. “I’d known he was going to do it two or three days before but hearing he was there safely, that he had completed it as he’d set out to … I was elated. And completely relieved.”Next year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the women’s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. “It will be a huge challenge but I think everyone’s got one big adventure in them.”Searle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. “I can’t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can’t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,” she said. “I’ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won’t see anybody else.”Searle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office.Knowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. “When you know that, if you don’t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it’s a huge motivator.”Her family – her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son – are doing all they can to support her. “My children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They’ll say, ‘don’t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I’ve got you’. They’re amazing.” She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. “I want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it’s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.”Five years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. “I became hooked.”She discovered the first woman hadn’t set foot on Antarctica until 1935, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. “Being around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.”Despite the fact that she’d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. “One thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally.”I definitely missed my children. But all I could think at the time was: no one day has been as bad or is ever going to be as bad as the six months I spent pretty much on my own in Germany when I was 25. My husband was away fighting in Iraq, I had a house, a dog and three children under four I was solely responsible for, and six months of just absolutely relentless grinding tiredness.As a woman, she faces certain physical challenges. “If you’re going for a pee in the Antarctic it is decidedly easier from a logistics point of view to be a guy. Periods are also a massive issue.” She will take medication to stop herself menstruating.Training for her adventures has changed who she is as a person. “Doing things that push me beyond what I thought I might be able to do, that has become a huge part of my life. I can’t imagine not doing those things now.” Searle is still raising money to fund the £50,000 expedition and hopes to raise a further £50,000 for charity. She says it is more difficult to attract sponsorship as a female polar explorer. “People need to get behind female adventurers. I asked a well-known TV agent why she doesn’t have more of us on her books and she said: ‘Honestly, there just isn’t the market for it.’ I’ve heard people in bookshops looking for adventure titles say: ‘Oh no, I don’t want to read anything by a woman.’”This kind of sexism is a vicious circle, she says. “If you’re not seeing women and mothers going on expeditions and doing amazing things, then how do you know women do that?” But they do, she says – she is part of a community of would-be female adventurers joining groups such as Adventure Queens or Love Her Wild.Searle hopes her story will change perceptions about who should be doing polar travel and is dismayed by the number of women she meets who tell her they could never do what she is doing. “They say that without even stopping to think about whether they could. I’ve got four kids and a full-time job. If I can do it, why can’t they?”But she adds: “I think there’s definitely a groundswell of women who want to go out and have adventures. They’re doing cool stuff, they just don’t shout about it. They don’t need that validation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d814648a9361176523c74a896ef0ff0654dd349b/0_150_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=424be264750db9e3fdc3fe4a09d43720","title":"afd party to campaign for german exit from european union","story":"Far-right nationalists decide for first time to seek ‘Dexit’ if bloc does not meet demands The German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has voted to campaign for the country’s exit from the European Union if its demand for reforms within the bloc are not met.The decision on Sunday marks the first time any party has called for “Dexit” – a German departure from the EU in the mould of Brexit.If the EU is not reshaped in line with the party’s ideas “in an appropriate timeframe”, Germany must leave the bloc, according to the draft manifesto for the forthcoming European parliament elections agreed by delegates at a party congress in the eastern state of Saxony.Congress attendees also voted through a call to abolish the European parliament – the very body that AfD candidates will be campaigning to join this spring.“We see nation states as having the exclusive competence to make laws,” the text said, attacking the “751 privileged members” of the present European house.While both demands are now in the draft manifesto, a final vote later on Sunday will adopt or reject the entire campaign package. Elections for the European parliament will take place in May.AfD was originally founded as a Eurosceptic party, but rose to its current strength and representation in Germany’s national parliament after rightwingers took over and switched its focus to opposing Islam and immigration.Like other nationalist movements around Europe, its leaders argue that too much power has been transferred to Brussels, saying the EU has far outgrown its origins in economic cooperation.“We don’t need to abolish the EU, but bring it back to its sensible core,” the AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland told delegates Saturday ahead of the vote, saying the party “has partners that would walk the path with us” such as Austria’s Freedom party and Italy’s League.Concerned about scaring off potential voters in majority pro-EU Germany, party chiefs warned the congress against even harder proposals that would have called for an exit if AfD’s demands for change were not met by 2024."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c44c8f17d98382a6960ef890488099b180f22d91/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=531df14bfe16462cb829242dd3eefda3","title":"african nations call for recount in drc election","story":"SADC also urges government of national unity to ease crisis after poll result contestedA powerful regional body of African states has called for a recount in the contested presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The unexpected move underlines growing worries that instead of marking a turning point for the troubled country, the 30 December  vote and the deepening political crisis it has triggered will instead lead to a slide into anarchy and violence.Such concerns are urgent for regional powers well aware that extensive conflict in the vast and mineral-rich DRC has the potential to destabilise significant parts of central, east and southern Africa.A civil war between 1997 and 2002 killed 5 million people and drew in all neighbouring states.The surprise victor of the election was Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the country’s main opposition party. Tshisekedi beat opposition politician Martin Fayulu by a narrow margin.However Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, claims that he in fact won by a landslide and that Tshisekedi struck a deal with Joseph Kabila to be declared victor.Fayulu’s claims have been bolstered by DRC’s influential Catholic church, which deployed 40,000 election monitors on the day of the election and has stated that its data showed a different winner to that announced by the electoral commission.Sunday’s statement from the Southern African Development Community, which includes 16 states, notes the “strong doubts cast on the poll outcome by the … church, the opposition coalition and other observers” and calls for a recount “to provide the necessary reassurance to both winners and losers”. The organisation also suggested “a negotiated political settlement for a government of national unity”.Initial reactions to the polls from other African nations were broadly supportive of the conduct of the poll by the country’s much-criticised electoral commission.Though outgoing President Kabila, in power since 2001, can ignore pressure from western powers, including the US, major regional states have significant leverage. Kabila, who was constitutionally banned from standing for a third term, only reluctantly called the elections under pressure from Angola and South Africa. Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila’s handpicked candidate, came a poor third.The church has refused to reveal who won according to its findings, but diplomats briefed on the church data say it indicates a clear victory for Fayulu, in line with pre-election polls that had put him at least 20 points ahead of Tshisekedi.Fayulu filed a fraud complaint on Saturday with DRC’s highest court to challenge the result.Better news for the government was that parties supporting Kabila had won a majority in the 500-seat national assembly. This will consolidate the position of the former president, whoever takes power.Kabila has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.Tshisekedi would be the first leader to takes power via the ballot box in DRC since Patrice Lumumba shortly after DRC won independence from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba was toppled in a coup and killed four months later.DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world’s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world’s smartphones and electric cars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d81421e85dbb7fcdfb471c7cf6cb4dcfacaf90d/0_150_4509_2705/master/4509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fdc7e7623add7a7aaa4247f27b2356","title":"democratic republic congo africa ageing leaders close watch power struggle","story":"After a tumultous week, the streets of the cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are likely to be quiet on Sunday as congregations file into churches to hear priests and preachers call for the Lord’s blessing on a troubled land.Few doubt that the DRC is at a critical moment. The long-delayed elections that were finally held on 30 December could still be a turning point, leading the resource-rich nation to a better future. Or they could send the vast central African country, which has not known a peaceful transfer of power since it gained independence from Belgium in 1960, back into anarchy.Supporters of Martin Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, accuse Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the DRC’s biggest opposition party, of doing a deal with outgoing president Joseph Kabila. The announced results bear no resemblance to the real vote, Fayulu has said.Across the continent, the election and the post-poll power struggle pitting two opposition leaders against each otherhas been closely watched as almost everywhere else on the continent politics has reached a turning point. This year there will be more than 20 elections in Africa – from Algeria on the Mediterranean to the economic powerhouse of Nigeria in the west and in South Africa, on the continent’s southern tip. Younger voters are demanding change from an ageing generation of leaders, who are now seen as repressive, not liberating. New dynamics have been unleashed by rapid urbanisation, economic growth and social media. A new crop of leaders is emerging.One indicator is rising voter participation after a period of decline. “Where there is a sense that venal elites have stolen resources and are not delivering, there are strong protest votes. People sense they can really change things,” said Alex Vines, director of Chatham House’s Africa programme.In the DRC, the stakes are higher than elsewhere. The 1997-2002 civil war killed five million people, but the importance attached to ensuring stability is a double-edged sword.If it explains why the leaders of South Africa and Angola pushed Kabila, who took office in 2001, to hold elections, it also explains the absence of stronger statements voicing misgivings about possible manipulation to allow opposition leader Tshisekedi to take power.Comments by French and Belgian ministers on rigging allegations in the DRC rankled with African officials, said Peter Fabricius, an analyst in South Africa. “Immediately, it became us and them. The attitude was: who are these outsiders from former colonial powers to tell us our elections aren’t good enough?” Some analysts see a shift away from democratic aspiration in Africa and a growing desire for more authoritarian government. Even as Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, surfs a wave of popular enthusiasm as he moves his huge nation away from a hybrid Chinese model, there is a fear the strategy apparently pursued by Kabila in the DRC will be attractive to some leaders.Cheeseman said few powers had criticised an election campaign during which major opposition figures were forced into exile, human rights abuses were widespread and untried voting machines were deployed.“If leaders can see that they can get away with that kind of election now … what is their motive to hold a better one in the future?” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756684.1547409046!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao the dos and don ts to help guide your child s choice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThink of what your child’s strongest aptitudes are and help them identify educational andor training options that are in tune with them. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWith tens of thousands of new jobs set to be created this year, the opportunities for young people have never been higher.Parents can offer their children vital support in choosing a career or course that will help them realise their full potential.But there are some important dos and don’ts that should be borne in mind:Your perception of the opportunities and challenges open to your children are most likely shaped by the education, training or employment choices you made decades ago.They bear no relationship to the rapidly changing world of work.To attempt to direct your child’s career choices based on your perception of what is in their best interest may be well-meaning, but it could lead them to make choices that are not in tune with the most suitable opportunities for them given their interests and aptitudes.Educational and training programmes are changing constantly.A parent’s role in supporting a son or daughter to select the most suitable vehicle to progress their career journey should be to encourage them to approach the process with an open mind.Try to make sure your child structures their research in a systematic manner, so they come to realise which option most suits their own skills and talents.Websites such as careersportal.ie and qualifax.ie provide a treasure trove of information.Think of what your child’s strongest aptitudes are and help them identify educational andor training options that are in tune with them.Selecting a course with the highest points or an honours degree as the default option isn’t always wise.They are delivered through highly academic lecture-style learning environments. If your child flourishes in this type of setting, great but it doesn’t suit everyone.Accepting that a high points course in a top university may not be the best fit for your child is not easy some parents even feel it is a sign they have somehow failed in their parenting role.Nothing could be further from the truth.How your son or daughter learns most effectively plays a huge role in selecting the most appropriate course or training option.Aptitude tests can help identity learners’ strengths across a range of abilities if they are not sure themselves.Remember: everyone is different and the combination of factors that leads to their most effective learning style can vary.There is a wide and ever-expanding range of third-level courses, further educational opportunities, apprenticeships, traineeships and employment opportunities for young people today.Parents need to realise that helping and supporting a son or daughter find a match with a course or other option that plays to their existing strengths helps them grow in confidence and self-belief.It also consolidates their sense of self-worth, leads to healthier relationships, positive mental and physical health and puts them in a very positive place to enable them to enter the labour market in a role or function in which they will excel and prosper.The bible for information on higher or further education courses is qualifax.ie, a website operated by Qualifications and Quality Ireland.It has an advanced search facility that enables users to fine-tune their course explorations to narrow down the number of courses to a manageable number for detailed research.The nature of the world of work in today’s Irish labour market is most clearly outlined on the careersportal.ie website.Employers from across all our major industry sectors promote the opportunities they offer in video clips explaining their major career pathways.As a parent, exploring those websites is a useful way of both supporting your child’s career journey beyond school and empowering you to understand today’s world of work.In the past five years, opportunities for students to access Europe’s top universities in courses that require high CAO points in Irish universities have exploded.Thousands of Irish students are now selecting third-level choices in Europe, given the low to non-existing fees charged in continental countries and the modest entry requirements.They often involve securing two higher-level grade H5H4s and four O4s in the Leaving Cert.Qualifications secured in an EU country are recognised in Ireland by the appropriate regulatory bodies. Details of all such courses are online at\u0026nbspeunicas.ie.Solas, formerly Fás, is helping to ramp up the number of apprenticeships in traditional and not-so-traditional areas, tailor-made for the needs of the modern economy.Apprenticeship.ie provides a good overview of what’s available.

Photograph: Getty ImagesGraduates from apprenticeships and Post-Leaving Cert (PLC) courses are rated as highly as graduates from universities and third-level colleges, according to a major new study.The findings are contained in a survey of more than 700 employers carried out last year by education authorities, which is due to be published soon.The  understands that, overall, satisfaction levels with the quality of higher education graduates, at 86 per cent, and further education and training graduates, at 84 per cent, are virtually neck-and-neck.When these figures are broken down, employers rate further education graduates slightly higher than college graduates in areas such as team-working, commercial awareness and entrepreneurial skills.By contrast, college graduates are rated slightly higher on computer skills and interpreting numerical data.These findings will likely be seized on by the further education and training sector as a vote of confidence in the quality of PLC courses, apprenticeships and traineeships.Overall, the report finds that companies generally are very satisfied with the standard of graduates.However, multinational firms based in Ireland are least satisfied over the standard of foreign languages. Satisfaction rates are also relatively low for graduates’ entrepreneurial skills.These findings are likely to be of concern at a time when Government policy is focused on boosting the standard of language learning among school-leavers, given the United Kingdom’s looming departure from the European Union.Employers are most satisfied with graduates’ computers skills their ability to work effectively with others verbal communication numeracy and written skills.In terms of personal attributes, employers are most likely to rate highly students’ work ethic reliability positive attitudes and ethical and social awareness. They were slightly less likely to rate their ability to cope with pressure.The report also examines what skills are likely to be in demand among employers over the coming years.Companies say they are likely to need more graduates with computer literacy, management and engineering skills in the next couple of years.At further education level, companies say computer literacy will also be in demand, as will demand for apprentices, such as carpenters, plasterers, mechanics, plumber, electricians. Skills in businessproject management, and marketingsales will also be sought after.The Irish Universities Association said it was “delighted” there were such high levels of satisfaction with the quality of recent higher education graduates.“Coupled with consistently high employment rates for Irish graduates, both at home and abroad, this demonstrates the quality of the learning and broader educational experience provided in Irish higher education,” said Lewis Purser, the association’s director of learning.“The somewhat lower employer satisfaction rates with graduates’ language skills and entrepreneurial skills underline the need for increased outward mobility by Irish students to other countries for part of their studies, together with increased participation in work placements or engaged learning opportunities, and an increased focus on student project work and problem solving.”He said the rapidly increasing numbers of young people entering third level, and a growing emphasis on lifelong learning for those already in the workforce, all show the need for increased public investment in Irish higher education, to underpin the country’s economic, social and cultural prosperity."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Multinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversStudents will need to prove financial distress in order to get any payment, claims the USISenior health service officials concerned about access to some 45 key drugsCivil service volunteers wanted to administer system of fuel rationing from \u0026lsquostrategically located\u0026rsquo stationsGreen Party says railway line should be re-opened to ease traffic congestionCanadian Derek Fogie set up \u0026lsquoKiss a Ginger Day\u0026rsquo in 2009 to raise awareness of bullyingCampaigner criticises Varadkar but praises Simon Harris\u0026rsquos efforts in wake of scandalGovernment told it will need to make plans for foodstuffs for those who have specialised diets and rely on products from the UKMinister eyes index-linked welfare system and free school books for all childrenUnion says money is not the cause of unrest but it is the way to increase recruitmentCollapse of Grafton College has drawn attention to conditions for many working in sectorIrish astrophysicist Bell Burnell says she was overwhelmed with imposter syndrome when she went to Cambridge UniversityLocal people said walkers faced very strong westerly winds and poor visibility on SundayTeenager missing since 1998 now central to murder inquiry as garda\u0026iacute trawl for witnessesThe cash-for-ash inquiry has shed light on the North\u0026rsquos furtive, unusual political cultureFive adults, five children and unborn baby died following fire at Glenamuck halting site in 2015\u0026lsquoWe are all the one race, the human race\u0026rsquo, rally which followed suspected arson attack on hotel earmarked for asylum seekers hears\u0026ldquoNow I think how lucky we are to have two children who survived it fully"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756767.1547417825!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to make last ditch attempt to avert defeat for brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: more likely that parliament would insist on a second referendum.   Photograph: Victoria JonesPA Wire British prime minister Theresa May will make a last-ditch effort to avert defeat for her Brexit deal with a warning to hardline Brexiteers in her party that they risk blocking the UK’s departure from the European Union.Some Conservative Brexiteers welcome the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU in the event of a no-deal scenario, but Mrs May will tell them it is more likely that parliament would insist on a second referendum.She will point to last week’s House of Commons rebellions that saw anti-Brexit Conservative MPs vote with the opposition.“As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so,” she is expected to say during a visit to a factory in Stoke-on-Trent, England.Here, senior health service officials are concerned about access to some 45 key drugs, as well as foodstuffs for people with specialised diets and breast milk for premature infants. The only breast milk bank supplying neonatal units in Northern Ireland and the Republic is in the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh.Sources said the HSE was particularly worried that what are known as “just-in-time” medicines, which are brought into Ireland for specific cases, could be held up by any new border arrangements.The Cabinet will be given specific details by the Minister for Health Simon Harris and the Minister for Transport Shane Ross on Tuesday on potential difficulties in their areas, as well as plans for tackling problems that may arise.Meanwhile, the EU is expected to publish fresh assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop on Monday evening, restating its intention that the backstop should be temporary and promising to make every effort to agree a trade deal to replace it as soon as possible.Dozens of Conservative backbenchers and the DUP’s 10 MPs have promised to vote against Mrs May’s deal, along with almost every opposition MP.MPs voted last week for motions opposing a no-deal Brexit and to allow parliament to propose alternative options if it rejects the government’s.Mrs May is expected to say: “I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy. Imagine if an anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, parliament knew better and would over-rule them. Or else force them to vote again.“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.”If MPs reject the prime minister’s deal on Tuesday night, she must return to the Commons by next Monday to outline how she intends to proceed with Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn signalled on Sunday that he will table a motion of no confidence in the government soon after a defeat, perhaps as early as Wednesday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire Two years ago, following days of political fever, a tiny group of journalists was called hurriedly to Martin McGuinness’s office in Stormont. There they witnessed his final major political act, his resignation as deputy first minister.Physically gaunt, audibly weak, the Sinn Féin veteran, by then clearly dying, brought to an end almost a decade of unbroken devolution under a power-sharing Executive headed by the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin.By then Belfast had been awash with revelations for a month about the cash-for-ash scandal, which was politically fraught because it had been set up by first minister Arlene Foster during her time as minister for energy in 2012.If they knew nothing else about the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, the public knew it paid £1.60 for every £1 of fuel burned in a wood-pellet boiler by those lucky enough – or well-connected enough – to have registered in time.The scheme’s earnings had been uncapped, although it was then projected to cost Stormont’s coffers hundreds of millions of pounds over the next 20 years.People knew, too, that it was alleged powerful DUP figures had kept the subsidy alive when they knew it was out of control in order to let others take advantage.Sinn Féin’s exit was portrayed at the time as a principled move that brought an an end to “DUP arrogance” after Foster had refused to step aside for an investigation.Two years on, however, a wider story can be told thanks to a forensic public inquiry chaired by retired Court of Appeal judge Patrick Coghlin – an inquiry Sinn Féin had first opposed but then accepted.The inquiry has shed light on the relationship built up over a decade between the DUP and Sinn Féin. So much of that relationship was in secret, away from the public eye.So far, too, the inquiry has exposed multiple examples of where the civil service conformed to their political masters’ desire to bend or break rules, turning a blind eye.David Sterling, who is now the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, admitted that officials had consciously not recorded many internal discussions that ought to have been minuted.That, he said, was because the DUP and Sinn Féin were “sensitive to criticism”. It had become “common” not to keep records because such records are subject to Freedom of Information.Northern Ireland is a unique entity, he argued: “It reflects in some respects just the challenges facing the senior civil service working in this particular devolved administration,” he told the inquiry.Defending their handling of RHI, civil servant after civil servant used one word – “realpolitik” – to explain how they justified it to themselves on the basis that the end justified the means.A similar justification was offered by the powerful DUP special adviser Timothy Johnston, a man largely unknown to the public but one who has emerged as the power behind the thrones of successive DUP leaders.He was described by another DUP special adviser as being second only to the leader in the party’s hierarchy, above MPs, MLAs and even, prior to the collapse of devolution, Stormont ministers.Special advisers were appointed in ways that did not “comply with the letter and the spirit” of the law, he admitted – rules that laid down that ministers should freely appoint their own people.In a letter, then enterprise minister Jonathan Bell had claimed that he had made his own choice. In reality it had been foisted upon him by then DUP leader Peter Robinson and Johnston, helping to centralise power around Robinson.Ultimately, the special adviser knew that he did not owe his job to his minister but to Robinson and Johnston. That, it was suggested at the inquiry, was why he heeded Johnson’s instructions to delay putting in place RHI cost controls.The rules that were supposed to govern special advisers’ appointments were not London rules but ones that had been drawn up by the Northern Ireland Assembly, reflecting Stormont’s particular circumstances, to quote the DUP.Sinn Féin broke the rules, too, but differently. In 2013 it had appointed Mary McArdle as a special adviser. McArdle had taken part in the 1984 killing of a judge’s daughter, Mary Travers, as she came out of Mass.Faced with public disquiet, Stormont MLAs barred those with serious criminal convictions from such posts. Sinn Féin argued against this, but were out-voted by unionists, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.Publicly, Sinn Féin appeared to accept the change and moved to replace its “spads” (special advisers) with criminal records. In reality the inquiry has revealed how it acted to nullify the law’s effect.Former Sinn Féin minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said that his party viewed the law as “an attack on the peace process” and resolved to retain the advisers who were now barred from working in departments.The most senior was Aidan McAteer, who not only continued to advise Martin McGuinness but was given a role whereby he oversaw and managed both Sinn Féin’s special advisers and ministers.Ó Muilleoir told the inquiry: “I don’t think there would have been any difference in McAteer’s role pre and post the 2013 Act in terms of how he would have behaved and done his job every day.”In doing so, Sinn Féin was confident that the DUP would not make a fuss, since, to quote the then head of the civil service, Malcolm McKibbin, they viewed McAteer as a “pragmatist” with whom they had a “constructive” relationship.Civil servants, not just the DUP, went along with this parallel system of improperly appointed “super-spads” since they worked every day out of Stormont departments, meeting officials.In his evidence McKibbin said he accepted it because “whether or not Aidan McAteer had been in the building or not, and whether I had ever seen him, he could’ve exercised that same function from party headquarters”.The issue is not just a matter of titles and salaries, however. Super-spads were not registered as departmental advisers, so they were not bound by official codes, or indeed the Official Secrets Act.Meanwhile, there had been no way for the public to find out about the practice since both parties had an aversion to the Freedom of Information Act, particularly the DUP.Minister for the economy, Simon Hamilton of the DUP, dealt with just a fifth of FoI requests within the time permitted by law, while many were left unanswered until the Executive collapsed.Once it did, top official Andrew McCormick ordered replies to be made. Nevertheless, he later argued that Stormont’s lapses had to be forgiven because “unlike Whitehall, “it hasn’t had decades – centuries – to establish” roots.“It’s a very young set of institutions, and the tensions are multidimensional in the nature of enforced coalition ... You know, 10 years is a very short time in terms of organisational behaviour.”Illustrating the dysfunction that was accepted as normal at Stormont, McCormick told of how ministers sometimes live-tweeted as they sat around the Executive’s table during formal meetings.The inquiry’s head was clearly baffled as to why ministers had not been disciplined . Replying, McCormick said the nature of institutions created by the Belfast Agreement made them difficult to police.Censuring someone “who offends is actually quite difficult, both technically, in terms of the way the checks and balances work, and more importantly politically”, he told the inquiry.The DUP and Sinn Féin sorted problems “privately”, away from the eyes of officials, never mind the public, he said, though he accepted that Johnston and McAteer carried “a very heavy burden” and wanted the system to work.But not everything can be excused on the grounds of justified political pragmatism. Officials knowingly misled Stormont’s Department of Finance during the summer of 2015, senior civil servant Trevor Cooper told the inquiryBy then RHI was out of control. However, ministers and special advisers were not kept in the loop, while a mandatory review that might have uncovered the scheme’s perverse incentives had never been conducted.Cooper, a bluntly spoken official who was head of finance in the Department of Enterprise, said he was “not defending” what had happened and that it reflected a “potentially cultural” problem across the civil service.Ultimately, officials in the Department for the Economy tried to convince the Department of Finance that RHI was still value for money, implying that the mandatory review had been done, even though everyone involved knew it had not.Painting a picture of a bureaucracy operating in silos, Cooper said his department was more focused on protecting itself from criticism than on presenting the full truth – even to other civil servants in the same administration.Responding to a suggestion that officials had made “an untrue statement”, Cooper said the tone of their discussions had been, “We’re not in a great place here, you know – we need to put our best foot forward”.By then, many of the key DUP figures and their officials believed that the funding coming directly from the Treasury in London rather than out of Stormont’s own budget was “free money”.McCormick told Coghlin that Foster’s long-standing special adviser Andrew Crawford, who is accused of deliberately delaying efforts to rein in RHI, had told him that he thought Northern Ireland could exploit funding from London.During a November, 2016 dinner, just a month before the controversy became public knowledge, a “smiling” Crawford had told McCormick that Stormont “could fill our boots” with London’s money.Crawford has denied he had ever said such a thing.However, the inquiry had already uncovered a Crawford email where he told a fellow DUP special adviser that he was “a little confused” about why people were expressing concerns about costs.“If we go over our 4 per cent target all that will happen is that we will get more than our fair share of the UK pot … I would have thought that this is to Northern Ireland’s advantage,” Crawford’s email read.However, the extra money was not forthcoming from London. There was “complete dismay” when senior Stormont officials realised that Stormont would have to pay the bill , senior civil servant Chris Stewart told the inquiry.Up until then, Stormont officials had feared one day sitting before “a Public Accounts Committee, being very seriously criticised for perhaps having poor value for money ... that would’ve been a very, very serious situation.”However, the realisation that they would not just be criticised for allowing expenditure to run out of control but would be asked to find the extra money required “was in order of magnitude worse”, he said.Throughout the Coghlin inquiry, the evidence of many civil servants and politicians suggests that the overriding, if generally unspoken, policy goal of those working in the system was to keep Stormont in place.Personal issues intruded, too, however. Ambitious officials knew they had to keep on the right side of the DUP and Sinn Féin, because both had increasingly gained power over civil service appointments.Together they changed the rules on the appointment of the head of the civil service so that – uniquely within the UK – it was Foster and McGuinness who personally conducted the final interviews for the post in 2016.The lack of political competition facing the DUP and Sinn Féin meant that officials faced dealing with the same people for years. In all, they were left too weak to speak truth to power.Pausing at the end of his six days of testimony, McCormick, one of Stormont’s most senior and most experienced civil servants, spoke directly about his own role and that of the civil service in the scandal.Briefly emotional, McCormick said RHI had caused him “personal damage”. Worse still it had undermined devolution, in which he had passionately believed. However, Coghlin’s report could lay “a new foundation”, he hoped.So far the RHI inquiry has most damaged the DUP and the civil service, but it has also embarrassed Sinn Féin, illuminating some of that secretive party’s inner-most structures and deliberations.Texts and emails in late January 2017 show that minister for finance Máirtín Ó Muilleoir had to get approval from unelected senior republican Ted Howell, better known for being an IRA go-between in the 1990s..Ó Muilleoir had been asked to approve a plan to slash the costs of a scheme that by then had been closed to new entrants for almost a year, but officials fretted that he was taking too long.Fearing that efforts to bring RHI under control would fail, David Sterling, then the civil service head in Finance and now Northern Ireland’s most senior official, told a fellow mandarin by text that he feared Ó Muilleoir was “acting under instruction”.Despite being urged by officials to accept the curbs , Ó Muilleoir also consulted with senior former IRA members such as Padraic Wilson and Martin Lynch, who have no elected role and are largely unknown to the public.Ó Muilleoir told the inquiry that Howell had been “brought back to chair a crisis committee” for Sinn Féin but insisted that he was only consulting him “about the timing” of his decision, not about what the decision should be.No one involved was an expert in renewable energy, finance or law, yet they were in pole position as Ó Muilleoir considered proposals to retrospectively slash subsidies that had been promised for 20 years.Sinn Féin played down the significance of the Ó Muilleoir revelation, but it fuelled charges from political rivals on both sides of the border that the party’s elected representatives do not fully hold the reins of power within the party.It highlighted, too, the sluggishness of decision-making within a party where its ministers feel the need for protracted consultations with senior republicans while also being under pressure to make decisions.It may help to explain, too, the slow pace set by the DUP and Sinn Féin in office, and it will factor into the thinking of parties in the Republic considering any coalition deal with Sinn Féin in future years.For now Northern Ireland’s civil service is the most vulnerable, however. By choosing to largely adopt a position of self-flagellation at the inquiry, it is difficult for people such as Sterling to then make the case for its defence.Politicians, some with a vested interest in shifting blame from themselves, are circling. Last November Foster called for major reforms, including the possibility of putting the North’s civil service under Whitehall command.If carried out, it would end the independence that Stormont officials have enjoyed since partition in 1921, so it is unlikely to happen – not least because Sinn Féin would not accept a shift of power to London.But the very fact that such an idea is being raised by a senior politician – probably the first time that has happened since Northern Ireland’s creation – illustrates how damaged the Stormont civil service now is.Whitehall is taking more interest, in any event. A year ago Sue Gray, once Whitehall’s second most powerful figure, quit London to become permanent secretary in the Department of Finance in Belfast.No date is yet set for Coghlin’s final report, but it is unlikely before Easter. However, he has already given fair warning that some who have come before him “may be subject to quite significant criticism”.For now the inquiry team continues to sift through more than 1.2 million pages of documentary evidence and transcripts produced during 111 days of evidence.Stepping down two years ago, Martin McGuinness vowed that Sinn Féin would never again accept a “return to the status quo” where the DUP believed in its right to rule.However, the Coghlin inquiry is set to ensure that the rules of politics change for everybody. A return to the normal way of doing business in Stormont is now almost impossible.Sam McBride is political editor of the Belfast Newsletter "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756728.1547413144!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vicky phelan taoiseach is all talk no action on cervical controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan: Varadkar “doesn’t inspire me with confidence”.

Photograph:    Dara Mac DonaillMinister for Social Protection Regina Doherty has signalled an end to blanket €5 increases in social welfare payments with plans for a new index-linked welfare system.Ms Doherty said she wants to “take the politics out of what we pay” and to bring in security for welfare recipients, “to know that it isn’t within a row between a Fianna Fáil and a Fine Gael politician of what the increase should be in the next budget”.She added: “We can’t keep adding four of five hundred million to the social protection budget every year because we will never get some of the larger ticket items done if we keep increasing every scheme by €5 per week every single year.”She said that under a new index-linked welfare system, “payments won’t drastically increase, but they are not going to drastically decrease”, and that she is open to linking payments to the consumer price index or the minimum wage.“There are other huge issues that need to be tackled,” Ms Doherty said.In an interview with The , Ms Doherty also said that she wants to see free school books given to all children in the State.“Why should certain children get free school books and other children not get free school books. If we are going to talk about having real free primary education that we have been talking about in this country since 1937 apparently, it is about time we actually did it. I think it should be universal.”Proposals for a new auto-enrolment pension scheme were “ripped to bits” during a public consultation, she said, which could change the shape of the plans.Auto-enrolment is due to be introduced on a phased basis from 2022. Under the original plan, the scheme would see workers contributing up to 6 per cent of their wages, with that amount matched by employers. The State will contribute €1 for every €3 put in by workers.IBEC has called for the 6 per cent rate to be cut to 3 per cent, however Ms Doherty said she was not open to changing this. “We didn’t pull the figures from the sky.”She acknowledged that a hard Brexit could also halt the plans.“If there’s a hard Brexit then obviously that will impact, businesses can’t afford to do everything and take the impact that a hard Brexit might cause them so I think we have to be cognisant of that.”Ms Doherty also said there will be no increase to the child benefit payment this year.“I can be honest and tell you no is the answer to that, because it does not direct the money specifically to where it is crucially needed.”Ms Doherty has also signalled that she will introduce legislation for a new so-called “contractor’s tax”.“There are an awful lot of people who are contracted whether they are doing it voluntarily or involuntarily. I want to make it less attractive for employers to take on people on a self-employed contracting basis.She said she expects resistance to the plan but expects support from the Revenue Commissioners.“There are great examples for argument’s sake in Portugal or Montreal where they have what is called a contractor’s tax, so people who work for a single company for maybe more than 70 or 80 per cent of their working week or month or year, that single company practically is that person’s employer for all intents and purposes and shouldn’t be able to escape the 10 per cent plus employer’s social insurance contribution.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyMost polluting log burners to be banned within three years and coal could be outlawed as part of Government\u0026#39s air pollution planRemainers unite to call for second Brexit poll - on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal or staying in EUMost CVs contain spelling errors, study reveals, with misplaced apostrophes the most common mistakeTakeaways failing to provide correct information about allergens are \u0026#39playing fast and loose\u0026#39 with livesCurb rise in unconditional offers by waiting until after results to hand out places, report saysMother is killed and child is left in critical condition after being hit by carLes Misérables, episode 3 review: how much more misery can we take?

But it was obviously going to go to a woman.“The BBC has quite rightly decided to make sure we have a more gender-balanced portfolio of presenters in main roles.”The job was eventually won by Fiona Bruce, who received widespread acclaim for her first programme last week.She has previously called it “\u0027hugely insulting” to suggest she was offered it ahead of a better male candidate because of her gender, saying: “God, of course a man could have got that job.”Last week, Jeremy Clarkson, who was axed from the BBC in 2015, called Robinson’s interview a “waste of petrol”, claiming there was “no chance he’s going to get it”.“They just aren’t giving jobs to men at the moment,” he said of the BBC. “There is an argument that it’s been all-men for a long time, so what’s wrong with it being all-women for some time? I get that. That’s fine.We just, as men, have to accept we’ve had it. Let’s just go down the bar.”Davis was also asked about accusations that Newsnight had “dumbed down” while he was presenter,  as the editorship of Ian Katz saw segments including Kirsty Wark dancing the Thriller and Emily Maitlis interviewing the Honey Monster.“\u0027I didn\u0027t really notice it dumbing down,” said Davis.  “I don\u0027t think that by appointing me they were dumbing down. I think you want it to look like it\u0027s dumbing down while actually being deeply intelligent.”Davis’ PM, is broadcast on weekdays at 5pm on Radio 4.Please review our commenting policyMost polluting log burners to be banned within three years and coal could be outlawed as part of Government\u0026#39s air pollution planRemainers unite to call for second Brexit poll - on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal or staying in EUMost CVs contain spelling errors, study reveals, with misplaced apostrophes the most common mistakeTakeaways failing to provide correct information about allergens are \u0026#39playing fast and loose\u0026#39 with livesCurb rise in unconditional offers by waiting until after results to hand out places, report saysMother is killed and child is left in critical condition after being hit by carLes Misérables, episode 3 review: how much more misery can we take?

Mr Donohue said he is “appalled” at the way he has been treated by the 800-year-old debating society.“Either no one will debate - this has happened to me many times before so I’m no rookie to this,” he said.This is not a matter of misunderstanding, it’s not a matter of a glitch or a mistake. This is deliberate and calculated and it is all political.”The Oxford Union wrote to him in December asking him to speak in the debate and when he accepted the invite he was told that they would be “honoured” to host him. But he was later told that the Union had “filled the debate” so his attendance was no longer required.Mr Donohue wrote to the Oxford Union earlier this week saying: “I would like to know the exact reason why I was disinvited. Was it because no one would debate me?”The Oxford Union declined to comment on the reasons but union officials generally invite a surplus of potential speakers for a particular debate, and then choose based on the responses who to confirm.William Donohue, right, president of the Catholic LeagueWhen Mr Donohue did not receive a response, he published a video on YouTube in which he details the saga and describes how it is illustrative of “what’s happening to conservatives all over the Western world”.“I’ve never heard of a liberal or left-wing professor who was denied an opportunity or shouted down at any college campus,” he said.“There’s no end to the number of conservatives who are either not invited or if they are with great controversy.”It is the latest in a string of recent controversies surrounding the Oxford Union’s invitations to right-wing speakers.At the end of last year, the debating society was under growing pressure to revoke an invitation to Alice Weidel, who is leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the largest opposition party in the German parliament.An open letter from students, professors and alumni, called on the Union to cancel the  “grossly irresponsible” event and “show duty of care and respect for Oxford’s erse communities”.The president of the Union stood by Ms Weidel’s right to speak at the event but she later pulled out citing security concerns.Oxford students also protested about the Union inviting Donald Trump\u0027s former chief strategist Steve Bannon to speak, saying the Union was giving credibility to racism and fascism. The talk went ahead as planned, but police were called in to protect the students attending the talk, while their peers demonstrated outside.University of OxfordMost polluting log burners to be banned within three years and coal could be outlawed as part of Government\u0026#39s air pollution planMost CVs contain spelling errors, study reveals, with misplaced apostrophes the most common mistakeTakeaways failing to provide correct information about allergens are \u0026#39playing fast and loose\u0026#39 with livesCurb rise in unconditional offers by waiting until after results to hand out places, report saysRemainers unite to call for second Brexit poll - on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal or staying in EUMother is killed and child is left in critical condition after being hit by carLes Misérables, episode 3 review: how much more misery can we take?

The body called for a post-qualification application system, where students would apply for degree courses after receiving their A-level results. There has been a sharp rise in the number of unconditional offers being made to students.  Last year Ucas revealed that the number of offers with such a component had risen from 2,985 in 2013 to 116,945 in 2018.  In November, education secretary Damian Hinds called the practice disturbing. The trade union argues that the system of making unconditional offers for students with predicted grades is associated with poorer student outcomes and \u0026#34unethically\u0026#34 sways the student decision making processHe said: Unconditional offers have long played a legitimate role, for example in ‘portfolio’ subjects such as Fine Art.  But this very steep rise in their use across a much wider range of subjects is disturbing.In its report, published today, the trade union argues that the system of making unconditional offers for students with predicted grades is associated with poorer student outcomes and unethically sways the student decision making process.It repeated its findings of June 2018, in which it revealed that of the higher education systems in 30 countries, England, Northern Ireland and Wales are the only ones where admissions to higher education are based on predictions of achievement rather than actual performance. It suggests that a new system should be implemented, where A-level students make their university applications in the first week of August, after their exam results have been published.Applicants would then receive decisions in mid-September and be placed by the end of the month, ready to begin their first year of university in November.Proposals for a post-qualification admissions system were put forward by Ucas in 2012 but were eventually dropped over concerns it would cut sixth-form teaching time and undermine the quality of exam marking.However, the UCU has argued that changes to the education system since then, including the removal of the cap on student numbers and the increase in fees, means that the proposals should be revisited.Universities and Colleges Union (UCU)Most polluting log burners to be banned within three years and coal could be outlawed as part of Government\u0026#39s air pollution planMost CVs contain spelling errors, study reveals, with misplaced apostrophes the most common mistakeTakeaways failing to provide correct information about allergens are \u0026#39playing fast and loose\u0026#39 with livesRemainers unite to call for second Brexit poll - on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal or staying in EUMother is killed and child is left in critical condition after being hit by carLes Misérables, episode 3 review: how much more misery can we take?

This prolonged uncertainty is likely to see the value of UK companies decrease even further.“Most affected are likely to be financial firms and consumer-facing sectors operating mainly in the domestic market. Firms with international operations should be less affected.”Dr Korczak said increasing international operations by opening foreign subsidiaries or relocating assets and staff abroad should act as good “insurance policies”.“Unfortunately, this will have an adverse effect on the local labour market and inidual companies’ activities in the UK,” he added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

No one talked about football.Or, if they did, in England, they only made passing reference to the FA Cup matches. But, of the fervent attention normally devoted to the Premier League, there was not a mention.Saturday and Sunday were cup days. And without the Premier League, they felt quite flat as a result.It’s incredible, just how tight is the Premier League’s grip on the national psyche. From a standing start in 1992, it’s grown to become Britain’s most successful brand. You don’t believe me, you’re not that interested in football and you’re attributing my claim to the hyperbole that surrounds the elite of the beautiful game?Mahabis collapse should give other firms pause for thoughtA Populus poll found that far and away the most recognised British brand in the world was the Premier League. They tested 20,000 people in 20 countries with 10 of our best-known names – and the Premier League dominated, miles ahead of the likes of BBC, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, and yes, even the royal family.Hard to imagine, given the stacks of souvenirs for the House of Windsor on sale to tourists in the gift shops, the crowds that flock daily to stand and stare at Buckingham Palace, and the coverage heaped upon Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, but, overall, more folk worldwide are interested in the outcome of Man City v Liverpool.Remarkably, as well, reports GlobalWebIndex, the consumer profiling firm, a bigger proportion of the population watches Premier League matches on TV in Thailand, Egypt and Indonesia than in the UK. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University Business School, interviewed by Mat Snow for managmenttoday, the clever bit was in making the Premier League competitive.The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – ‘co-creation’ or ‘prosumption’ to use the vogue wordsAll the Premier League members have a share (the bottom three are replaced each year by the three coming up) and nobody has more muscle than others. This means that relative to rival leagues overseas, the difference in financial reward between top and bottom is actually fairly small (£150m to the champions Manchester City last season, £95m to bottom-placed West Brom). Because the playing field at least in this regard is reasonably level there is a chance, always, of an upset – that lesser clubs can afford to buy good players and give a decent account of themselves. They can, witness Leicester City, with a fair wind over an entire season, go on and win the thing.Of course, such largesse does not extend to the depth of the owner’s pocket or the strength of support and size of the stadium. So Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham enjoy the advantages of additional wealth and spending power. But at least where a share of the TV rights is concerned, the spoils are distributed more evenly.What every Premier League team needs in the January transfer windowIt’s this competitiveness that makes the Premier League so appealing. Says Chadwick: “On holiday in Sicily in 2012, a group of Swedish guys were watching Barcelona on TV. I was saying how wonderful they were to watch – Messi, Iniesta and so on – but they said, ‘No, this is terrible: it’s just pass, pass, pass. We like the Premier League – it’s fast and intense, a battle between big aggressive guys and quick, skilful little guys.’ It’s basic and primitive. Premier League football is about competing – to survive, to protect our identity, to ward off hostile forces.”What the Premier League\u0026nbsphas mastered also is the art of consumer involvement. Ironically, it’s the aspects that English football used to be so criticised for, says Chadwick, that have become its advantage. “I cannot advocate a sanitised, quiet, perfectly civilised afternoon, a tea party where we kick a ball around. A lot of the Premier League’s strengths, the speed of the game, the tribalism, the passion, are all caught up. If people were not irrationally involved it would not be the great league that it is.”The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – “co-creation” or “prosumption” to use the vogue words. Other corporates need to take a look at the Premier League’s success. It’s easy to mock the hype surrounding the league: the vast payments from TV and sponsors, the cost of tickets, the stars’ enormous earnings. But these, along with the breathless excitement of radio phone-ins, Match of the Day, and Sky, complete with its pioneering computer-generated graphics and Gary Neville’s technical analysis, all add up to a compelling package.Involving consumers, giving them a say, listening to them, explaining the product, taking it apart, inspiring loyalty, talking about it – these are all key ingredients in the enticing Premier League mix.The days when customers were encouraged to stay apart, to remain detached, and to take a back seat are long gone. Fans need, and want, to be engaged, to be asked about the business, to feel as though it belongs to them, that they somehow part-own it, and are responsible for its development and evolution.This means taking them with you, communicating to them treating them as equals, and not speaking down to them, not hiding or obfuscating. A tall order, but one that others have managed, not just the Premier League. Richard Branson steered Virgin to heights because he made passengers feel they were sharing in the airline’s journey.The Premier League is back this weekend. I can’t wait. See, that’s the effect it has\u0026nbspthat’s its achievement.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Forsman\u0026nbsphad been working as a photographer for a while, but\u0026nbspshe had only had a few stock images listed on Getty, one of the biggest stock photo agencies. In 2014 she learned\u0026nbspabout Stocksy,\u0026nbspa platform co-operative, which puts the photographer in charge of their own work.\u0026nbspWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK\u0027s social care crisisThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeThe sharing economy is failing because people can’t be trustedProfessional photographers find it much harder to make money out of stock photographs as smartphones and social media have opened up the field to amateurs. Many aspiring photographers now sell stock photos at a loss to try and make a name for themselves. Agencies have a steady flow of this under-priced content, making it harder to professionals, who are stuck in one-to-one relationships with little bargaining power, to command worthwhile fees.“Photographers can\u0027t act as a group for their interests against exploitative agencies,” Forsman says. “The co-op model makes the photographers organised as an agency, which means that there is nobody to exploit them.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMike Cook, acting chief executive of Stocksy, says putting the workers in control of the business was “a no-brainer”.“Why don’t all businesses work this way?” he says. Stocksy has high-standards for artists that means it can command higher fees, avoiding a race-to-the-bottom in the industry. At Stocksy, photographers get between 50 and 75 per cent of the proceeds when their stock photos are used, significantly higher than the 30 per cent or less offered by other agencies.Forsman says: “This makes it much easier for me to depend on stock for revenue, because the co-op does not exploit contributors but instead seeks to make their work financially sustainable.”Co-operatives have been around since the 19th Century, but technology has opened up new possibilities for how they are run. Next-generation platform co-ops, which bring together global communities of traders in an industry, have been seen as one answer to the problematic gig economy. They are an alternative to top-down platforms like Uber and Airbnb, where executives profit from gig workers who may lack the security of a proper contract and benefits like holiday and sick pay.Platform co-ops are growing in popularity in the UK. In December Equal Care Co-op, or Eccoo, started recruiting care workers in the Calder Valley for a new kind of social care, where those receiving and giving care are in charge of the business, including how much they work and for how long. Rather than changing a commission and extracting value from the workers and those receiving care, Eccoo provides a platform for workers and those receiving care to choose one another and gives them control over how how and for how long they are supported.Eccoo is offering a vital alternative to care agencies that pay minimum wage to employees who have little say over their hours and may be fired on a “one strike and you’re out” system. “The biggest issue for me was having the reassurance of getting enough work and having theright amount,” says Fran Watson, a founding member of equal care and an independent care worker. “I know of no independent care workers who do 15-minute slots. You just can’t do it. The options are either to go with an agency or go it alone.”Forsman, a London-based photographer (Courtesy Photo)In 2017, New Internationalist, a magazine dedicated to social justice and equality, raised £704,114 through community shares, offering its readers the chance to own the magazine in return for securing its future. The editorial staff are still hammering out the processes that readers will contribute to decisions at the magazine.\u0026nbsp“The feelings range from anxiety about what ceding control would look like to excitement about what that represents,” says Hazel Healy, an editor of New Internationalist. “I think it would be hugely beneficial to us and a great experiment to deepen the democracy further but it’s going to need to be cleverly done.”\u0026nbspNew Internationalist has been talking to Stocksy about proprietary software it uses to support decision-making among artists from all over the globe. When Mike Cook first joined Stocksy, the business was making decisions the old-fashioned way, by members submitting motions that were voted on at an annual general meeting.\u0026nbspThis model had its limitations for members that were based in different timezones and speaking different languages. So Stocksy created a system where a contributor can submit an idea, however vague, into a forum for discussion. Members are sent an email to vote if the idea should be advanced. When a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of members have voted yes to a proposal, it is advanced to the board where it can either be approved, or go to a vote.\u0026nbspThe system has already been used to give members the say on whether the membership cap at Stocksy should be lifted. Cook says the decision was one of the most contentious the co-operative had ever faced. “We have customers who love our content but tell us that we don’t have enough. We have worked with our members to create more content where we can, but we have a bell-curve of members, from stay-at-home parents who take photos part time, to full time photographers, make their living from stock.”The membership cap of 1000 artists was forcing Stocksy to prioritise more productive photographers. “It’s hard to say you must produce more or we cut you off,” Cook says. “This is what the cap was making us do, we realised when we got close to the cap we might have to replace some users with more productive ones.”\u0026nbspAt the same time, longstanding Stocksy contributors were worried that lifting the cap would “open the floodgates” of contributors, Cook says, watering down the agency’s reputation for quality. Sara Wager, a hobbiest astrophotographer who creates one or two images of the stars each month, joined Stocksy in 2017. She worried that lifting the cap might stop photographers with a smaller output from contributing. “I reached out to the Stocksy folk and they understood that I have niche images that can take many months to complete and so my uploads will be sporadic,” she says. “They really put my mind at rest that I was as valued a member as anyone else.”Sara was also able to participate in forums discussing lifting the cap. When the proposal was voted through, the board reached a compromise where members could vote to freeze membership each year, depending on how many contributors have been added. “This combination of informal talk, transparency and more formal processes of voting means that I feel a belonging and co-ownership to the co-op,” says Forsman.\u0026nbspStocksy, which employs 29 people at its base in British Columbia and several more in the US, sells photos to larger agencies, tech companies and other business. It had revenues of $10 million in 2018, making it much smaller than standard industry agencies like Getty and iStock. But its business model means that the photographers can command a fairer price than they might at much larger agencies. Cook says that while their decision-making processes might take longer, the transparent process means that photographers feel a sense of loyalty and community at Stocksy that is missing elsewhere.“I realise in the wrong company I’ll sound like a raving socialist,” Cook says. “But the reason we have a business is the contributors, so why shouldn’t they fairly profit from that? It’s not socialism, it’s fairness.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This prolonged uncertainty is likely to see the value of UK companies decrease even further.“Most affected are likely to be financial firms and consumer-facing sectors operating mainly in the domestic market. Firms with international operations should be less affected.”Dr Korczak said increasing international operations by opening foreign subsidiaries or relocating assets and staff abroad should act as good “insurance policies”.“Unfortunately, this will have an adverse effect on the local labour market and inidual companies’ activities in the UK,” he added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

The EIU believes Brussels will agree to an extension, meaning Britain will remain in the trade bloc beyond the planned exit date.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe forecaster said there was a 40 per cent chance Mrs May’s deal would eventually be approved by parliament in a subsequent vote, should the prime minister gain further assurances from the EU.There\u0026nbspis now a 30 per cent probability of a second referendum being called to break the political deadlock, according to the EIU forecast. The longer the impasse lasts, the more likely a Final Say vote will be used to give one particular plan “legitimacy”.The Tories will lose young people for good over BrexitLabour braced to call confidence vote in government within days‘Small number’ of military staff helping with no-deal planningRevoking Article 50 is ‘the only sensible course’, says John MajorDanielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the EIU, explained: “Time is simply running out, and we’re at a stage where Brexit can probably only happen in late March now, in the unlikely event that parliament approves Mrs May’s deal on January 15th or if parliament supports leaving without a deal.“For all other options\u0026nbspthe government will need to buy more time, and we think the EU will be willing to provide it to avoid a cliff-edge situation.“Ms May and her government are not prepared to run down the Article 50 clock and leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement and transition arrangements in place, although this remains a possible Brexit outcome later in 2019.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

The MPs\u0026nbsprecommend\u0026nbspthe ballot paper be worded: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union on the negotiated terms?”Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the bill provides an “escape hatch” if there is no majority in parliament for Ms May’s deal or the no-deal option.The prime minister is expected to travel to Stoke-on-Trent, a strongly\u0026nbspleave-supporting area, later on Monday to deliver a speech urging MPs to back her deal.Additional reporting by Press AssociationThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is gutter politics.\u0026nbsp“History shows us appeasement only emboldens the far right and impoverishing the country through Brexit will only increase resentment.”Ms Soubry, who was branded a Nazi\u0026nbspby a mob who targeted her during live television interviews outside parliament on Monday, described Mr Grayling\u0027s comments as irresponsible nonsense.She tweeted: The 15 yobs who have been roaming outside parliament do not represent anyone but themselves. It\u0027s shameful to validate them in this way.Right-wing extremists have always existed. Brexit is just an excuse - this is their real agenda.Pro-EU MP Luciana\u0026nbspBerger\u0026nbspaccused Mr Grayling of “cowering behind the small threat of far-right extremism” to avoid offering the public another referendum.The Labour MP, who has been subjected to relentless abuse and death threats, said: “These remarks are not only grossly irresponsible but also show just how desperate supporters of this proposed withdrawal agreement have become.“We absolutely need to heal isions in our society but we will not do so with a Brexit that makes us poorer and offers less control.“And the answer to a small band of far-right thugs roaming the streets must never be to capitulate and restrict our democratic engagement – it must be more democracy.”Labour veteran Roy\u0026nbspHattersley\u0026nbspdismissed the claims as “absurd”, adding: “I don’t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters.”Lord\u0026nbspHattersley, a former Labour deputy leader who backs a Final Say referendum, told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: “Nobody voted for Mrs May’s package. Nobody had the faintest idea what Mrs May’s package would be.“It’s only reasonable that now we do know what it amounts to, what leaving really means, that people have an opportunity to vote on that. It’s a different vote.”Lord Hattersley was due to address a People’s Vote rally in Sheffield on Saturday, along with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable, but had to pull out due to illness.The row over the transport secretary’s comments comes after a week of heightened tensions in Westminster, when\u0026nbspBrexit secretary Stephen Barclay was condemned by MPs for saying\u0026nbspthe abuse hurled at MPs showed it would be too “isive” to stage another public vote.The Independent revealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Not just Leavers. Most Remainers do too.They accepted their referendum defeat with a grace that would shame Tories like Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and most of Labour’s MPs,they had enough humility to feel it.Yesterday Bercow let the Commons vote, without debate, to force Theresa May to produce a Brexit “Plan B” in three working daysand when her deal is rejected next Tuesday. The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street. Parts of London looking like a Mexican drug-war zone. What’s the Mayor doing about it Or is he too busy banning fast food ads, blowing millions on fireworks promoting the EU or vacuously boasting “London Is Open”, asit would ever close PR opportunities are all that interest Sadiq Khan.

It is going to be very hard”.The biggest Commons defeat on record was by a majority of , against the minority Labour government in .The largest post-war defeat was by , on the Callaghan minority Government in .Meanwhile, Business Secretary Greg Clark became the most senior Tory to publicly break ranks and call on all MPs to make fresh compromises for a softer Brexit deal yesterday.As the PM’s authority continues to collapse, the Cabinet minister appeared to have already dismissed any hope of the PM winning the key vote next Tuesday.Instead, Mr Clark branded no deal “a disaster” and WTO terms “a dire prospect”.And he called on Parliament to “move quickly and act responsibly”.He added: “Parliament needs to recognise we need to put dferences aside. I hope colleagues in the days ahead will recognise our collective responsibility to get a deal”.No refused to slap down Mr Clark, in a sign of the PM’s weakness, but said “disaster” was not a word the PM would use.The DUP, whose  MPs the PM relies on to prop up her minority government, also kept up their hard line.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Leavers won’t. It’s too late for that. A supersoft Brexit will solve nothing.It will simply pour fuel on the flames — and finally flush the public’s faith in our Parliament and mainstream politicians down the sewer.NO wonder economic migrants chance their arm on a perilous and illegal dinghy voyage across the Channel when we are so woefully incompetent at kicking them back out.What is the point of our asylum process at allless than half those whose applications and appeals fail are sent home  Even the man previously running Home Office immigration enforcement knows it to be a shambolic disgrace.Some “refugees” now endure a -mile crossing from Belgium to Lincolnshire to dodge patrols.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When nobody  knows what to do, everyone turns to you and hopes you can fix it.It means coming home from work, exhausted,  having to keep to yourself what happened on the ward today because its too upsetting to talk about. .It means calling your loved ones as you leave work after a particularly tough day because you need a voice on the other end to talk to. It doesnt matter what you talk about, just something to distract you from bursting into tears as you walk to your car.It means getting up for work the following morning, brushing it all off and going at it again because you are a nurse, this is what you do and you love it.I am not a nurse.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s my favourite.”Before going any further, it seems wise to make sure that our , aged six to nine, all know what Brexit is.Oliver Forster, also eight, from Houghton-le-Spring, Co Durham, says: “I think it’s something to do with what we’ve all had for our ­breakfast.”Seven-year-old James Eley, from Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, seems relieved by Oliver’s explanation, saying: “That’s good. I thought it sounded like a disease. It made me scared.“I didn’t know what everybody was being so serious about. So what’s a referendum then ”“It sounds like a Pokemon move,” says Cyrus confidently.Layla Thompson, eight, from Newton Ayclfe, Co Durham, adds: “It’s a football match between London and the rest of the country, I think.”Next, the kids are asked who is in charge of Brexit.When shown a picture of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Cyrus says: “I think he’s like a ­person from Harry Potter who’s just had a laughing spell put on him.”James adds: “He’s a scary old man,” while Oliver says: “I think he’s on ­Britain’s Got Talent.”Clover Cooper, six, from Darlington, suggests: “The TV ­sometimes has people at the bottom of the screen that do actions and he’s one of those.”The Prime Minister is a little more recognisable to the group, who are shown a video of her dancing on to the stage at the Tory Party conference last year.Cyrus says: “I have seen her on the news, it’s Theresa May. If she walked in right now I’d roast her because of her dance moves. She’d probably trip on the chairs.”Kaci Jo Bell, six, from Middlesbrough, adds: “She’s walking so funny, it looks like she’s about to fall over. Is she a clown  I think I’d get on with her.”When Marnie Harper, six, from Middlesbrough, is asked who her dream Prime Minister would be, she says: “My dad! He is my favourite person and he is bossy.”James ­suspects Donald Trump is at the heart of Brexit and says: “I think he’s in charge.“I’ve seen him on the news. He looks like he’s trying to be good but he’s naughty most of the time. Sometimes there are ­accidents. He doesn’t do them but other people ask himhe’s done it and he ­sometimes says yes and sometimes no.”Nine-year-old Ava Hancock, from Newton Ayclfe, says: “I thought he looked a bit orange.”Cyrus says: “When I saw Donald Trump on the news I thought about his wig and how it did not look like actual hair, even though he tried to make it look like hair.“Also, he looked like a chicken on an advert, you know, when they make a chicken nice and golden.”Next, the kids are asked who they’d like to take charge of Brexit.Clover says: “The giant from Jack And The Beanstalk, becauseanyone did do something wrong he would climb down the beanstalk and get them, so he’d be a really good Prime Minister.“Also Mr Tickle, as he has really stretchy arms and he could reach over the seathey did anything bad to us in Europe.”Kaci Jo has other ideas, saying: “I want the BFG [Big Friendly Giant, not to be confused with the ERG] in charge because he is big and he can just go and get them and shout at themthey do anything  wrong in Brussels.”This last comment baffles some of the others. “What’s Brussels ” two of them ask. Oliver reckons he knows. “It’s where Brussels sprouts for Christmas are made,” he says.Marnie is slightly off-target, saying: “Brussels  I think it’s in Germany.”Cyrus adds: “I think everybody there is green and eats sprouts and the fields are made of ­toothbrushes.”But the group seem less clued up about the signicance of March  — the day we are due to leave the EU. Looking confused, Clover asks: “Is it April Fool’s Day  Is it Easter ”James tries: “Is it a big day of ­celebrations ”Cyrus says: “It’s the day Brexit ends, I think. Then we won’t be able to go on holiday but we’ll still be able to go to Harry Potter World and Center Parcs.”Perhaps a little optimistically, ­Clover asks: “Will it be the day everyone starts smiling again ”Cyrus adds: “I think everything will be more expensive, except food that’s homegrown, because we can get that for free. All we have to do is get it ­delivered to the shops, then the shops will wash it and we’ll have food.“I’m going to plant some oranges and lemons. It might be quite fun.”With the PM facing one of the trickiest spells of her career next week, at least she’s now got some fresh insight into the issues ahead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and then leave without one.The senior figures call on the PM to ask EU leaders to free Britain from a never-ending Irish backstop.If they refuse, Mrs May must “have the confidence to leave on WTO terms” on March  as the only way to stay true to her election manesto last year.Their explosive intervention comes as the PM also today declares there are just  hours left to save Brexit ahead of the landmark Commons showdown over it tomorrow night.A reversal of the referendum decision rather than no deal is now the most likely outcomeher orce agreement with Brussels falls, Mrs May will insist.As British politics enters a momentous week, academics predicted her almost certain defeat will trigger the biggest political crisis since World War Two.Ahead of it yesterday as the tension ratcheted upIt only deepens the PM’s appalling dilemma and will now see a serious split in the Tory party, whatever she does.If, as all expect, her deal is heavily torpedoed by the Commons, Mrs May must either go for no deal and alienate Tory moderates, or soften Brexit with Labours help and lose the support of the Leavers.In a further blow for Mrs May, The Sun can also reveal the big beasts’ demand is backed by the DUP.The Ulster unionist party chief will share a  with Mr Davis and Mr Raab tomorrow to spell out their demands to the EU in greater detail.In the letter, leaked to The Sun, the Brexiteers write: “We urge colleagues to look beyond the day-to-day news cycle, to consider the long-run future of our country, and to vote against this agreement.“By voting down this flawed Withdrawal Agreement we can encourage the EU to renegotiate and take out backstop or all out a unilateral right to leave it.“The EU will need to remove the most problematic parts, notably the backstop, or provide a method by which the UK has the unilateral right to leave it.“In the event that the EU is unwilling to commit to this, then we can and must fulfil the democratic wishes of the people of the UK.“That is why,it is the only way forward, we must have the confidence to be ready to leave on WTO terms.”The Brexiteers admit in the letter that leaving without any deal would cause economic pain – which they dub “some short-term inconvenience and disruption”.But they insist “the much greater risks” are to agree to be locked into “a very bad deal” that enforces a customs union on the UK for as long as the backstop lasts.As Westminster braced itself for a historic week, the almost sure defeat of Mrs May’s deal will spark the biggest political crisis since World War Two, academics predicted.Renowned historian Lord Hennessy said British politics will enter “a multiple crisis” over what to do about Brexit, the country’s unwritten constitution, Westminster’s two party system and voters’ faith in politics in general.Peter Hennessy added: “All of that adds up to a crisis with a capital C”.The PM will deliver a speech today in a Labour-voting town that also strongly backed Brexit, in a bid to ram home her point to wavering Labour MPs.Sounding the alarm about Remain MPs plotting to keep the UK in the EU with Speaker John Bercow’s help, the PM will tell factory workers in the Midlands: “As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so.”She will issue her strongest attack yet on MPs wanting to reverse Brexit, saying: “I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy.“Whatwe found ourselves in a situation where Parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote “People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm.”Mrs May won a small boost last night as four wavering Tory MPs declared they would voting for the PM’s deal – Sir Edward Leigh, Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown, Caroline Johnson and Andrew Murrison.But an honours controversy surrounded veteran Eurosceptic Sir Edward’s decision, as it came just two weeks after he was made a Privy Counsellor.Another Leave-backing Labour MP, John Mann, also pledged to support it but admitted that very few of his colleagues planned to do the same, and he’d be surprised “surprisedit’s anything like enough to get this deal through”.Projections still put Mrs May on course for a catastrophic defeat by around  votes – the biggest for a Goverment on record.A raft of senior Tories began to public with alternative courses of action to end the crisis.The most controversial came from pro-EU rebel leader and former Attorney General Dominic Grieve.Mr Grieve – who was also accused of plotting with Speaker John Bercow to reverse Brexit - revealed he is among a cross party group of MPs and peers to have now drawn up a new bill that would bring in a second EU referendum.Working alongside Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, the former Cabinet minister dubbed it “an escape hatch” for Mrs May to end the deadlock.Sir Vince also claimed a Commons bid to soften or reverse Brexit by handing power to MPs was indeed underway, and he was even “talking to Cabinet ministers” about joining it, adding: “It’s not a conspiracy, but it’s clearly happening”.But he and other plotters were rounded on by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who warned them it would be a “huge mistake” to kneecap the Government by changing the Commons rules to allow any MP to pass laws.Former Tory PM John Major stepped up his call for Mrs May to pause Brexit by revoking the Article  departure process for now.A “new process” of national consultation is now required, the ex-party leader argued, to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit.But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay signalled what was likely to be No’s Plan B by suggesting Mrs May will call a second vote on her deal after some tweaks.He told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show strongly suspects the Commons will end up voting for “something along the lines” of the current deal.It was also reported yesterday that the EU assurances on the deal – which could come today - will fall signicantly short of Tory MPs’ demands.Letters from Brussels bosses will pledge their “firm determination” to end the backstop by January , but without any commitment to do it.There is also expected to be a promise to expedite trade talks so a deal can be in place as quickly as possible, limiting theof any backstop or its need at all.But Tory hardline Brexiteer Mark Francois dubbed them “meaningless”, adding: “A love letter doesn’t change the terms of the treaty”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos. Everywhere.I do hope Olivia wins Best Actress for The Favourite at the Academy Awards. When she has an Oscar, fewer people will be able to afford her.LOOKING just like one of the “gilets jaunes” – yellow vests – who rampage up and down the Champs-Elysees every weekend, Bella Hadid wears a hi-vis sleeveless jacket.Apparently, Bella’s yellow vest cost £. She should protest about that.IT was a relief to hear from Olivia Newton-John that she is not at death’s door as has ly been reported, but is alive, kicking and feeling good.Apparently, the confusion arose when it started getting about that the star of Grease had gone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs are deciding whether to accept or reject the -page Brexit deal the UK has signed with Brussels. Its widely expected the deal will be voted down, which raises the question of what happens next. Despite Westminster war-gaming obsessively for months, no one really knows how it will pan out. However, there are some things we know will happen, some that could well happen, and some outside choices. Heres what we know.  MPs are holding a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal from pm on Tuesday  January in the House of Commons. It comes after five days of debate, closed by a speech from Theresa May herself. The vote will be after pm, and could be some hours later, because amendments have to be voted on first. What does the Brexit meaningful vote mean   MPs are deciding whether to approve a Brexit withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU. The deal ensures there is no clf-edge on March  by carrying on EU rules in a transition period to December . It also commits the UK to paying a poundbillion orce bill infor guaranteeing we wont be locked out of EU arrangements. However, there is still no solution to avoid customs checks between Northern Irelandand the Republicafter . So the deal includes a backstop clause that,theres still no solution by , will trap the UK under EU customs rules. This will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world.  Probably not. More than  Tory MPs, and the Tories  DUP allies, said before Christmas they would vote against the deal. Because of this, the deal was delayed in order to win more concessions from the EU. Mrs May promised MPs a veto on kicking in the backstop, and said it wouldnt last more than a year, despite her not really having the authority to promise this. But most MPs refused to change their mind because the EU refused to reopen the actual deal. Instead Brussels only gave assurances around the deal that critics said werent enough. Less than  hours before the vote, only three Tory MPs had publicly changed their minds. Predictions days before the vote suggest she is on course for a defeat by well over  votes - which would be the biggest defeat of a government in the Commons for  years.   What happens nextTheresa May loses the Brexit vote  Some or all of these options will happenTheresa May loses the Brexit vote. No Deal planning will be ramped up - and ministers will quit  Billions of pounds have already been spent on No Deal planning - and you can expect billions more. This includes turning the M motorway into a lorry park and spending poundmillion to boost ferry capacity across the Channel. A chunk of Acts of Parliament, plus more than  secondary emergency laws, will need to be rushed through Parliament. Thousands of extra border officers and Home Office officials are being hired to deal with extra paperwork. Several Tory ministers are expected to quit the governmentNo Deal Brexit starts looking inevitable. They are said to include Business Secretary Greg Clark and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, along with other more junior colleagues.  The Prime Minister is expected to make a statement on the nightshe loses the vote. Her spokesman insisted she would move quickly and provide certainty on the way forwardthe vote is lost. By law she will be forced to come back to Parliament with a formal Plan B within three sitting days - so on Monday  January. She must make a statement on the governments next steps. After another seven sitting days - so by Thursday  January - MPs get a vote on those next steps. However, the vote may not actually have any legal effect. The government has held its cards close to its chest about what that Plan B might be. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested it would be along the lines of Plan A. Labour is set to trigger a no confidence vote  Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will force a no confidence vote in the government soon after a defeat on January . Shadow Cabinet ministers said it would come immediately, but sources close to Jeremy Corbyn were more coy about the timing. There is a huge hurdle to Labour winning a no confidence vote. The DUP - whose  MPs are crucial to victory for both sides - has said it wont back a no-confidence vote unless the Brexit deal passes. But Labour are intending a no confidence voteit fails. So the best Labour can hope for might be for the DUP to abstain - in other words, not to back either side. If Labour does win a no confidence vote, it triggers a -day countdown clock. Andno one can command a Commons majority within  days... We could have a snap general election  A general election is triggered automaticallyno party can win the Commons confidence within two weeks. That could throw us into a campaign and vote on March  at the earliest - just weeks before we leave the EU. A new government would open up a whole new flowchart of possibilities, which we wont get into properly here. If Labour takes power, Jeremy Corbyn says he wants to renegotiate a better deal with the EU - which would require delaying the March  date of Brexit. However, he could be out-voted on that policy - because Labours election manesto will be finalised by committee once an election is called. That means, somewhat oddly, that Labour doesnt actually have a firm Brexit policy yet for the general election its trying to call.  Pretty much the only thing MPs agree on is they dont want a No Deal Brexit. So expect them to pull out every trickin the book to try and block it in Parliament. Government minister Chris Heaton-Harris insisted there isnt a way to block No Deal. And thats true in the sense that No Deal is the default option, written into law. But since then Downing Street have conceded MPs could effectively seize control of the Commons, by upturning the age-old precedent that the government decides what is debated on what day. If that decision is passed to MPs, it opens up a whole wealth of possible changes to Brexit - and allows MPs to put forward a Plan B without government permission . It already looks like it could be going that way. MPs won an amendment that will force the government to seek approval for No Deal spending, one of two defeats to the government the week before the vote.  If Theresa May faces undeniable pressure from within, or MPs, or theres a new leader, there could be a new option for Brexit. Ones that have been mentioned include the much-discussed Norway option, staying in the European Economic Area or EFTA. Remainers are largely in favour but Brexiteers say it would tie our hands and keep us bound to the EU. It would also prevent the UK halting free movement. ... And Remain MPs will push for a second EU referendum  Remain-backers have already been pushing for a second EU referendum, and those calls will only grow. There is no majority for it in the House of Commons yet. But Jeremy Corbyn is facing pressure to back it from more of his members in the Labour Party. He has promised to leave it as an option on the table - in his view, a last resort -the deal is voted down. However, the exact path to a second referendum still isnt clear. And most say it couldnt be arranged in time before March . The date of Brexit could be delayed - or cancelled  Britain could extend the  March date of Brexit -the EU agrees to as well. There would need to be a concrete reason to do this, and itd probably be a short extension. Also, the EU is holding its Parliamentary elections at the end of May, which would get in the way - badly. Alternatively, Brexit can be cancelled without the EUs permission by revoking our notication to leave under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. But while this is legally possible, dont expect it to happen under a Tory government any time soon. Ex-PM Sir John Major has urged Britain to do this in order to provide the time for a second referendum on EU membership. Theresa May might force MPs to vote again and again  Theresa May previously refused to rule out holding the vote on her Brexit deal again and again and againshe loses. She even refused to rule out holding the vote  times. That is despite her warning a second referendum on Brexit would damage trust in democracy. Technically there is nothing in law to stop her putting similar questions to Parliament to get the right answer. But MPs warned it would be a breach of vital parliamentary convention. Theresa May could resign - and force a Tory leadership race  She cant be challenged internally as Tory leader again until December , because she won a no confidence vote and got a years grace. But Theresa May could, in theory, be forced to quit by the men in grey suits of her Cabinet. That would spark a Conservative Party leadership contest. In this case, a new leader would take perhaps a month or two to choose. First MPs would narrow the candidates down to two then the , or so Tory members would vote between the final picks. The winner would become Prime Minister, without needing to call a general election, and could take Brexit in a dramatically dferent direction. Andnone of that comes to anything  We leave on  March  with no deal.

Mr Oaten dramatically quit frontline politics after it was revealed he had been having group encounters with male escorts. The then married father and potential candidate for the Liberal Democrat leadership said at the time the affair was an “error of judgement”. Speaking to BBC Radio  Live’s Emma Barnett, Mr Oaten said: “I’m gay now and Im comfortable with being gay and I’m clear about my sexuality. “I haven’t actually said it until now in an interview.”   The former politician, who lives with his male partner added: “It’s something which is dficult for me to say.” Mr Oaten said the working environment at Westminster which drove him to seek out sex workers was “a horrid culture, and I believe it’s still the same”. He said: “You are in an environment where you can buy drink really cheap, you are in an environment where you are away from home and your family, and you are in this kind of bubble where you are able to get away with anything you want. “You are conscious and aware of colleagues having affairs. “It is a climate where people call you ‘Sir’. “I would almost describe Westminster as this seedy, bullying men’s club.” In  UK politics was hit by a series of revelations of inappropriate behaviour by MPs and those who work for them and with them. A report by Dame Laura Cox revealed more than  parliamentary staffers claimed to have been groped and propositioned by male MPs “And you know, you start off coming into Westminster thinking ‘I’m not like this’, and I’m absolutely convinced that many people with good intentions end up being part of this rather nasty atmosphere around Westminster. “And, it does have an impact on your le, on you and your marriage. I wasn’t strong enough to resist that.” Mr Oaten said his family and friends had been very supportive. “It’s something my friends have known about now, my girls know about, and my mum – those key people – but it’s only been in the last year, year-and-a-half. I’ve got a partner, we live together. I have a group of great gay friends. I can be who I am now.

In December, Carly Ann Harris was found not guilty of murder as a jury ed a special verdict after hearing that psychiatrists - appearing for both the prosecution and defence - agreed the mum was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Harris was sentenced at Newport Crown Court to a hospital order without limit of time - this means she cannot be found guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. But her sister thinks justice has not been served and believes Harris should be locked up.The verdict came after a court heard Harris believed she was a fallen angel and had to sacrice her daughter to prove her faith to God. The -year-old told a doctor she felt very calm and had done the right thing after killing Amelia Brooke Harris at her home in Rhondda, South Wales, on June  this year, jurors were told. Now Carly Harris own family has described her as devil like - and they think she should have a retrial.   They have claimed there is new evidence and are trying to raise money for the case to be re-examined.Harris sister, Tfany Wright, told the Daily Star on Sunday: Were determined to get justice for Amelia - we need to get her story out there.We think Carly should be in jail. I never thought shed be capable of this and she should have received a le sentence. The family has even started a new hashtag #JusticeForAmelia and said Carlys actions were so evil they were devil-like.  Tfany also recalled the horric phone call she received telling her what had happened.She said: I will never forget receiving that phone call. It was about pm in the evening and Carly rang.She told me Ive killed Amelia. Carly said she wishes shed given Amelia to me. I think she knew what she was going to do.I pleaded with her and asked Please tell me youve not done anything to that baby  I was hoping she was just unwell but then she said shed drowned her, and burned her.Ive spoken to my sister since and every time I think about that night, my stomach flips and I feel sick. Tfanys husband, Mathew Wright added: Her daughter is lying six feet under in a cold box, while shes being treated softly in a warm room, having takeaways each weekend and her own en-suite. She should be serving a le-sentence in prison - every day we suffer this - and are livid.During the two-day trial, jurors were told there was no dispute that Harris killed her daughter or about the events leading up to the incident. Amelias teenage brother found her body, wrapped in a sheet, on a table in their garden.Carly Ann Harris denied both murder and manslaughter. Tfany thinks the insanity verdict means justice has not been served and thinks only a retrial will help her nephews come to terms with what happened.The sister has previously spoken about Harris as a teenage rebel who became wild in the years before she drowned her four-year-old daughter. Tfany said her sister was a bible-loving young girl until she went off the rails and began dabbling in drink and drugs.

Furious Paul Dawson was dumbfounded when officers knocked on his Stockton home askingit was true that he feeds his five-day-old son, Ben, the spicy sauce. The bizarre incident stemmed from a Facebook post Paul had written on Sunday when eating at TGI Fridays in Stockton-on-Tees with his family. The -year-old said: My baby son was born on New Years Day and myself and my partner Lorencia went for something to eat.   Lorencia was breast-feeding Ben and I was eating hot wings. She was wanting to eat her food so askedI could hold him while she ate. Id wiped my hands on a napkin, as you do, and was holding him. He wasnt too happy at not feeding anymore so I put my knuckle in his mouth to try and pacy him - completely forgetting about what Id eaten. Ben made a funny face and that was that.  Paul then put a status on Facebook saying: Apparently five-day-old babies dont like it when their dads put their fingers in their mouths after eating hot wings. Unintentionally by the way. Lol. But a couple of days later, on Tuesday, the police knocked on his door. The barber shop owner added I opened the door and asked what was up. They replied you dont know then  and I said I didnt have a clue.   Thats when they told me that I had apparently been feeding my son hot sauce. I just said are you taking the p*** , mate  Annoyed and upset that someone had reported him, Paul left it up to his partner to explain the situation to the officers. He said: I was actually quite tearful that someone had called the police. My girlfriend then asked the officerstheyd even read the Facebook post. They hadnt, so they were shown it and they just looked embarrassed. They apologised and admitted that they shouldnt have been called and then left. I cant believe, with our stretched police force, they were sent out without looking into it properly. It was absolutely disgusting, it just tarnished the whole Christmas season. A Cleveland Police spokesman said: “Police received a call from a member of the public regarding concern for the welfare of a baby on Tuesday  January. “As a result, two officers were deployed to an address in Stockton to speak with the parents of the baby to understand the circumstances of the report. “Officers were satisfied that the baby was safe and well and there were no further enquiries carried out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fortnite playing children are helping","story":"NewsFortnite playing children are helping to fuel organised crimeCriminals are using black markets on the dark web to launder money through the popular video games in-game currency, V-bucksShareCommentsByFred Nathan:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsCybercriminals are laundering money on the dark web using V-Bucks, Fortnite’s in-game currency\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChildren who play popular video game Fortnite are helping to fuel organised crime, an investigation has claimed. Black markets online are being used to launder money through the video games in-game currency, V-bucks, it is alleged. The online shooting game is popular with the  million people who play it worldwide, because it is free to play - but that has also made it an easy target for cyber-criminals, according to The Independent . Credit card details are being stolen and used to buy V-bucks from the official Fortnite store, which are then sold onto players at a discounted rate, netting a profit for the criminals. These criminals accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash, two cryptocurrencies which are hard for law enforcement to track down - making them harder to be caught.   As well as V-bucks being sold in bulk on the dark web - corners of the internet only accessible with special software - as well as on social media s such as Instagram and Twitter . Security company Sixgill went undercover and found operations in Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and English. A Sixgill analyst told the Independent: “Criminals are executing carding fraud and getting money in and out of the Fortnite system with relative impunity.   Threat actors [a malicious person or entity]are scoffing at Epic Games’ weak security measures, saying that the company doesn’t seem to care about players defrauding the system and purchasing discounted V-bucks. This directly touches on the ability of threat actors to launder money through the game.   The analyst said that while completely stopping such criminal activity is extremely dficult, steps could be taken to mitigate the phenomenon. These might include identying players with large stockpiles of V-bucks, and sharing data with the authorities. One dark web seller claims to offer V-Bucks at a discounted rate as a form of charity.  On the product description, they wrote: I’m f****** rich as f***. Now it’s time to give back to the deep web at a massive discounted rate.

So, as the Daily Mirror newspaper launches our fantastic new Day--Day Puzzle which could see you win a whopping pound, we take a look back at our lelong obsessions with testing our little grey cells...  The first puzzles emerged in  BC when labyrinth drawings became popular in Ancient Greece and Egypt. The images, as well as being challenging on the mind, held religious and spiritual signicance in the ancient culture. The word ‘quiz’ is believed to have been first coined by Irish theatre owner Richard Daly, who in  bet his friends that within  hours he could make a nonsense word be spoken throughout Dublin.He then got his employees to write the word ‘QUIZ’ in chalk on doors, windows and walls throughout Dublin, and it soon became the talk of the town. Palindromes - a phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards - were first used by the Greeks, then the Romans, in the first century AD. The phrase ‘nipsom anomemata me monan opsin’ appeared on fountains during the classical period of Greek history, meaning ‘wash the sin as well as the face’. The Roman’s favourite was “In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni” or “we enter the circle after dark and are consumed by fire”. The first ever published crossword puzzle appeared in the Sunday New York World on December , , devised by Liverpudlian Arthur Wynne. First called a word-cross, the name later evolved into cross-word, before the hyphen was dropped. The puzzle was an immediate success and became a weekly feature, although it remained the only newspaper to run them until .Although Scrabble was invented in , the first wordsearch puzzle didn’t appear until . It was created by Normal Gibat and published in a small classied-listings newspaper called the Selenby Digest in Norman, Oklahoma. In , people playing Foldit, an online puzzle game about protein folding, resolved the structure of an enzyme that causes an Aids-like disease in moneys. Researchers had been working on the problem for  years. The gamers solved it in three weeks. A puzzle book called Masquerade sparked a national craze in the UK in , as it continued clues in paintings and verse that would lead to the physical location of an -carat Golden Hare. The search for the hare became a national obsession, with more than a million copies sold and lawns dug up around the country. But the search ended in scandal after the man who eventually found it was revealed to have had contact with the author. In , by a huge coincidence, a crossword puzzle was printed with answers all containing D-Day operation code names, which sent MI- into a panic thinking their invasion plans had been discovered. In  a -year-old waiter called Antal Gyula was found in a washroom in Budapest with gunshot wounds through his chest and head. Police found a suicide note in the form of a crossword puzzle, which Gyula said would reveal the exact reasons for his suicide, and “the names of the people interested”.

Theresa May’s fatally flawed plan that will make Britain poorer and weaker deserves to be killed off tomorrow, when the PM will be rightly hammered in the House of Commons vote she never wanted. Yet this is not the end of the beginning – never mind the beginning of the end – of a poisonous national crisis created by fibbers and fuelled by porkies. Truth is the first casualty when fanatical Brextremists invent myths to create a phony land at the centre of a new empire.  Mays Brexit argument doesnt wash as Scots knew what we were voting for  For all May’s plastic Churchillian rhetoric, she is a gutless appeaser. The leader of the first Government in history to be found in contempt of Parliament has a cheek to be popping up in a factory in Stoke-on-Trent today to pose as the most unlikely champion of democracy. She deserves to be defeated and ousted for trying to appease Tory headbangers who continue to lie about Britain’s past, present and future. May knows that reforming and remaining in Europe is the best deal, and nothing has changed when she refuses to declare publicly that she would vote to leave the EU in another referendum. And even for an unprincipled Minister, cabinet incompetent Chris Grayling hit a new low by appeasing Far Right extremist thugs who are manipulating Brexit as a vehicle for violent racism. May is wasting her timeshe believes that Labour collaborators will save her tomorrow, when no more than  opposition MPs are expected to back the May mess. Ingrained Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn vows to move fast after the Prime Minister’s defeat to table a formal no-confidence motion in the Tories. Yet the Labour leader will face intensive party pressure to support calls for a people’s vote , as they will, the Tories resist the general election they would lose. Labour is split too, as meetings of Corbyn’s team last week underlined – with Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer heading calls for a shyreferendum, and party chair Ian Lavery leading the resistance. Admittedly, there is no easy way forward from a hazy verdict achieved by deceit and illegality in a previous Parliament’s dishonest referendum. But  container-loads of toys put aside by The Entertainer chain tell us Brexit isn’t fun and games.

I know Garry, I knew there was no point saying no - it was happening. He grabbed me by the top knot, pushed me on to the knees and pulled me to the kitchen like a dog and made me bark. I was on my knees and he was pulling my hair. He asked where I kept the scissors and I said I didnt have any. He said, okay, itll need to be a kitchen kne, then. He grabbed me by the hair and hacked my hair off. There was no point in me fighting back, I thought he was going to kill me. I thought I was going to be found dead in the morning.  The court heard that during the attack, she managed to make a run for her front door and got out of the internal front door but got stuck in the porch - before being pulled back in by McNeill and subjected to more blows. Miss Dodds said McNeill later went to bed and fell asleep - managing to convince him while he was half asleep to give her back her phone.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c386996996ee2.68324658.jpg ","title":"dundee charity shop selling clothes designed by oasis star liam gallagher","story":"A Dundee charity shop is setting up a Wonderwall of jackets after receiving a delivery of Liam Gallagher-designed clothing.Budding Rock ‘n’ Roll Stars will need to make their way to Shelter on Perth Road at Supersonic speed after the shop was gted half a dozen mint-condition Pretty Green coats and jackets.The generous donation was handed in to the store by an anonymous donor.The jackets usually retail at between £-£ and will help raise much-needed funds for the homeless charity.The clothes are expected to sell quickly, due to their Oasis connection and affordability.John Sinclair, Shelter Scotland area manager, said: “We are really grateful to the person who has donated these high-quality items which are in perfect condition.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr.

Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys.

The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided.

It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"29-year-old-locked-up-after-breaching-borders-ban-on-hogmanay","story":"A MAN who is banned from entering the Scottish Borders was found by police during a disturbance in Hawick on Hogmanay.Twenty nine year old Shaun Grieve appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court and pleaded guilty to breaching the court order by being in Kenilworth Avenue on Monday.But Grieve, who now lives at Shakespeare Way, Blackburn, Lancashire, denied repeatedly contacting Nicola McWatters at her home in Galalaw Road, Hawick, on December  in an alleged breach of another court order.Defence lawyer Ross Dow said his client had been back in Hawick over the New year period as his grandfather had suffered a stroke.But Sherf Derrick McIntyre noted Grieves previous convictions and that number of breaches of bail and refused a motion for bail.Grieve was remanded in custody until the trial date of February .Sentence was deferred for the offence of entering the Borders on Hogmanay until the outcome of the trial."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-swimming-pool-latest-to-close-due-to-technical-issues","story":"SWIMMERS in Galashiels have faced a high and dry start to the new year.The towns pool was closed due to mechanical problems on Monday, December .And despite repairs being carried out during the planned holiday closure staff were unable to open the doors again on Thursday or Friday.A spokeswoman for operators Live Borders said: \"Following improvement yesterday , we are hopeful of getting the temperature up to suitable level and reopening over the weekend.\"We apologise for any inconvenience this closure may have caused.\"This latest closure comes just days after Selkirk Swimming Pool was closed for a week in the run up to Christmas for similar technical problems.We reported last month how during   attendances at swimming pools, gyms and other sports facilities across the region had fallen year-on-year in   by more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"good-behaviour-order-for-bowden-man-after-new-year-bust-up","story":"A BOWDEN man involved in a New Years Day bust-up with his partner has been ordered to be of good behaviour for the next three months.Graeme Reid pleaded guilty to shouting and swearing during the incident.The -year-old also admitted threatening his partner with violence and repeatedly striking the door of a house in Dick Road.The case will recall at Selkirk Sherf Court on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"organisers-hope-to-rekindle-peebles-torchlight-procession","story":"ORGANISERS of Peebles Hogmanay Torchlight Procession are hopeful the spectacle willthis year ndash after cancelling the  event to give volunteers a break.Event director Neil Dalgleish told us: ldquoWe have had a full on year and we wanted to give volunteers a deserved break at the new year with their families.ldquoA huge amount of work goes into organising the event and we will have to start preparing now for .The procession has taken place in the town since .

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering.

Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the proposals on Tuesday, with the developers hoping to submit a planning application with East Lothian Council in the spring.The site, between the East Coast Mainline, Beveridge Row and the Lochend Campus of the townrsquos primary school, was earmarked for development in East Lothian Councilrsquos Local Development Plan .Currently, the plans are still at an early stage, with approximately  houses earmarked for the .-hectare site.The proposed development, known as Hallhill North, would also include an area designated for a recreation sports pitch for community use in close proximity to the primary school.Options for renewable energy provision are being considered for the site.The LDP notes: ldquoAny development here is subject to the mitigation of any development related impacts, including on a proportionate basis for any cumulative impacts with other proposals including on the transport network and on education and community facilities as appropriate.Ahead of a public exhibition, which will be held at the townrsquos Hallhill Sports Centre from pm to .pm on Tuesday, Ken Ross, from Hallhill Developments Ltd, noted the impact the Hallhill development had made in the last  years.Economist Tony Mackay produced an economic impact assessment in  which concluded that existing and future Hallhill developments will contribute nearly pound million annually to the East Lothian economy and will generate more than  jobs.Mr Ross said: ldquoHallhill North will not only involve much-needed housing, including affordable housing, but will also include provision for a sports pitch for community use.Jacquie Bell, Dunbar Community Council secretary, said: ldquoThere is not much we can do about the go-ahead outline, I think what we can try to influence is the detail of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans for the site are expected to be revealed at the consultation event.Ward councillor Norman Hampshire said ldquoone or two issues still needed to be dealt with, including the potential road layout, as well as financial contributions to schools."},{"url":null,"title":"public-thanked-for-huge-support-for-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"Customers at the countyrsquos Tesco stores did their bit to help the East Lothian Foodbank during a three-day collection late last year.Once again, it proved a great success, with the Tranent-based charity collecting , kilogrammes of non-perishable food over the three days, compared to , kilogramme in .The foodbank was helped at the three stores by the newly-acclaimed volunteer team of the year award winners, volunteers of East Lothian Foodbank and by ious Rotary clubs in the county, from Dunbar, Haddington, Tranent and Musselburgh, as well as Inner Wheel and Police Scotlandrsquos youth volunteers.Peter Dicker, East Lothian Foodbank manager, said: ldquoOnce again we have been astounded by the generosity of people in East Lothian with the total collected at the Tesco stores.ldquoAs well as people giving us the food, we must make a special mention of the people who voluntarily give their time to help us with the collection.ldquoAn extra special mention must go to Iain Hastie and his team at Wood Pellets East Lothian for driving round the three stores and collecting all the donations and delivering them to the foodbank in Tranent.ldquoWe would also like to thank Martin Whitfield MP and Iain Gray MSP for their continued support at Musselburgh and Haddington helping with the collections.ldquoWe must also thank the people and organisations who continue to deliver donations to us so generously.Meanwhile, the charity has also benefited from generous visitors to enjoyleisurersquos sports facilities across the county.enjoyleisure ran a lsquoRemember, Remember the Foodbank this Novemberrsquo campaign.In total, the donations collected across enjoyleisurersquos six sports centres amounted to kg, which equates to about  meals.Bill Axon, enjoyleisure general manager, said: ldquoAs a community organisation, we wanted to show our support to this invaluable local initiative and assist those who are in need of its services.ldquoWe are incredibly grateful to our customers and staff who contributed donations.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake.

A Healthier Future, which closes on January .The plans could see Scotland become the first country in the world to pass legislation banning multi-buy promotions on unhealthy foods as part of efforts to tackle obesity. Proposals also include capping portion sizes in restaurants and takeaways, mandatory calorie information on menus and extending the sugar tax to milky drinks like milkshakes and hot chocolates which contain less than % milk.In its response to the consultation, BMA Scotland said restrictions on price promotions \"should be comprehensive and not allow exceptions\", for example cracking down on buy-one-get-one-free deals but failing to target items such as multipacks of crisps and confectionary which are \"designed to promote greater consumption\".It added: \"Consideration should also be given to banning the use of packaging to promote a productrsquos lsquohealthierrsquo nutritional content when one unhealthy nutrient has simply been replaced by another. For example it is not uncommon for products to prominently claim to be reduced or low fat when in reality this has been achieved by signicantly increasing a productrsquos sugar content. This risks misleading consumers who are trying to take a healthier approach to their purchases.\"It comes after retail and food industry representatives criticised the proposals as \"badly thought through and unenforceable.The Food and Drink Federation Scotland said there was \"no evidence of the effectiveness of these measures in tackling obesity\", and stressed that the \"promotion to adults of all foods is a fundamental commercial freedom\".It added that one of its members - an unnamed ldquoiconic Scottish brand - could lose pound million in sales as a direct result of such measures, which it said would ldquolikely result in major redundancies.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the Scottish Retail Consortium said there was a \"dearth of detail over the exact definition of products, categories, and store areas\" and argued that there was no evidence to show that price promotions \"encourage over-consumption\".Dr Lewis Morrison, chair of BMA Scotland, said obesity was placing a \"massive burden\" on the NHS and \"bold\" action was needed.Dr Morrison said: ldquoSales promotions are routinely deployed by retailers to encourage consumers to purchase products and are disproportionately used to promote unhealthy food and drink. Their eye-catching nature also contributes to in-store environments that favour unhealthy dietary behaviour by drawing additional attention to such products.ldquoOn this basis it is clear that mandatory and comprehensive action is needed to help improve diets and reduce consumption of unhealthy products.

Such a deal can still be negotiated, but not by the end of March.ldquoHaving wasted so much time on the Withdrawal Agreement, leaving on WTO terms is now the only way to break free fully and build a more prosperous, independent future."},{"url":null,"title":"liam-fox-urged-to-clarify-uks-post-brexit-relationship-with-switzerland","story":"SNP MP Angus MacNeil accused the International Trade Secretary of making \"blithe assurances of progress\" on the transition of a trade agreement between the two countries.Last month, the Government announced that it had approved an agreement with the Swiss Federal Council allowing businesses to continue trading freely after Brexit.The agreement replicates the existing EU-Switzerland arrangements \"as far as possible\" and will come into effect at the end of the implementation period in January  - or on March Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.In a letter to Dr Fox, Mr MacNeil called for clarity on which aspects of the current relationship are replicated in the text and asked whether it would enable UK-based firms to continue trading into Switzerland on the \"same basis as they do currently\".Commenting on the letter to Dr Fox, Mr MacNeil said: \"Switzerlands access to the single market requires it to accept both freedom of movement and a signicant proportion of EU law.\"It is based not only on a trade agreement eliminating tarfs but also on a myriad of other trade-related agreements.

Salaries are determined by a tripartite body including the Government, council representatives and unions.The current offer, tabled the local authorities, would give teachers earning up to pound, a % rise in three consecutive years.A second strand includes an overhaul of the pay scale which,accepted, could add another % to the salaries of some teachers this year.However, the Educational Institute of Scotland , which represents teachers, rejected the offer and is moving towards a strike ballot.Swinney has now suggested a change to the pay scale element that would result in a % uplt from this month.

I think how you frame it mentally is a big key to success.Martine explained that thinking about his own resolutions in a dferent way helped him to achieve a goal he set almost two decades ago.He said: ldquoI gave up drinking, more or less entirely. I didnrsquot have a problem or anything, other than being Scottish, I just thought I wanted to stop so I gave up in  and I found it was easy.ldquoThe way I managed it was to think about what I wanted to do, rather than what I donrsquot want to do.ldquoI knew I wanted to wake up in the morning feeling fresh and alert, and I knew that on a Sunday morning with a hangover that would be the opposite. The way I framed it was in terms of waking up feeling good, and I knew that not having alcohol in my system would help that process.Despite many peoplersquos resolutions staying the same over the past few decades, the way people think about them has moved towards a more negative mindset, according to Martin. It mirrors scientic findings which have shown people have a negative brain bias, and negative thoughts are more easily settled on than positive ones.According to American researcher Dr John Cacioppo, Ph.D, the brain reacts more strongly to negative stimuli, which is thought to be an evolutionary technique to help keep people out of harms way and protect them. Dr Cacioppo suggested the only way to counteract the negative bias is to have frequent, small positive experiences that will help sht the imbalance.Martin said small changes may not only help achieve a more positive outlook on le but could be another way to smash new yearrsquos resolution goals and change them in to lelong habits.The slow and steady approach is particular helpful, he said, when it comes to health-related goals as it gives the body time to adjust.According not a iety of reports. Around % of peoplersquos bew yearsrsquo resolutions are health-related, whileSchemes like Dry January, where people are encouraged to give up all alcohol for a month, or Veganuary, where people eat vegan meals in January, donrsquot help people to change their lestyle or habits in the long term, said Martin.He said: ldquoIf you try and make new yearrsquos resolutions practical and achievable, in small steps it should help you to stick to them, but I know that tends to go against the grain.ldquoWe are seeing more and more things like Veganuary and Dry January that encourage you to do something that you may not be used to, straight away.ldquoItrsquos betteryou just say lsquoIrsquom going to do this for the next few weeks.rsquo And start small. It could be something as small as adding a spoonful of salad to whatever you are eating, to get more nutrition that way.ldquoYou can then start to build that up gradually. Itrsquos better than making these sweeping changes.ldquoWhat you want to achieve is a lelong habit, in most cases. The way people live should be an ongoing continuous thing so they donrsquot have to stop and start, make a new resolution and then lapse.ldquoYou are trying to make a smooth adjustment from one way of living, so itrsquos better to see it as a long sweeping turn of a road.ldquoYou need to ease your way round and not make instant bending changes. Take little steps, keep it moving and I tend to find thatrsquos a much easier route.Along with slow, steady changes and positive thinking, not being too harsh on yourselfyou fail is another vital step to success.ldquoSelf compassion is so important. Martin said.ldquoThat is a really key principal of mindfulness but it is also importantpeople want to achieve their goalsldquoDonrsquot beat yourself up. If you are going on a diet, and you see a caramel wafer and you eat It, donrsquot think lsquooh no Irsquove ruined the diet and eat another  caramel wafers to compensate.ldquoThis happens often, but what people should really be trying to do is be kind to themselves.ldquoEverybody lapses and makes judgement errors and things like that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-snp-mp-to-appear-at-hearing-over-trust-fund","story":"A five-day hearing opens tomorrow in Perth, led by the Law Society, against her and her then-partner Niall Mickel in the defunct firm Hamilton Burns.

I had no interest whatsoever in your man but this man was not the type to make chitchat with a woman.He drew my attention to the low quality of female in the nightclub and expressed sadness and frustration that so many young women were overweight. I suggested that the shape of unknown women might not be any of his business and that it is considered impolite to comment.He told me that I was \"heavy\". \"You need to look after yourself better,\" he said. \"Theres no excuse for young women not to look after themselves and for young women to be overweight.\"A light dawned. In certain circles, this is a tactic called \"negging\" and this hard nonsense is not unusual. The idea is that the man insults his intended in order to tap in to her presumed self-esteem issues and make her work for his attention. Its a classic tactic of the so-called \"pickup artist\" movement, a misogynist subculture with a set of rules for picking up women or, as they style it, \"game\". There are gradients of how odious this is but the lighter elements ndash such as negging ndash are fairly mainstream.I wouldnt be drawn. I laughed, told him I was perfectly happy as I am.He was a relatively short man and not unattractive, obviously took care of his appearance and had a confidence bordering on bullish.\"Why are you here \" he asked me. \"Wouldnt you be happier at home in your kitchen with your children \" He wasnt trying to be a cheeky chappy. He wasnt trying to be a contrarian. He was, quite seriously, asking me the question.Two things kept me on the spot: an ingrained politeness and a desire to confound his beliefs by confronting him with a women who has neither children nor a kitchen anyone would want to pass much time in.\"I dont have children and I also dont want children,\" I told him. He seemed genuinely curious. \"Why not  \"\"Well,\" I said. \"Why would you assume I would \"He had the obvious answer: \"Women are only ever truly happy when they are at home with their children.\" Ah, there. The penny dropped. This guy was a pickup artist of the mens rights activism type.Mens rights activists espouse misogyny as ideology. They believe feminism has oppressed and disadvantaged men, they see no fundamental unfairness of societyrsquos treatment of women.They have hijacked feminist terminology and narrative for their own purposes and use the perceived evils of feminism to explain marital breakdown, romantic inadequacy and workplace failure.Id read so much about these fellows yet one never really believes one will cross paths in real le with the truly odious corners of the internet.Women should be at home in the kitchen with their children, not abroad at night in clubs. Yet who would he huntwe were safely at home  His stance was classic mens rights activism. It is a set of kaleidoscopically contradictory beliefs: that women should be sexually available to any man at any time that women should be despised as sluts that women should keep themselves exclusively for their husbands.Sorry chaps, as women have been told repeatedly, you canrsquot have it all.I wanted to stick around and see what  he had to say. He had much  to say.He point blank refused to entertain the notion that I might be happy being single. This was impossible. Women, he told me, are delusional about being single.\"The only reason you think youre happy being single,\" he said, and Ive had to edit this to take out certain suggestions for how he believed a man might benefit me, \"Is because youve never met a man who knows you, who is your intellectual equal, your emotional equal, who dominates you and who you can submit to.\"Women, he believes, look after themselves better - by which I imagine he means make themselves aesthetically pleasing for men - when they are in a relationship. Single women let themselves go.\"Thats why we have so many young women who are overweight. The rise of the single woman is causing obesity. Women are in their best shape when they are with the right man.\"Briefly, I mulled this over. I have put weight on while being single, thats right. But not due to unhappiness, due to contentment. No longer wanting to conform to a standard ideal of what my younger self believed men wanted was a great release. Besides the bald fact of this man being a dick, he was also a dick who had everything backward.He told me how hed been furious to receive a flyer through his door from a famous weight loss club and had gone as far as to phone up to complain about how the diet method the club uses messes with a womans hormones, forcing her into a weight loss weight gain cycle. Imagine that anger, that need for control.He carried on to tell me how damaged society has become by women who think they can raise children on their own as single mothers. \"People think the blurring of the gender roles is acceptable, its wrong. Men and womens roles should be separate but they need to work together - men providing and women at home.\"And so, you might think, this sounds not unlike being trapped next to an elderly and cantankerous uncle at an event organised by the side of the family youd usually ignore.But this is a relatively young man and these are his firmly held beliefs. The controlled hatred rolling from him was palpable.Receiving this information in a blunt and unemotional way was not easy. This has always been my tactic in a chat up situation. Present as disinterested. Do the rejecting before they reject you, save face at all costs. But this time it wasnt a tactic, I was quite determined to emphasise that I had no interest in him and this was not a chat up situation.Of course, I neednt have worried. How silly to have ever thought so. I was far too old for him. Despite him telling me he was mid s, there was no way this man would look at any woman upwards of .He told me about womens \"biological shelf le\" and how I was inching past it. \"A man,\" he said, \"Can father limitless children but a woman only ovulates  times a year and so she has a biological shelf le - thats a fact. It cant be disputed.\"I wonder how many women are aware of how many times a year they ovulate. This chap had clearly done his reading. I was reaching my limit now. I thought knowing his tricks and his trade I would be relatively immune but this bile was starting to have an impact as I thought of the other, younger women he might have tried it on and my other, younger self who might just have been susceptible.I know myself now, I know what I want and what I believe. But my late teens and my s were a quagmire of uncertainty, my self-esteem an unreliable flibbertigibbet. I would have tried to impress this man. I would have seen his views as a challenge, tried to win him round.And thats what pickup artists rely on, the vulnerability women in a non-feminist society develop by being constantly told they dont and cant fit an ideal of beauty, career success and motherhood.I was trying to tune back into the music, he was hearing the clattering din of misandry.He switched his phaser to our education system, a \"failed disgrace\". \"It is sucking the creativity out of our children,\" he said, as a gaggle of joyous young women squeezed past on their way to the bar, \"And teaching them conformity.\"Its teaching them homosexuality is ok, feminism is ok. The only reason we have feminists and lesbians is that the alpha man is dying out.\"There is no such thing as a lesbian - only a woman who hasnt found an alpha male to submit to.\"That was my limit. There was only so much talk of submission before I admitted defeat and just... walked away. I didnt chide him, I didnt shout at him. I just walked wearily away wondering how many very young women hes manipulated, how much emotional damage hes caused. His anger had left a weight on me no amount of dancing could lt and I carried that weight all the way home.How many others like him are there with this deep rage towards women  This rage, it breeds in the corners of the internet but it is carried into real le by these men with beliefs more common than you might think.I hope any women he encounters does the same: walks away and leaves him in the dark all alone."},{"url":null,"title":"new-project-to-tackle-child-poverty-in-scotland-as-230000-struggle-to-feed-families","story":"New project to tackle child poverty in Scotland as , struggle to feed familiesGillian McCormick founder of the Glasgow North West Food Bank at the Food Bank oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtn Millbrix Avenue inltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Glasgow#s Whiteinch area.Kirsty Anderson Newsquest   Herald and TimesNew project to tackle child poverty in Scotland as , struggle to feed familiesAudrey Flanagan, manager at the Glasgow south east Foodbank, pictured at the fooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtdbank on Butterbiggiltspan classtruncate-full-screengtns rd, Govanhill, Glasgow.

Homework doesnrsquot materialise, sick days just happen to coincide with school trips but itrsquos really because therersquos no money at home to cover to the costs.Already straggling behind, as each school week passes their hopes of catching up with better off classmates slip a little further through their tiny fingers.It is, agrees Andrea Bradley of teachersrsquo union EIS, a desperate picture of education in Scotland today, where one in four children comes from a family gripped by poverty and where arriving in the classroom with rumbling tummies is just one disturbing element of potentially catastrophic shadow blighting thousands of young lives.ldquoItrsquos shocking and alarming for teachers, says Bradley, the unionrsquos assistant secretary. ldquoTeachers tell us they know some children are not eating between leaving school at pm and arriving next day at am.The complex issues facing , Scots children in poverty ndash not all of them living in obviously deprived areas and a signicant number from working families - and a raft of strategies aimed at helping educators to ease their plight, are now to form part of a major project to be delivered to the nationrsquos schools.Currently being devised by the EIS, the countryrsquos largest teaching union, in partnership with the Scottish Government, a pound, two-year project intends to equip educators ndash many from comfortable backgrounds with no personal experience of living in poverty ndash with the skills to spot pupils experiencing hardship in the hope of boosting their prospects and closing the attainment gap.The project, to be launched in schools by summer , will include strategies aimed at supporting pupils which could range from changes in homework tasks to take into account children who may have no internet or even colouring pencils at home, to being aware of costs related to school trips, unorms and events like dress down days which call on children to \"bring a pound\" for charity.A key element of the project will draw on research which highlights the complicated impacts of poverty on families such as mental health issues, and the knock-on implications for childrenrsquos educational achievement which may already have damaged their learning prospects well before they even start school.It is expected to also equip teachers with a broader understanding of how to identy children in the grip of poverty, from looking at their pallor and whether they are particularly lethargic in the classroom, their behaviour, how well their clothes fit and even the snacks they bring ndash or, more often, donrsquot bring ndash to school.It follows recent guidance from the EIS to its members, which suggested avoiding punitive action over issues such as incomplete homework and lack of gym kit which could be explained by dficulties at home.ldquoThere needs to be a real sensitivity in how these issues are handled, stresses Bradley. ldquoWe want the project to have a really strong focus on the all the causes and consequences of poverty, and we want teachers to have that wider societal view of childrens experiences beyond the classroom.ldquoChildren dont come to school as pupils and in isolation of what happens in family le at home and in the community.It comes amid rising concern that Scotlandrsquos children are being hardest hit by benefits restrictions and rising living costs which are leaving even working families struggling to cope.While the Scottish Government has ambitious plans to signicantly reduce poverty and inequality by , independent monitoring suggests the number of children living in poverty in the UK is set to increase to one in three by -, taking numbers back to those last seen in the s.Concerns are already rising over the impact on childrenrsquos physical wellbeing. There were calls last week for a UK Minister for Hunger to tackle malnutrition while recent figures from food bank charity the Trussell Trust showed a % rise in people relying on food parcels between April and September last year, among them over , children.Meanwhile, a Scottish Government report last month showed the gap in educational performance between rich and poor primary school pupils is widening: just  per cent of P children from the most deprived areas met the standard expected in literacy compared with  per cent in the least deprived.All of which comes against a background of an ever-widening skills gap across a range of sectors and demands from employers.According to Professor Jane Callaghan, director of child wellbeing and protection at Stirling University, poverty seeps into and damages many areas of childrenrsquos learning and development.ldquoFood poverty has implicationschildren are under-nourished or poorly nourished there are knock-on effects for brain development, she says. ldquoBut food alone is not going to fix it.She paints a disturbing picture of poverty depriving children of toys and play facilities to develop both emotional and motor skills, and the impact of time-poor parents gripped by depression that saps their ability to support their children even when they want to.ldquoFamilies donrsquot have a lot of money to provide activities during holidays, or good quality play equipment. That has a negative impact because play is one of the most important things for childhood development, she adds.The stress of poverty is also an issue. ldquoIn-work poverty produces precarious circumstances for parents. That has an impact on parenting practices: the more stressed you are, the harder it is to be emotionally responsive to children.Poverty can lead to a lack of aspiration, she continues. ldquoA lot of families in poverty really value education. Butwe donrsquot pay enough attention to poverty and social equality issues, we are just putting a Band-Aid over the problems.EIS equality committee vice-convener Caroline Yates, who has taught children in deprived areas, paints a bleak picture of classroom le for thousands of Scottish pupils.ldquoIf children are hungry, theyrsquore not ready to learn, she says. ldquoTheyrsquoll be very lethargic and canrsquot concentrate. They might say they didnrsquot have time for breakfast and try to cover up whatrsquos going on.ldquoThey wonrsquot have gym equipment or it wonrsquot be the right size because theyrsquove grown. They come to school without a pencil.ldquoChildren from deprived backgrounds come into school already up to  months behind their peers in maths and language skills.She adds: ldquoTeachers donrsquot grudge doing things to help children, but therersquos increasing frustration with a system that allows this to happen to children.Audrey Flanagan, of Glasgow South East Foodbank, sees an increasing number of families calling for support ndash she reckons up % between April and July last year.ldquoTherersquos a poverty of hope among these people, she says. ldquoFamilies are so ground down, they canrsquot lt their heads.ldquoTeachers are not unaware of children who are living in poverty, and itrsquos clear that they want kids to have a good education. But that only way to do that istheir parents have more money.Poverty campaigners have called on the Scottish Government to act to help ease the pressure.ldquoThe Scottish Government could use its budget to bring forward delivery of its new income supplement, says Neil Cowan of the Poverty Alliance. ldquoThis is to be introduced in  but families simply cannot wait until then.ldquoWe know that poverty has a huge impact on educational attainment, and so anything that schools or local authorities can do to reduce the cost of the school day and lsquopoverty-proofrsquo their practice should have a positive impact, he said.And John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group agrees. ldquoTrips, after-school activities, not being able to afford the cost of materials even for core curriculum activities, the cost of home economics and technical materials, all creates real pressure and stress on children and families, he says.ldquoWe know that when families have extra money therersquos increased spending on fruit, vegetables, and books. When we see reduction in income, therersquos a damaging impact on children.The new pound, EIS-led project follows a pound million Scottish Government pledge in its first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan launched in March last year includes a range of measures intended to support low income families.Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ldquoWersquove learned from our work on the Scottish Attainment Challenge that the quality of teaching and learning is the most important factor in raising attainment and reducing the poverty related attainment gap.ldquoThis funding will create two posts to develop training for teachers and head teachers to better understand how we can remove the barriers that poverty can put on a young personrsquos ability to learn, and bring us closer to achieving our goal of closing the attainment gap.MUM of four Gillian McCormick says there are times when the challenges her family face hit her so hard that she canrsquot help but break down and sob.ldquoI actually spent the whole of yesterday in tears, it was absolutely horric, she admits.ldquoMy daughter is going through tests for autism. My son, Mikey, has Downs Syndrome, hersquos in a wheelchair and he canrsquot talk. Itrsquos the most exhausting thing you can imagine.ldquoThey said lsquoYou canrsquot earn pound a week and keep your Carers Allowancersquo, so they took it away.

He had just declared the Conservatives to be the party of work, of \"labour\".\"We are the builders,\" he added, \"and to build, you must build on solid foundations.\"The chancellor did not have new taxpayer cash to pay for all this construction. But he did have pensioners money.His aim: to re-style and refocus  local government pension funds, the future incomes of hundreds of thousands of public-sector workers, in to engines of economic regeneration.Six superfunds, together worth some pound billion, would be big enough to save hundreds of millions in fees and costs and pay for new schools, bridges, homes and prisons.Party loyalists cheered.Less than a year later Osborne was gone, his political career ended by Brexit. Whitehall become engrossed in the complexities of leaving the European Union. And pension funds underwent their own tricky process of pooling and merging.Gradually, though, the funds started to put money in to infrastructure. Local Government minister Rishi Sunak last summer said he wanted the funds to put a th of their investments in to infrastructure. That would be pound billion.Watching the English reforms were Scottish ministers. They, like Osborne, hoped to unleash the power of council pensions on the real economy. Last summer, with little fanfare - and no cheering supporters - the Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay, a former council leader himself, announced an independent consultation on how to do so.Should Scotlands  funds - worth more than pound billion at a recent count - merge in to one  Should they team up to run pooled inidual investment funds, rather like what is happening in England  Or should they simply work more closely together And what,anything, would such reforms do to lure some Scottish pension money out of global financial markets in to real-world investments closer to home.The stakes could barely be higher. Just matching Englands aspiration of investing a th of local council pension funds in to infrastructure could release pound billion, or pound. billion. That is a lot. To give just a sense of the scale, it would be enough to pay for three more Queensferry Crossings, four Aberdeen bypasses or five new super hospitals such as Glasgows Queen Elizabeth.Any government, local or national, has a wishlist of capital projects but, in an age of austerity, far from always the access to cash to carry them out. And that is not just a current budget problem. Getting credit is also an issue.The Scottish Government has a capital borrowing cap of poundm a year and no more than pound billion overall. There are ious schemes - such as the old private finance initiative or the new non-profit distributing- for bringing in private money. And the UK Government has also been contributing through City Region Deals.Late last year, Mackay signaled capital projects of some pound billion in his - budget. But he and others want more. So getting well-funded local government pension funds to invest - usually infor safe, fixed long-term s - is a priority. Some funds, such as the giant Strathclyde oneare already putting pensionersrsquo money in Scottish bricks and mortar. The problem  Some of the funds are just too small to front the kind of money needed on their own. Hence talk of reform north of the border.Mackay, in an introduction to the formal consultation, clearly set out that he was not looking for institutional change for changersquos sake. ldquoThere are currently excellent examples of fund authorities collaborating on infrastructureprojects in Scotland, he said. ldquoWe look to fund authorities to improve their already positive impact on the economy thereby contributing further to sustainable economic growth, creating more jobs and supporting the delivery of key capital infrastructure needs.The stakes are not just financial. They are also political. And human: around , Scots are in the current  schemes. The SNP has already seen at least one centralizing project - the national police force - become a political football. A single scheme - already referred to by some as Pensions Scotland - would have to endure unprecedented scrutiny over its decision-making, not least on whether its investments were ethical. Even more pooling of funds to pay for national projects could thrust council pensions on to the political front line. ldquoThere is a risk pensions would look like a piggy bank for politicians,rsquo said one source.So political insiders -not pensioners and the general public - seem wise to this potential hazard. That may explain why Mackay and the Government are treading carefully. Informed sources say the Finance Secretary and his team have no firm view on the future shape of local government pension funds. They are awaiting the outcome of the consultation, which closed last month.An independent body, the Pensions Institute, is collating responses. Its findings will go to a an obscure body, the Scottish Local Government Pensions Scheme Advisory Board, sometimes this spring. The board, made up of councillors and trade unions, will then report back to Mackay. But battle lines are already drawn.THE EVANGELISTSimon Watson is leading the charge for a national scheme. He is a Unison organiser and, among other things, one of the trade unionists representing future and current pensioners on the advisory board.He sees lsquoPensions Scotlandrsquo as an opportunity to get better s from more ethical investments and still boost the real economy with jobs-creating infrastructure. That is a lot of bang for your council pension buck. Mr Watson said he thought government and local government was taking reform seriously. ldquoWe were concerned there might be a strong view of people looking after their own backyards,rsquorsquo he said, ldquoto keep their own schemes for the sake of it rather than the greater good. But there is a wide iety of views.He added: \"Because of the state of public sector finances, there is an overwhelming case for merging the funds and the wider benefits that will give to spending and services. We hope Mr Mackay will look a long those lines.Better performance for pension funds is fiscally signicant. Mr Watson reckons improvements in s could offer austerity-hit local authorities the chance to pay less in employer contributions. Even a modest drop in such payment could help council bottom-lines. In - they paid nearly pound billion into schemes.Watson reckons too many people - including private funds managers and advisors - are taking a cut out of pensions as things stand. So a central fund, he believes, would be more efficient, with more in-house expertise on everything from emerging markets equity funds to Scottish prison construction.But it is not just the pension funds that need more expertise, said Watson. Public bodies need to be better at pitching. He said: ldquoThere is an lsquoaskrsquo of the Scottish Government to co-ordinate better the investible opportunities.ldquoA national pension fund would still have to get due diligence done. Most of what would come from the government would be relatively low risk. Slightly lowerthan sone of the more high risk opportunities. The Forth Bridge might have been an opportunity. If there was an increase in council housing, that might be an opportunity too. Or more road building, or business parks to develop new industries.Unison, like other unions and some campaigners, have a problem about where some of their pensions are currently invested. ldquo People paying in to the funds have an ethical view,rsquo he said. ldquo If relatively small funds are looking at ethical investments they tend to be very conservative about it. They tend to say lsquooh, norsquo,something is a slightly higher risk. So the err on the side of caution, not making the best opportunities of ethnical investments, We think a single fund would give greater expertise in that.FRONTLINE VIEWRichard McIndoe is not convinced that big is beautul. Or more ethical. And he runs Scotlandrsquos largest council pension fund, the mighty Strathclyde, worth around pound billion, including a billion already in infrastructure.McIndoe is no enemy of the unions but he stressed that they do not need to worry about pensions, which are underwritten by councils and so will be paid however badly the funds reform. He said: ldquoThere is a mismatch of risk. If you start using the pension fund to promote campaigns in a political way, who pays the costsit goes wrong  It is the local authorities side. Not the trade union members. A national fund, he suggested, ldquowould give unions a lot of influence with much less repercussion.Strathclyde, as the biggest fund, has taken the biggest heat on its investment decisions. Should it have money in fossil fuels  Or arms firms  Or cigarettes  All three are important parts of the Scottish economy. McIndoe bemoans what he calls ldquoa lack of proportionality in criticism.He said: ldquoPart of the trade union argument is that you can create a bigger fund and it would have more influence. You can pretty much have the same influence by just jointly signing a letter. You have still got the same number of shares whether two pension funds own then or one. So it is a bit of a hollow argument. Strathclyde was one of the big institutional investors which late last year forced Royal Diutch Shell to link executive bonuses to carbon targets . His fund also championed living wage. Like Mr Watson, he thinks this makes business as well as ethical sense. But he is not trying to change the world ldquoWe are an active investor, he said. \"An activist is slightly dferent. But we play an active role.\"McIndoe has been watching events in England. He has not been impressed. ldquoBecause they have been forced to collaborate with each other, because they have going through a process of very hurriedly getting together, it has been chaotic and we have kept out of it.Strathclyde, which is administered by SNP-run Glasgow City Council, has made a formal submission to the review. Essentially it echoes McIndoersquos view that size is not everything. It said: ldquoMerging investments is certain to involve a concentration of risk. A full merger of Scottish funds might have slightly increased probability of success. But size is no guarantee of success, and the impact of failure would be very signicant. The biggest potential downsize  A ldquoconcentration of risk, said the fund.It added: ldquoA full merger of Scottish funds could increase investment in infrastructure, but this would depend on the investment strategy of the merged fund and those managing it. However, merging the funds simply to achieve more investment in infrastructure, which is not a primary pension fund objective, would be a perverse decision.Strathclyde, meanwhile, wants to keep council pensions in council control - evenin reality only  of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities have administrative power over the funds. It said: ldquoAt the extreme, merger into one fund would be likely to break the direct link between the scheme and local government by taking the fund out of local government control.Strathclyde is big. So big McIndoe does not consider investments of under poundm. Yet he stresses that big funds can do badly. Britainrsquos two largest, Universities Superannuation Scheme and the British Telecom Pension Scheme , manage about pound billion each. Both have funding deficits of more than pound billion.So which Scottish pension fund does best  Mr McIndoe laughs. That, he said, would be tiny Orkney.SMALL IS BEAUTIFULScotlandrsquos smallest local government pension fund is also the countryrsquos most successful, at least in terms of funding. A private fund runs Orkneyrsquos fund, which around poundm under management. It makes great s. But it invests nothing in infrastructure. Why  Because, it says, there are no opportunities on its scale.In a formal response to the current consultation, it said: ldquoThe principle impediment to investment in infrastructure for small funds is the lack of suitably attractive investment opportunities that are packaged in a manner that make them easy to access.It added: ldquoIf there were a suitable investment vehicle that offered the pension fund a route into infrastructure investment with an appropriatefor the level of risk, that might be persuasive.Like Strathclyde, Orkney does not like the principle of reforming pension funds to squeeze out more money for government projects. That, it said, ldquocould be a hugely costly mistake.It added: ldquoThose charged with stewardship of the pension schemes require to invest the funds for which they are responsible to earn the maximumpossible for the level of risk taken. Just as investments in arms, fracking, fossil fuels etc may be controversial,they are on balance the best investments to meet the objectives of pensions funds then that is where pension funds are invested.Orkneyrsquos take-away  If government wants pensions money, then it should put together some wrappers.Back in Glasgow Mr McIndoe conceded his fund would be willing to team up with smaller ones, opening up projects to smaller stakes. That he said would be ldquoabsolutely feasiblehellip.and desirable.WORKING TOGETHEROver in Edinburgh, the Lothian Fund is already co-operating, with neighbouring Falkirk, Fe and the Borders and even Northern Ireland. Between them, these funds have put some poundm in to infrastructure.Unlike Strathclyde and Orkney, it is very keen on a national fund, on a voluntary basis. Why  Because it believes governance would be cleaner and costs lower.Lothian already has an inhouse investment team, the only one of its kind, and a model for the kind of central fund Unison wants.The fundrsquos formal response echoes Mr Watsonrsquos concerns about massive hidden costs in the pension system. It said profits to private fund managers and advisors could be as high as poundm a year. Current accounting rules, it said, mean fees are under-reported. Its conclusion  As much as poundm in fees could be saved a year by taking expertise inhouse.It said: ldquoThe lack of transparency of investment fees and general lack of comparability of other aspects of the pension schemes hinders policymakers.The big advantage of a single find would, it said, would be a ldquogreater proportion of assets being managed in-house. \"Further, the benefits from initial savings will compound over time.TRANSPARENCY FEARMoreover, Lothian is concerned about the transparency of decision-making too. Some critics are concerned that existing structures contain a conflict of interest between funds and their administrations. But Lothianrsquos take is that many of the people who oversee funds, including councillors, do not know what they are doing. It said: ldquoGovernance is also inefficient. In the region of - people are involved in the pensions committees, many with limited knowledge and experience of pension matters.Its formal response to consultation suggests collaborations and pooling of funds could raise even more issues over accountability. It wants a bespoke governance system for a national fund. Why  Partly because it wants to guard against what it called a potentially increased risk of central government interference. That hazard was cited by almost every source contacted by The Herald on Sunday, including those in government.SHOW ME THE DEALSWhat do hard-nosed pension funds managers think when they hear politicians, whether at Westminster or Holyrood, seek more cash for projects  Some are already investing, and not just British ones. The fund representing Ontario teachers, for example, has been ploughing money in to UK bricks and mortar ndash and even Scottish gas networks.Strathclyde Pension Fund director Mr McIndoe summed up: ldquoShow me the deals. Show me the terms. What are we putting in  What are we getting back  In what period  Would we invest more in infrastructure  On the right terms, we would.ldquoFor us, infrastructure is fairly new. We have not been doing it that long. For most UK investors, it is fairly new. We will increase that investment. But how quickly we will increase our allocation will depend on the opportunities available."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-what-could-the-crucial-week-ahead-bring","story":"The vote had been scheduled to take place in December but was called off at the th hour with Government victory looking unlikely.MPs continue to be ided on the plans, with a number of pro-Remainers calling for Mrs Mayrsquos deal to be voted down, and some ardent Leavers pushing for the same result to ensure a no-deal Brexit.Herersquos a look at what could happen following Tuesdayrsquos vote:The simplest outcome to plot comesGovernment wins the vote on the Withdrawal Agreement.In this instance, the UK would leave the European Union on March .But should Mrs Mayrsquos deal be voted down, then a whole host of scenarios could play out.An amendment passed by Parliament means that the Government must come back with their Plan B three days following the vote.The prospect of Labour putting forward a vote of no confidence in Mrs May has been mooted and a general election could take place should the Government lose.The Government could also ask for an extension to Article  ndash which would have to be agreed by the remaining  members of the bloc ndash either from the current Government or in the instance that a new Prime Minister was appointed either following a vote of no confidence or should Mrs May resign.Should the EU not agree to a postponing of Brexit then the UK would leave the EU without a deal on March .

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Nevertheless, well over  party-goers turned out to sing along with local band CoverCover who played popular hits such as the Proclaimers Im Gonna Be .Thursos Santa Claus decoration in the square looked a bit worse for wear as it fell to the ground in the high winds, with one reveller joking that \"hed had too much mulled wine\".Santa wasnt the only casualty and a few wreaths from the base of the Victory war memorial were blown away as well.Tracey added: \"Well be holding an AGM soon and details of this will go on Facebook page for anyone interested in being a part of future events.\"Wed like to thank all those who volunteered, helping with the litter pick at the end, and the sponsors, as well as everyone who attended.\"In Wick, the heat was on as  revellers braved the wind and gathered around the annual bonfire at the top of Bignold Park.Under the guidance of local man Iain Sutherland ndash who revived the tradition over  years ago with friend Mackie MacDonald after the council had given up on it ndash a ft high conglomeration of discarded Christmas trees, wooden pallets and compressed paper had been built earlier that same day.Looking down from a safe vantage point in his daughter Helens car, Iain said he was proud and \"delighted\" as he watched the bonfire take hold.His son-in-law Mervyn Hill, who runs the Netherclfe Hotel with Helen, had not only learned the fine art of fire-building but had organised for some members of the towns pipe band to bring in  with Hogmanay tunes.\"Its been a successful night and despite the wind we had around  people show up,\" said Mervyn.\"We had people of all ages here. It was a good family event and everything went really well.\"Mervyn explained how his father-in-law had shown him techniques to make the blaze take hold by building around a central core of compressed paper and cardboard. \"You need to make a tunnel into the centre. Then you light a box, push it in and away she goes. The wind blows through the pallets and eggs it on too.\"Mervyn said that the help of local contractors, builders and volunteers helped keep the tradition going.Long after the public had left as the rain came on at around .am, Mervyn was still busy tending to the fire with a sturdy rake in his hand.\"Ill keep an eye on it through the night and make sure its under control,\" he said. \"Ill rake up what I can and come back when its cooled down to pick up any nails that people or their pets could get injured by.\"* See this weeks John OGroat Journal for more Hogmanay pictures.Monday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118861.jpg","title":"Young people make their mark","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointIN , Scotland came together to celebrate its younger generation.Year of Young Peopleinspired the whole country to look at eight to -year-olds in a more open, positive way: celebrating their achievements, valuing their contributions and giving them an opportunity to influence decision-making.In a year dominated by political uncertainty, young people were the positive force in making change happen. More than  young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, YoYP was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision-makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy.This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Ministers Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It creates the impression that voters are now entirely tribal.If you take any issue of the day and feed it into Twitter or Facebook, the responses of users of those s will be of the black and white iety. Social media is no great enabler of nuance.But the truth is that huge numbers of people neither use social media nor feel the need to align themselves with a particular camp. The floating voter still exists, we just don’t hear much from her because she’s getting on with her le in the real world.If you want proof that social media isn’t the be-all-and-end-all of political debate, consider the matter of Scottish independence. Spend even a few minutes on Twitter and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Scots think of nothing other than the constitutional question.It’s undoubtedly the case that independence – whether of the Scottish or Brexit iety – is the major issue of our political times but it remains the case that other things matter, too. Not least among these important factors is the perceived competence of those who would lead us.This is a truth that should, right now, be focusing the minds of those closest to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP came to power at Holyrood in  not solely thanks to the votes of those in favour of Scottish independence. Rather, the nationalists enjoyed – and, to a lesser extent, continue to enjoy – the backing of voters who support the maintenance of the United Kingdom.The most signicant factor in creating this apparent contradiction was the widely held belief that the Labour Party had lost its way. Cast your mind back to the  election and you’ll recall how then SNP leader Alex Salmond and his team went to great s to reassure Scots that a vote for the nationalists need not be considered a vote in favour of independence. Instead, insisted Salmond, a vote for the SNP should be seen as a vote for competent government.That SNP reputation for competence may not have quite the shine it once had but – in part, thanks to Scottish Labour’s inability to mount anything like a serious opposition – it remains. The First Minister’s handling of the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by two female civil servants against Salmond stands to destroy the goodwill that has kept the SNP in power for  years.Last week’s Court of Session ruling that the Scottish Government investigation into these allegations was procedurally flawed was bad enough. The women who brought forward complaints have been left high and dry while the taxpayer faces a £,-plus bill after the government accepted it had failed to follow the process to the letter.But more was to come.We have known since the allegations about Salmond surfaced last year that Sturgeon met him on a number of occasions during which, she says, she made it clear to him that she could and would not intervene in the case.During First Minister’s Question Time on Thursday, the First Minister was forced to expand on that.It emerged, under questioning from acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw, that during the first of these meetings – of which no minutes exist – Sturgeon’s Chief of Staff, Liz Lloyd, was present. Lloyd – a government employee whose status as a special adviser permits her to act on party matters – was wearing her SNP hat that day, Sturgeon told MSPs.The First Minister was adamant that what was discussed that day was not a government matter. I wish her good luck sustaining that line.A meeting between the First Minister and her predecessor to discuss allegations of sexual misconduct raised by government employees is very much a government matter. To suggest otherwise is insulting.This is a view shared by some who back Sturgeon.“She should never have agreed to meet him. Simple as that,” says one party insider whose loyalties lie with the current FM rather than her predecessor. Another veteran activist, with identical sympathies, asks who in the First Minister’s team thought such meetings were at all appropriate.These Sturgeon loyalists make the point that her handling of this matter is exactly the sort of thing that began to chip away at trust in Scottish Labour.I’m bound to agree.Sturgeon – who refuses, beyond saying that she told him she would not intervene in the case, to go into detail about the discussions she had with Salmond – is now testing the goodwill of voters who believed her to be competent and honest. Without minutes of the meetings, we can only take the First Minister’s word that she acted appropriately. That’s a big ask.Despite the best efforts of Team Sturgeon to deny the existence of a civil war in the SNP over this issue, it’s perfectly clear that hostilities between supporters of the First Minister and supporters of Salmond represent exactly that. The SNP is now angrily ided. People have picked sides.A number of high-profile Salmond supporters – former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, former health secretary Alex Neil and former presiding officer Tricia Marwick among them – have come out to bat on his behalf.The response from the Sturgeon camp has been rather muted.One party insider says: “Nobody on Sturgeon’s side is used to war. They don’t know how to handle what’s happening.”That same source makes the point that, when Salmond was first minister, Sturgeon, former SNP communications chief Kevin Pringle and former MP Angus Robertson formed a tightly-knit unit that advised and, to some degree, controlled their boss, and asks who performs the same role for the current party leader  It certainly appears that Sturgeon would have benefited from having people on her team who would have advised against meeting Salmond.SNP infighting over the Salmond investigation will only get bloodier, while the First Minister’s role in matters can only further erode her credibility with the moderate mainstream voters she needsthe nationalists are to win the next Holyrood election.We may now be witnessing the beginning of the end of the SNP’s dominance of our politics.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855794.1547387595!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander star sam heughan sees his fortune soar after successful 2018","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Outlander star Sam Heughan#s fortune has soared thanks to the success of the hit fantasy series.The heart-throb Scots actor has seen his wealth rise to more than £.million since gathering a global following playing Highland warrior Jamie Fraser in the drama.The ‘Outlander’ effect has been credited with boosting Scotland’s economy as the number of visitors to historic sites topped five million for the first time in  with fans flocking to see filming locations for the show.: Outlander star Sam Heughan: is he Scottish, is he married and is he making any public appearances And it seems its popularity has also boosted Heughan’s bank balance after his company posted an impressive set of results.Accounts filed at Companies House for his firm Cairn Mor Creative show it had total assets of £,, for .: Outlander quiz: How well do you know the Scottish series After paying off creditors to the tune of almost £,, the company reported shareholder funds of £,,.That is a rise of almost £, on the previous year when the firm was valued at £,.

A statement released by Evans immediately after the case insisted that a new “procedure” to oversee complaints against current and former ministers is “robust”.Salmond had been challenging this procedure before a flaw in the way it was applied came to light. It emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed to the role, had previously been in contact with the two women making the complaints and advised them on the issue.It was on this basis that the government case collapsed on Tuesday and Evans stated afterwards: “All other grounds of Mr Salmond’s challenge have been dismissed.”But this has been rejected by the former first minister.“The Permanent Secretary is in denial and her claims are materially misleading,” a spokesman for Salmond said.“She tried to suggest that the court rejected the arguments made by Mr Salmond which is absolutely the opposite of what occurred. “The whole action was dismissed on the basis of the Scottish Government’s concession that they had acted unlawfully, as well as all of the expenses, and therefore we didn’t need to go any further in comprehensively winning the case. “The Scottish Government case collapsed at the very first hurdle. They would have fallen at all the other hurdles as wellthe case had continued to the full hearing.” But a Scottish Government spokesman said last night: “The court order is clear. It says that all other aspects ofSalmond’s petition were ‘dismissed’.“The Scottish Government co-operated fully with the court process for the recovery of documents. “The full picture only became clear in December  as a result of work being undertaken to produce documents in advance of the hearing.“It was in light of that work that we agreed to settle the case. As the Permanent Secretary has made clear, the single procedural flaw which led to this decision is deeply regrettable.”A separate police investigation has been launched into the claims made against Salmond dating back to December  when he was first minister. But once this has concluded Evans has made clear that the Scottish Government could re-launch an inquiry into Salmond – using the same procedure introduced in late  in response to the global #MeToo movement.This could raise the prospect of a fresh legal challenge from Salmond over his original contention that the process used to investigate him was unfair. He has previously claimed that he was denied access to witnesses and blocked from presenting his own side of the case. The “flaw” over the links between the investigating officer and the two women need not have brought about the collapse of the government’s case. Ministers could have sought to have the case remitted for further action. Although this would still have meant a symbolic victory for Salmond, it would none the less have allowed the government to restart its inquiry, this time using the correct procedure. Salmond’s spokesman added: “Their legal position was hopeless which is why their case collapsed before we even got to the first day of the hearing and interestingly before all the internal documents they were so reluctant to produce and required to be extracted from them by a commission ordered by Lord Pentland were discussed in open court. These documents are legal dynamite.”It emerged that members of Sturgeon’s inner circle, including chief of staff Liz Lloyd, were among those to give evidence in the case before it collapsed.Ministers have denied any link between this and the government conceding defeat.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855756.1547330852!/image/image.jpg","title":"grassroots to send ultimatum to corbyn on brexit","story":"Senior Labour figures will face immediate pressure from party members to change party policy and oppose Brexit within hours of the meaningful vote on Theresa May#s deal with Brussels.Key allies of Jeremy Corbyn at the top of the Labour party will be confronted with grassroots demands for a second EU referendum less than  hours after the Commons vote, set for Tuesday, which the government is expected to lose heavily.The Prime Minister will have three days toto the Commons with a “plan B” for Brexit, during which time opposition parties will also seek to impose their will on the next steps in the process.The Labour leader has resisted pressure to fully embrace a second EU referendum that could reverse Brexit, saying his priority is a general election.But this week saw confusion at the highest levels over what Brexit policy Labour would take into that election, with members of the shadow cabinet and Scottish party leader Richard Leonard facing criticism for failing to spell out the position, while shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said an extension of Article  was now “inevitable”.A survey of Labour members found that  per cent want a second referendum on EU membership, and polling suggests the party could be particularly badly hit in ScotlandLabour backs May’s Brexit deal.The YouGov poll for the People’s Vote campaign found that support for Labour in Scotland would fall by  percentage points to  per cent, costing all but one of the party’s seven MPs north of the border.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rebecca Long-Bailey, will hear direct pleas from party members for a robust anti-Brexit policy at a key policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday at Labour HQ in London.The two Labour front benchers sit on the Economy, Business and Trade Commission of the party’s National Policy Forum , which will consider submissions from ordinary members, elected Labour officials and constituency Labour parties.The open submissions process has been flooded with demands for a People’s Vote since Corbyn gave an interview to thesaying that Labour would press ahead with Brexitit won power.

may makes final plea to mps in attempt to save her brexit deal","story":"Theresa May will liken Brexit to referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales in a last-ditch appeal to MPs to respect the will of the people and ensure the UK leaves the EU.In a speech on the eve of a crucial vote in the House of Commons on her deal with Brussels, the Prime Minister will ask the public to imagineWestminster had rejected the outcome of votes that created the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly.It comes as opposition MPs published draft legislation for a fresh referendum that would give voters the chance to reverse Brexit.With less than  hours to go until the vote, Mrs May will warn that parliament is more likely to block Brexit than allow Britain to crash out of the EU without a deal.However, while a small number of Conservative Brexiteers have now said they will back her deal to ensure that Brexit is delivered, the government is still expected to fall to a heavy defeat.Warning of “catastrophic harm” to public trust in politiciansBrexit isn’t delivered, Mrs May will “ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy”.The Prime Minister is expected to say: “Imaginean anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, Parliament knew better and would overrule them, or  force them to vote again.”Mrs May will add: “When the people of Wales voted by a margin of .%, on a turnout of just over %, to endorse the creation of the Welsh Assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned.”The Prime Minister will say that while the two sides in the  referendum disagreed on many things, they were united on one thing – that “what the British people decided, the politicians would implement”.Four Brexiteer backbenchers announced on Sunday they will back the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement.One of the four, Sir Edward Leigh, said it was “now inconceivable that this Parliament, and this Speaker, will allow the UK to leave on WTO terms on March .“Therefore my message to my fellow Brexit-supporting MPs is you are playing with fireyou vote down this deal in the hope of something better, and the only way to deliver Brexit is to vote for the deal this week.”Legislation to bring about a second referendum has been published by a cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians, including representatives from Labour and the Conservatives.The draft bill recommends that the public be asked whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave under the Prime Minister’s deal.Organisers note that Article  would have to be extended in order for another poll to take place, meaning the UK would remain a member of the EU beyond March .The legislation could be introduced through the House of Lords under plans being considered by the group, which also includes SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.It recommends the ballot paper be worded: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union on the negotiated terms ”Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the bill provides the Government with an “escape hatch”there is no majority in Parliament for Theresa May’s deal or no deal. “This Bill provides a legally credible way forward, and a politically credible way forward,” he added.Mr Blackford said MPs had a “responsibility to present an alternative route to protect our economy and citizens rights”. He said: “Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the SNP believe this Bill is an effort to build a consensus across the house for a second EU referendum.”The group has also drafted a ‘Paving Bill’ designed to enable the Electoral Commission to start the necessary consultation around a referendum question and lead campaign designation.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855733.1547380311!/image/image.jpg","title":"the flying scotsman is returning to scotland","story":"The world#s most famous locomotive is ing to Scotland # but passengers will have to pay up to # for the experience.Flying Scotsman will visit Inverness from Edinburgh in May for only the second time in its -year history.The cost of the excursion for those in first class includes champagne and cakes and three nights in a four-star hotel in the Highland capital.However, excursions during the trip will cost extra and thejourney will be hauled by a diesel-powered engine rather than steam.Premium standard passengers, paying £ each, will receive free tea and coffee and be put up at a Holiday Inn Express.Last year, Flying Scotsman ran trips from Edinburgh over the Forth Bridge and round Fe for £ for first-class passengers and £ in premium standard.The locomotive previously visited Inverness in  as part its last visit to Scotland.May’s tour will see the engine jointly haul the train with Mayflower, a B class steam locomotive built in . Mayflower will also run separate trips from Inverness during the tour to Wick and Thurso, and Kyle of Lochalsh, at extra cost.A spokeswoman for organisers The Steam Dreams Rail Co, said: “This time, instead of the short trips around the Fe Circle, we are offering a four-day tour to Inverness, with Flying Scotsman and sister locomotive Mayflower double-heading on the first day from Edinburgh to Inverness, via the Forth Bridge and the Highland main line.”She said the price of the tickets reflected the extra cost of having two locomotives, with the trip part of a nine-day tour from London.Steam Dreams owner David Buck said: “Flying Scotsman has not been to Inverness in recent history, and to experience the two locomotives performing at full power over this steeply-graded railway will be a great prospect for all lovers of steam. “It is the first time we have given passengers from Scotland an opportunity to join part of one of our nine-day tours.”The visit will be Flying Scotsman’s fourth consecutive annual foray north of the border. Other previous excursions have been on the Borders Railway.The locomotive made a special trip from London King’s Cross to York on Friday as a memorial to Sir William McAlpine, who was credited with rescuing the engine and paying for its restoration when he bought it in .Flying Scotsman was designed by Edinburgh-born Sir Nigel Gresley to haul the same-named Edinburgh-London express on the east coast main line.It was the first steam locomotive to reach mph, in , and set a record for the longest non-stop run, of  miles, in Australia in . The engine was restored at a cost of more than £ million by the National Railway Museum.Further Flying Scotsman trips are expected to be announced shortly by the museum.Steam will also come to Aberdeen this summer with Tornado, which featured in Paddington  and on Top Gear, hauling a new service called The Aberdonian.The locomotive, built in , will run the service in March, August and September, withfares costing between £ and £.Graeme Bunker-James, operations director of The A Steam Locomotive Trust, which runs Tornado, said: “We are extremely proud to be launching ‘The Aberdonian’ series of new special steam-hauled trains.”The Jacobite steam train between Fort William and Mallaig will also , with daily trips between April and October. Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, which runs tracks and signals, said: “Tornado is a shining example of British engineering, reflecting the country that invented railways, and giving pleasure on every trip to thousands of Scots as it traverses Scotland.“I hope this series of trips becomes a permanent feature of the Scottish railway scene.” The Bo’ness-based Scottish Railway Preservation Society has yet to announce whether it will repeat last year’s steam-hauled trips over the Forth Bridge and round Fe.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855706.1547316841!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli lost leader gives corbyn cause to cringe","story":"Shortly after MPs voted against the government to limit the Treasury#s powers in the event of no deal, Steve Anglesey, journalist for the pro-Remain newspaper The New European, tweeted a photograph of Yvette Cooper with the caption: #The leader of the Opposition has turned up.#Like all good political sideswipes, this one took its power from its pinpoint accuracy. With her amendment to the finance bill, the backbench MP had done more to try to safeguard the country from the worst-case scenario than Jeremy Corbyn has done in months .Cooper’s move means that, should the government want to use some of the specic powers in the finance bill to implement no deal, it would have to first give parliament a vote or apply to extend article . It does not prevent no deal but it does make it more dficult to navigate and so, arguably, reduces the likelihood of it taking place.With typical churlishness, Corbyn failed to acknowledge Cooper’s achievement in a statement he said Labour was taking every opportunity to prevent no deal, without ever mentioning her name.Other people, however, were more appreciative. And not for the first time, the words “ only” were repeated as a lament to past leadership elections and missed opportunities. Corbyn’s simmering resentment of his former rival is only to be expected. Cooper may have come a poor third when she stood against him in the  she may have been pushed to the backbenches by those who despise her as a Blairite, but her quiet strengths still serve to accentuate Corbyn’s blustering weaknesses.The Tory government could not have done more to sabotage itself and its citizensit had assembled the finest minds in the country and asked them to draw up a step-by-step plan. Any political leader worth a damn would be annihilating Theresa May at PMQs every week and charting a clear route out of the current crisis.Instead, Corbyn has dithered and delayed. Every trap that has been set for him, he has fallen into every internal problemhe has exacerbated. If an opportunity to land a blow has presented itself to him, he has squandered it. Thus the Tory party staggers on critically wounded, but with no-one willing or able to put it out of its misery.At no point has Corbyn come up with a coherent strategy on Brexit. His own MPs and MSPs have been in a constant state of confusion over the party’s position on everything from whether or not to stay in the Customs Union to whether or not to support a second referendum.Now Corbyn has called for a general election to break the deadlock yet such is the internal disarray that, on Thursday, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was unable to say whether the party intended to campaign for or against leaving the EU.As Corbyn and his shadow cabinet have been failing to bring down a government already on its knees, Cooper has been distinguishing herself in the Home Affairs Select Committee and on the back benches. When May announced the snap general election in April , Cooper won plaudits for her caustic put-down. “The Prime Minister said yesterday that she was calling a General Election because parliament was blocking Brexit, but three-quarters of this parliament voted for article  and two-thirds of the Lords voted for article , so that’s not true, is it ” she said.“A month ago she told her official spokesman to rule out an election and that wasn’t true either, was it  She wants us to believe that she is a woman of her word but isn’t the truth that we cannot believe a single word she says ” She attacked the government on its decision to end a scheme to take lone child refugees and single-handedly forced the resignation of Amber Rudd during the Windrush scandal with one quietly delivered, but dynamite question: “Targets for removals [deportations] – when were they set ” she asked. Rudd denied any such targets existed – a statement quickly established as  – and so she had to go.Admittedly, Cooper comes with baggage. As her critics never tire of pointing out, she previously backed a stricter asylum regime and did not oppose the government’s Immigration Bill. She also voted in favour of the Iraq War and lobbied to restrict benefits for new EU migrants.Having said that, were Brexit to happen, without or without a deal, the situation for EU migrants would be considerably worse. In a Westminster and Labour Party with a superfluity of egos and a dearth of semi-competent operators, at least Cooper comes across as serious, able and committed.Corbyn posits himself as the voice of the working classes, yet he has done little to try to stop the economic havoc that is about to be unleashed upon themCooper is a dreaded centrist, but understands voters were sold a lie, and that the most vulnerable will be the hardest hit.Accused of being unpatriotic for trying to make it more dficult for the Prime Minister, she insisted it would \u2028be unpatriotic to do anything , given the damage a no-deal Brexit would inflict.For this, former Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts derided her as earnest and compared her to a kindergarten teacher talking down to her pupils. She saw herself, he said, as more in tune with morality than others. Looking round Westminster at the moment that seems a reasonable assumption. After all, the bar isn’t set very high. Amidst the preening and braying of the Brexiteer donkeys, and the student politics posturing of the Corbyn camp, her sober,slightly sanctimonious, manner is a breath of fresh air.After Cooper’s performance in the wake of the snap general election announcement, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell was seen mouthing the words “leadership pitch”. In the end there was no third leadership contest it is impossible to know whether Labour would have won had she been at the helm.But Cooper’s achievement in forcing the first of two humiliating government defeats means she is once again a contender, with some admirers suggesting she should be asked to head up a Government of National UnityGiven there is less unity in Westminster than there is at the average wedding scramble, this seems unlikely. But she does now feel like a leader-in-waiting.Last weekend, one poll suggested Labour would lose by a landslideit backed Brexit in any forthcoming general election and yet even this does not appear to be focusing minds.On the evidence of the past few days, Cooper is exactly what the party needs: a woman capable of taking on the Tories with a grit, determination and charm that Corbyn lacks a woman who understands that the point of being in Opposition is to try to get yourself back into power.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

Everyone is welcome to come along, whether they want to take part or simply have a chat with the instructors to find out more about the club.Ali has trained in Muay Thai since  and started at the world-famous Wicker Camp in Sheffield. After visiting Thailand in  to train there for the first time, he has gone on to train in several gyms across the country which is known as the birthplace of the sport. He is a registered instructor with the United Kingdom Muay Thai Federation.The women-only classes will be taught by Arriayn Leighton who was ranked number four in Scotland last year for Muay Thai. Arriayn has trained with Ali for the last six years and has also trained across Scotland and England. this week, Ali, who has run the club for several years, said it was good to finally have permanent premises for the club.He said: “We#ve been running classes on and off for about seven years # but we#ve never had our own premises, so it#s been dficult to sustain. Also, I work shts at Portree Hospital and Broadford Hospital as an Advanced Nurse Practitioner so it#s dficult to commit to regular class times. But now, along with myself, we have Arriayn to teach some Muay Thai classes and Damon Driver to teach self-defence classes # Damon has trained extensively with the British Combat Association.Originally a battlefield martial art dating back thousands of years, Muay Thai is known as ‘the Art of Eight Limbs’ and is the national sport of Thailand.“We train in traditional Thai-style”, Ali added. “Classes consist of a -minute warm-up, stretching, technique teaching, and around five three-minute rounds of pad work. We also offer private sessions, either one-to-one or for small groups of up to four people by arrangement. The club is open to anyone from aged five and upwards.”that the National Lottery funding would enable them to equip the gym with a boxing ring and to set-up one of the other rooms as a community gym facility with weights and exercise equipment.Article by Adam Gordon"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/001WH0401NCA.jpg","title":"oil rig arrival sparks gear move for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreel fishermen from Skye and the west Highlands have spent the last couple of weeks moving their gear from the path of a ,-tonne oil rig that is due to be moored off Kishorn next week.The Ocean GreatWhite will spend several weeks at the Kishorn Port Ltd yard in preparation for its transportation to the North Sea to drill for oil. It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults. The resident also believes that there may have been an attempt by someone to cover over the graffiti.Mayor Lindsay Millar said: “I condemn this act of vandalism and appeal for anybody with information to contact the PSNI.“This park is enjoyed by the entire community and antisocial behaviour must not be tolerated. “Our Borough has a number of award-winning parks, which staff and the community work hard to maintain.“Our staff are currently working to remove the paint, however, damage to the park fencing is more substantial and will take some time to repair. “The play area will remain closed until all repair work has been completed and it is safe to use again.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1376897.jpg--.jpg?1546959914000\n","title":"agewell partnership delivering handyman service to residents","story":"Mid  East Antrim Agewell Partnershipare a local charity working across Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne to support older people.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast priest calls for greater respect to be shown to city cemetery","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein.

They described the last week as an “ordeal”, and have asked to meet the officers involved in the operation in a bid for answers.“The close and extended families of Dr Deirdre Donnelly O’Flaherty wish to express their heartfelt gratitude for the many kind and thoughtful messages of support which they have received over the course of what has been a tumultuous and distressing week leading up to the th anniversary of Deirdre’s disappearance on the th of January , ” they stated.“The families are relieved only because this ordeal is over although in our view, the outcome was not in doubt.“Notication that Gardai were going to carry out a land search for Deirdre was entirely unexpected, not least given that the finding by Order of Judge Deeney at Belfast High Court on the th of January  that Deirdre had ‘gone into the water and drowned’ was supported by the oral evidence of the investigating Garda Sergeant.“As far as the families are aware there has not in fact been any ongoing search for Deirdre since at least that time.“The families had only three days’ advance notice of the Gardai excavations near Milford, County Donegal and therefore had little time to prepare for the consequences of the very public, national exposure of this story during the week.“Gardai confirmed to the families at that time that the decision to conduct the excavation in a remote area over fty miles from her last known whereabouts flowed from an anonymous note handed in to a Garda station in County Monaghan in August . This note apparently provided precise map co-ordinates for the location of Deirdre’s remains. “The families have not seen this note and this information was not made public due to the ongoing nature of the investigation. In their Press Release yesterday Gardai stated that they had ‘found nothing to further the search’.“Accordingly, the families have requested a meeting with the Gardai investigation team to discuss a number of questions relating to the conduct, conclusions and consequences of this investigation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new teachers in northern ireland worst paid in uk and republic claim unions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Fein has suggested advocates of a no-deal Brexit should be the ones left to man the pumps and explain the disaster to people.In a letter sent to many staff yesterday and without reference to Brexit, officials said disruption to supplies was unlikely but it was necessary to put emergency response plans in place. They said Stormonts Department for the Economy would work with the oil industry to ensure those providing key s, such as hospitals and staff, continue to receive fuel until normal supply is restored. The letter said: \"These organisations and iniduals would be directed to a network of strategically located filling stations spread across Northern Ireland and identied as a priority for supply from reduced stocks.\" Two civil servants would be located at each of the designated stations during any emergency to monitor demand and ensure that the process runs smoothly. Volunteers would check the validity of fuel permits presented by iniduals identied by their organisations as a priority to receive fuel from designated filling stations, the letter said. \"Details must be recorded of the amount and type of fuel purchased so HQ staff can track demand patterns. \"Training will be provided and they will explain the scheme to customers, thus leaving filling station staff free to dispense fuel and take payment.\" The last time serious disruption happened to the oil industry here was in  during the loyalist Ulster Workers Council strike in protest at the Sunningdale Agreement.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said: \"The advocates of a no-deal Brexit should be left to staff the pumps and explain the disaster of a no-deal Brexit.\"A statement from the department said for many years it had worked closely with industry. It added: \"This process is not new and is a routine exercise to bring the resource back to the required capacity.\" Due to staff changes it was considered \"prudent\" to reissue the call for volunteers."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland schools asking parents for 60 per month to plug","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As news of his detention spread, he was then released.“I thank everyone for the quick response in the face of abuse against my husband by the dictatorship,” Fabiana Rosales said in a message posted on Twitter. “The dictatorship will not be able to bend his fighting spirit.”Adding to the confusion, the government tried to sht the blame to Mr Guaido’s allies, with communications minister Jorge Rodriguez saying that the “media show” had perhaps been orchestrated to provoke an international uproar.But he acknowledged that police officers had taken part in the arrest and said they would be disciplined.“We want to inform the people of Venezuela that the officials who took that upon themselves are being dismissed,” Mr Rodriguez said on state TV.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Supporters of President Nicolas Maduro came out onto the streets as he was sworn-in for a second term in Caracas last week At the rally after the incident, Mr Guaido told The Associated Press that the SEBIN agents informed him they were carrying out orders from above when they arrested him.“We are survivors,” he told the crowd of a few hundred waving Venezuelan flags.Mr Guaido has been leading an increasingly tense stand-off with Mr Maduro seeking to oust him from power, winning the support of some powerful international allies like US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke to him by phone shortly after the -year-old assumed the presidency of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.At a rally on Friday he said he was prepared to take over as Venezuela’s interim president and call for new elections, a move the US and regional governments support.But for such a strategy to succeed, he said Venezuelans must take to the streets to express their discontent with Mr Maduro’s wrecking of what was once Latin America’s wealthiest nation. To that end, he called for nationwide demonstrations on January  to coincide with the anniversary of the  ousting of military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit british government proposals described love letter dup","story":"CAPTION:Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson pictured yesterday at the Green Line in Cyprus with party adviser Collette McAllister."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly prize draw winner","story":"This weeks winners in the Foyle Hospice Prize Draw are -

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers.

We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a massive skill and they all have it.ldquoThey also have physical fitness, leadership skills, decision making, commitment, respect for others, teamwork, loyalty, integrity, discipline and courage to name just a few.ldquoIn a nutshell, they have a huge range of transferable skills, which combined with education, will maximise their potential and make them highly employable and major assets to society and the economy.Speakers at the event include GCU principal and vice-chancellor Professor Pamela Gillies, MSPs Annie Wells and Maurice Corry, Scottish Veterans Commissioner Colonel Charlie Wallace and Deputy Commander of  Infantry Brigade and HQ Scotland Colonel Sandy Fitzpatrick.Professor Nolan, principal and vice-chancellor of ENU, said: ldquoFormer armed forces personnel have so much to offer in terms of skills and le experience.ldquoAs a university, we are committed to supporting their transition to civilian le and future career development through mentoring programmes for veterans who work with us and flexible entry paths on to degree courses for prospective students.Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said it was ldquofantastic that GCU was taking the joint lead in supporting Scotlandrsquos veterans reach their full potential after leaving the military.Ms Well said: ldquoAll too often we hear of cases of those in the military who have been let down upon their attempts to integrate back into civilian le.

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind.

My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"outlook  uncertain times may lead to a business downturn","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Its already the New Year and economist John Simpson examines whats facing the Northern Ireland business community in the next  months The early weeks and months of  pose more dficult prospects for managing the economy and maintaining and boosting business continuity than key decision makers would either wish for or normally expect. In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
