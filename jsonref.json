I used to have some people tell me, date someone for a year, get to know them and see them. I have had some really crazy relationships.\u0027And men over stepping their boundaries. I am very much about a man being a man and a woman being a woman. And I am all about power couples like Jay Z and Beyonce.\u0027It is a rarity you do not find that every day. I know that Jimmy Kimmel and everyone are saying that women are resorting to dating fish - that is how bad the spectrum is to dating. I am back in my bachelors program and I am not focused on dating. But when I do date, I am not really intrigued right now.       Abraham voiced her concerns for her 10-year-old daughter Sophia\u0027s online life\u0027With all my life experiences I feel like I have lived about five different lives from successful businesses to TV shows to being creative. And I do feel like I will find a man that fits my goals and aspirations and someone to help me with those and be a partner in that.\u0027A person needs to be a serial entrepreneur like myself . And I have only seen very few men who can do three things at one time. Some men can only do one thing at one time, and I am like, you have got to do it all. And when it comes to first dates... I am not one for a drink and a date. I am like, I will meet you in Bali, let\u0027s go have an experience. I take it to another level. I am a whole lot of fun.\u0027Abraham spoke at the Nazarian Institute\u0027s ThinkBIG 2020 Conference at 1 Hotel West Hollywood.

He is Minim, a “soft-spoken man with the strange name that means Nothing”, one of those who has answered the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie’s call to arms provoked by the Italian invasion of the country in 1935. But Minim has an unexpectedly propitious quality a close resemblance to Selassie, now in exile in Bath, that can be used to reinvigorate popular confidence that the European colonialists can be defeated. Dressed in a makeshift uniform and sitting on horseback with a red umbrella across his saddle, Minim has only to appear in the hills so recently dominated by Italian troops to strengthen his subjects. As he is instructed by the comrade who has helped to hatch the plan: “To be in the presence of our emperor is to stand before the sun. You must respect his power to give you life and burn you alive.”A different novel might put this curious interlude at its heart fiction as written by a popular historian such as, say, Ben Mcintyre. But in Mengiste’s story - which draws on her own family history, with a grandfather who fought against the Italians – shadows and echoes abound and multiply, ensuring that although its participants are faced with clear and present danger, they continue to be intimately bound to the generations and iniduals that have gone before them.When the book begins, we imagine that its arena might be small, and confined. We are in a compound, in which tensions seethe between Hirut, an orphaned young woman who has recently joined the household as a sort of maid of all work, and her mistress, Aster. Hirut’s arrival has been effected by Aster’s husband, Kidane, an old friend of Hirut’s parents Aster is both suspicious of their past connection and grieving deeply for the child she and Kidane have lost. Initially, the reader’s sympathies seem clearly directed: towards the vulnerable Hirut and protective Kidane, and away from the capricious and occasionally malicious Aster. Their battles, worked out in a series of claustrophobic rooms, including the minute bedroom that Hirut shares with a cook and the more luxurious quarters given to the elegant Aster, are painful and without prospect of resolution.But circumstances change, and rapidly. In Eritrea and Somalia, Italian commanders are mobilising their forces to reprise their attempts to control Ethiopia, first thwarted in the 1890s now, under Mussolini’s mythologising aegis, they are ready to try once again. For the Ethiopian men, such as Kidane, who gather their own forces to repel the invaders, that first conflict is still present in their minds, and its reprisal presents them with a chance to avenge their fathers’ defeats.What, though, of the women? In a scene of extreme marital disharmony near the beginning of the book, Aster makes clear her refusal to wait at home for her husband’s return. Subsequently she dons his tunic, jodhpurs and cape and sets off to war in blazingly described fashion, taking Hirut with her. The story that follows – predominantly one of the cat-and-mouse game between Italian and Ethiopian forces – is interspersed with fragments: descriptions of the documentary photographs taken by a young Venetian soldier, Ettore brief glimpses of Selassie in Bath, as he contemplates the potential destruction of his rule and, by way of comfort, devotes himself to listening to the opera Aida and the interjections of a Greek-style chorus. Alongside the story of Hirut, Aster and Kidane comes that of the Jewish Ettore, exiled from his family and only latterly learning of his father’s own exile from his native Russia. As he waits for letters from his parents, he is confronted by the news that Jewish soldiers will be required to register their ethnicity, and begins to receive reports of growing antisemitism at home.It is both a reasonably conventional narrative – there is plenty of action, detailed description and a focus spread between the principal characters – and a subtly unpredictable one. History and modernity are juxtaposed in the factual asymmetries of warfare (the Ethiopians must rely on outdated and often malfunctioning weapons and have no way of long-distance communication beyond running messengers). They are also set side by side in the modes of consciousness that all the characters experience. While their instincts for battle, whether attack or defence, seem rooted in the primal, they are constantly having to adjust and update their viewpoints. For the Italians, the building of a great Roman empire must be captured on film for the Ethiopian resistance, gender lines must be blurred for a greater chance of success.In her afterword, Mengiste notes that recollections of the war tend to cohere around the heroism of the outnumbered Ethiopian soldiers, “stoic and regal like my grandfather”. It was only much later that she discovered that her great-grandmother had taken her father’s gun and gone to war herself – one of the women whose stories “even today have remained no more than errant lines in faded documents”. Her achievement in The Shadow King is to bring to life those women, and to depict them as dynamic entities, their capabilities, limitations and beliefs evolving under duress in as fully complex a way as those of their male counterparts.• The Shadow King is published by Canongate (RRP £16.99).

South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

Pupils told her they had been put in isolation over minor uniform breaches or the wrong hairstyle.Longfield is also concerned that isolation is being used by some schools as a “gateway” to exclusions and that it affects disproportionately high numbers of children with special educational needs.Last week, the Centre for Mental Health charity warned that putting challenging pupils in isolation for extended periods at school could harm their mental health and that young people who had already suffered trauma were particularly vulnerable.But some in the education sector back the the use of isolation for disruptive children. The government’s behaviour tsar for England, Tom Bennett, recently told the  that “removal rooms” were used so children could learn in a safe, calm environment.“They aren’t isolation rooms – I’ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They’re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,” he said.Other headteachers say the use of well-run isolation rooms means lessons are disruption-free for other children. Ruth Robinson, a school leader from Swindon, explained on Twitter that at her school 10-15 out of 900 students on average spent the day in the school’s isolation room, though booths were not used.“The impact of this approach is that every single lesson taught at the school is disruption-free. No teacher is ever talked over. Pupils are not rude. Pupils don’t refuse to work. This system is strict but it isn’t draconian. It works because it’s fair and because everyone understands it.”In an interview with the , Longfield said: “I get lots of anecdotal evidence, lots of kids and some parents, telling me about the awful experience they have had in isolation and isolation booths.“I get to hear about children who have spent long periods of time in isolation rooms. They have told us that they find it distressing and degrading. They said they feel like they are being warehoused in isolation, and they say sometimes it’s for days or weeks at a time.“I was told of a school where they were converting a toilet section into isolation booths – and the comment there was it was very handy because they had already got the cubicles.”Longfield said she had also heard of schools where teachers were having their classrooms taken away because more booths were wanted, “and I heard of one bizarre example of how they had a kind of portable booth which was a cardboard booth which they just put over the child wherever they were sitting”.There are no official figures, but one BBC investigation said more than 200 pupils had spent at least five straight days in isolation areas in schools in England in 2017. A “Lose the Booths” conference has been organised for next weekend to encourage headteachers to remove booths and employ better practices.John Procter of Corporate Office Furniture, which sells isolation booths, said about 50 schools had acquired units from him over the last five years. In the last three months alone, around eight schools have bought around 100 units, each costing £175.“It’s not cruel,” said Procter. “These people who say it’s wrong, they need to spend a day in a school and see actually what these teachers have to go through. The teachers have not signed up to being abused.”Many in the sector say a distinction should be drawn between isolation rooms and the use of confined booths, in which children have to face the wall and cannot communicate with each other. They say there is also a balance to be struck between the needs of challenging pupils and those who want to work without distraction.But Longfield said she was concerned that there may be a link between the use of isolation and exclusions. “Often parents, especially those with children with special educational needs, will talk to me about how their children are always being put in isolation booths.“Some children have said they even just sleep in the booths. In fact, one child even said: ‘Oh well, they’re not that bad,’ – they get to have a sleep.”The government is due to publish fresh guidance later this year on managing behaviour and the use of isolation rooms and exclusions. “All kids have a right to a good education and if they are being removed from a classroom and put into isolation they are not getting their education,” said Longfield. “I’m being told that some children are put in isolation because they have their hair in the wrong style or they have forgotten something or they are wearing some part of the uniform that isn’t right. I don’t want kids put into isolation about that.”Longfield said she accepted there needed to be quiet areas outside the classrooms where children could calm down. “But what I’m concerned about is when those isolation booths seem to be booming in some schools and when those periods of isolation outside the classroom become very much the norm and when they are being abused.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Schools may choose to use in-school units, whether that be to provide additional support to vulnerable pupils, or as a sanction to remove pupils with challenging behaviour from the classroom.“Our guidance is clear, however, that use of isolation must comply with pupil safeguarding and welfare requirements. Pupils are not to be kept in isolation longer than necessary and their time spent there must be as constructive as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c636822a4eaa9d96e13f3e88881b8af680166e/404_0_4738_2844/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa3e16c2c0012feee02b988d25f81096","title":"free period products to be available in schools and colleges in england","story":"State scheme starts from Monday as part of government bid to tackle ‘period poverty’Tampons, sanitary pads and other period products will be made freely available to all state schools and colleges in England starting next week, with the launch of a scheme funded by the Department for Education.The scheme follows the government’s commitment last year to pay for sanitary products for primary and secondary schools, in an effort to tackle “period poverty”, which can cause girls from low-income families to missschool.“We know that it is not easy for everyone to access period products where and when they need them. This scheme will deal with those problems so young people can go about their daily lives without getting caught out,” said Michelle Donelan, the children and families minister.The DfE said the scheme was designed “to give pupils easy access to period products at school or college” as well as breaking down stigmas and raising awareness around menstruation.Amika George, the founder of Free Periods who began campaigning to end period poverty in 2017, said: “We ask that schools have open conversations with students about what they need and start signing up to the scheme – no child must miss out.“Free products in schools will ensure that every child can learn and be their very best, without periods holding them back.”Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said more than 137,000 pupils missed school in 2018 because of their period. “No girl in the UK should miss out on education because they can’t afford these essential products,” McNeil said.The scheme is to cost up to £20m this year for an estimated 1.7 million students. From Monday, staff will be able to order products from a commercial supplier, PHS group, awarded the contract by the DfE after a tender last year.The range available to more than 20,000 schools and colleges includes environmentally friendly pads and reusable products, the company said.The government initially pledged to provide sanitary products to all state secondary schools and colleges in last year’s spring statement. But the coverage was extended after campaigners pointed out menstruation began for many girls during their time at primary school.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, applauded the government’s effort to extend provision to all schools.“We’d urge the government to monitor the new scheme closely, so that if take-up numbers are low initially, then more can be done to advertise the service and to guarantee that every pupil can access a period product that meets their needs,” Whiteman said.The scheme in England follows a groundbreaking 2018 decision by the Scottish government to fund free menstrual products to young people in schools, colleges and universities across Scotland, after a survey found that one in four struggled to obtain tampons or pads.The Welsh government followed last year, offering free products to all state schools and colleges. NHS England also announced that women and girls in hospital would receive free sanitary products on request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c933055d3ffef649cbba7ce04a25cf80e43ea24c/643_190_2857_1715/master/2857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f0d23b70d8a32d0593ab631b222c2a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including an iguana and an injured leopard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea334c49b6cccef4b3f4727229dd1d6c51c5aabb/0_69_3575_2144/master/3575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eeb2750298efd8fac28972a7dc68eee","title":"jean paul gaultier bows out as fashion designer after 50 years","story":"Gaultier says his high-end fashion and perfume business will continue along with a new concept as yet to be revealedThe renowned designer Jean-Paul Gaultier is bowing out from creating clothes after a 50-year career, he has said. But he has told fans not to worry, because he will be turning his hand to other creative projects.While his high-end fashion and perfume business will continue, Gaultier will take a step back from designing garments, he said. The designer tweeted the news in a video post on Friday, saying his next Paris show, on Wednesday, will be his last.“I’m going to give you a scoop,” he was filmed saying in a jokey telephone conversation, done as if speaking to a journalist. “This will be my last haute couture show. My last Gaultier Paris show. You have to come, you can’t miss that.“But, but, but I assure you: Gaultier Paris will continue, haute couture will continue. I have a new concept I’ll tell you about it later, I’ll tell you all the little secrets. But it is going to continue.”His irreverent style and provocative reputation brought him both fame and contempt from other fashion designers. In 2018, for instance, he produced a tongue-in-cheek fashion range inspired by cigarettes.In recent years he dropped more regular collections, focusing on producing one-of-a-kind ranges presented during haute couture fashion weeks in Paris.His brand confirmed that his plans to step back related only to his fashion and perfume business.Gaultier, 67, stopped designing ready-to-wear clothes in 2015 to concentrate on haute couture – handmade clothes that only the world’s richest people can afford.But, as late as last year, he insisted he had no intention of putting down his scissors, although he despaired of animal rights activists pressuring him to stop using furs.A teenage prodigy who rose to fame in the 1980s, when the Paris fashion scene was at its most decadent, Gaultier also carved out a parallel television career as the co-presenter of a ribald series, Eurotrash.In 2018, he staged his own hit cabaret show based loosely on his life story, called Fashion Freak Show, which opened at the Folie Bergère in Paris.A spokeswoman for Gaultier’s brand said that the designer would be back. But, like the veteran Japanese clothes creator Kenzō Takada, who has moved into interior design, it would be in other areas of creativity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c8cbd24a52203b06bd6cb462bc05284980e250c/896_391_3718_2231/master/3718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f293b04acf8ce4fb64ef3be4051b7db","title":"the best gel manicures","story":"Shellac and gel won’t wreck your nails if they are good quality and removed properly – I’ve got the method down patTwo friends tell me that one of their new year’s resolutions is taking a break from gels and ultraviolet lamp-cured, soak-off nail polishes. That’s because, despite the dramatic global increase in salon gel manicures, thanks to an instantly dry, super-shiny finish that lasts up to three weeks instead of the traditional three to five days (seriously, it’s a bleak time for regular polish brands), there’s a pervading belief that gels ultimately “wreck your nails”.This is only a tiny bit true, in that all manicures involving repeated filing and exposure to solvents will weaken the nails in the long term: the issue is not with gels per se. What does damage gel-polished nails specifically is picking, peeling and other heavy-handed removal, or poor application (including excessive roughening of the nail surface) that later requires it.Good gels should need only a light buffing with a nail file to disturb the glaze, followed by a soak in acetone, then some gentle, relatively effortless lifting with either an orange stick or a blunt scraper. If your manicurist gets out a sharp, curved metal pusher or (heaven forfend, but I’ve been there) an electric rotary file, stop them immediately and never return.

For me, however, vegetables are the biggest winners from a long, warm bath of oil and aromatics. In the process (which isn’t actually that long with veg), they tenderise and soak up a bunch of flavours that make them rich, unctuous and delicious. It’s a total transformation of something mild and humble into something rich and luxurious. All they then need is a spot of acidity or a touch of heat, and you’ve got glorious vegetables, reimagined, on the table.This is a sort of vegan equivalent of steak and mash. The oil the mushrooms are cooked in turns into something similar to harissa, with a deep, umami flavour and a real kick, so leave out the red chilli if you prefer less heat. This will make more oil than you need: keep any excess in a sealed container in the fridge, for spooning over grilled veg or meat.The mash can be warmed up or served at room temperature.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4 as a mainFor the mushrooms8 medium to large portobello mushrooms (about 650g), stems removed10 garlic cloves, peeled1 onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges1½ tbsp chipotle chilli flakes1 red chilli 4 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar2 tbsp tomato paste400ml olive oil1 tbsp flaked sea saltFor the puree500g freshly cooked or good-quality jarred butter beans (drained weight)1½ tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp olive oil½ tsp flaked saltHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)335Fgas 3. Put the mushrooms domed side up in a large, ovenproof saucepan for which you have a lid, and arrange the garlic and onion in and around them. Add all the remaining mushroom ingredients, then cover with a piece of greaseproof paper, push it down gently to cover the mix, then top the pan with a lid. Bake for an hour, then remove the pan, turn over the mushrooms, replace the paper and lid, and bake for 20 minutes more, or until the mushrooms are very tender but not falling apart. Use a pair of tongs to transfer the mushrooms to a board, cut them in half and set aside.Use a spoon to lift the onion, garlic and chilli (discard the stem) out of the oil – don’t worry if you scoop up some of the spices and oil, too – put in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth. Return the onion mixture and mushroom halves to the saucepan, put on a medium-high heat and cook for five minutes, so all the flavours come together.Meanwhile, make the puree by blitzing all the bean ingredients in a food processor with two tablespoons of water, until completely smooth. If you prefer a warm mash, transfer to a saucepan and heat gently.Divide the puree between four plates, top each portion with four mushroom halves and generously spoon over the oil and its solids.This dish is made special by the complex sweetness and depth of Shaoxing wine, a Chinese wine fermented from rice that you can now find in large supermarkets and most Asian food stores – if you can’t get it, use pale dry sherry instead. Get ahead by cooking the shallots, garlic, chestnuts and grapes a day ahead, and leave them to sit in the liquid in the fridge overnight, but don’t roast the sprouts until the day.

Put the first five ingredients in a large 34cm x 26cm, high-sided roasting tin, then add 100ml oil, 75ml rice wine and two tablespoons of soy sauce. Cover tightly with foil and roast for 35 minutes, until the shallots are soft but still hold their shape. Stir in the grapes, cover again with foil, cook for 10 minutes more, then remove from the oven, discard the foil and set aside the tin while you roast the sprouts.Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Toss the sprouts in two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, then spread them out on two oven trays lined with baking paper. Roast for 16 minutes, switching the position of the trays halfway through, until browned, then tip the sprouts into the shallot tin, gently mix everything together and leave, uncovered, at room temperature for an hour, ideally, and at least 30 minutes, to give the flavours time to develop.Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the chillies, rice vinegar, sugar and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, and leave to pickle for at least 30 minutes.Once the sprouts have sat for a while, stir in the remaining teaspoon of rice wine and two tablespoons of soy sauce, and the parsley, and transfer to a large, shallow bowl. Top with the pickled chillies and their pickling liquid, and serve.These parsnips are intensely flavoured with vinegar, chilli and smoke from the grill, which adds a wonderful dimension but isn’t strictly essential, so skip the charring stage if you want to save time.

The only season that could conceivably beat this one came last year, when they did not win the title – a reminder that statistics must always be considered in context. Greatness lies not only in numbers.And in a world in which Juventus can dispense with their manager after five successive league titles, and Barcelona sack theirs after two straight titles while top of the table, in which 95+ points has come to seem standard for a Premier League champion, it’s as well to be aware that domination of a domestic league does not mean quite the same thing that it did in the past.This should not be seen as in any sense diminishing what this Liverpool side are doing, particularly given a net spend of only around £70m over the past four years and the fact they have had to overcome a brilliant Manchester City rather it is to say the financial structures of modern football have inflated the gap between top and bottom, through wage bills even more than transfer spending. Even allowing for changes in the size of the league and the number of points for a win, 95 points is easier to achieve than it would have been in the days of Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley or Kenny Dalglish.All of which is a slightly long-winded way of pointing out that different eras have different tariffs and that greatness comes in many forms. The modern idea of Liverpool was created by Shankly. When he took over the club in 1959, it may only have been 12 years since their previous league title but they had been in the Second Division for five years and had been knocked out of the FA Cup the previous season by non-league Worcester City. He improved Anfield and the training ground, developed a style of play and put together a squad who gained promotion in 1962 and won the title in 1964. It was the following season, though, when Shankly’s first great Liverpool probably reached their peak when they beat Leeds after extra time in the FA Cup final.The image of Shankly was of a great motivator, someone with the charisma and will to build a club and bring a city (or half of it) with him. But that side were also tactically innovative, playing what was effectively a prototype 4-4-2, although with genuine wingers in Ian Callaghan and Peter Thompson. It was not necessarily a popular way to play, as was made clear by the Mirror’s report on the final, a clash of two sides who had long abandoned the traditional W-M. “More and more clubs,” wrote Ken Jones, “are turning to method and discipline … there was a certain hypnotic element about the whole thing. The fascination lay in trying to assess which side would first break the stalemate.”But that was the direction football was taking. Contemporary reporters may have been appalled by the spectacle but a modern observer would see nothing especially unusual about the game, other than perhaps to note that it feels more similar in style to modern football than to, say, the final of seven years earlier when a Nat Lofthouse-inspired Bolton had beaten Manchester United. Shankly’s first great side broke new ground for the club and they did it in a way that laid down the template for Liverpool for a little over a quarter of a century.Liverpool always tended to efficiency rather than flamboyance but that did not mean they didn’t have their moments of transcendence. Perhaps the best Shankly performance was the last, when his second great side, who had won the league and Uefa Cup the previous season, outplayed Newcastle in the 1974 FA Cup final. As Borussia Mönchengladbach had found in the Uefa Cup final a year earlier, Liverpool could physically overpower opponents but Newcastle were beaten at Wembley by a team playing extraordinary pass-and-move football.Shankly’s retirement that summer was at least partially motivated by a sense it couldn’t get any better than that. In 15 years he had built two great sides, the first a remorseless machine that laid the foundations for everything that followed, the second a more flexible unit ready for the European domination subsequently enjoyed under Paisley, who had probably been leading most of the tactical development behind the scenes anyway.It’s a mark of how sustained the success was during Paisley’s time in charge – six league titles, three European Cups and a Uefa Cup in nine seasons – that isolating his greatest team is so difficult. The greatest season, though, was probably 1978-79, when Liverpool won 30 of 42 league games and conceded only 16 goals. That was Paisley’s side pressing on the back of a well-drilled offside trap and, every now and again, dismantling opponents. They scored four on four occasions and put five past Derby, six past Norwich and, perhaps most memorably of all, seven past Tottenham, overwhelming them physically and tactically, and slicing them apart with the precision of their passing. That 1978-79 side also averaged more than two goals a game, their total of 85 eight more than any other side managed in a season that decade.That was a team who featured the organisation of the back four, the creativity of Kenny Dalglish, the wing play of Ray Kennedy, the drive of Jimmy Case, Graeme Souness and Terry McDermott and the intelligence of Steve Heighway but their greatness lies in being the apogee at the centre of a protracted period of success and so lacks the romance either of Shankly’s pioneering first great side or even his second when, having let the first team grow old together, he defied doubts to build another one.From that second great Shankly side until 1990, Liverpool’s dominance was barely challenged, reaching another peak in 1987-88 with Dalglish’s more attacking team, built around the creativity of three signings – John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and Ray Houghton. That side produced their signature performance with the 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest, a game that, in hindsight, bears an end-of-era feel. Dalglish had moved Liverpool away from their method – perhaps a necessary step as the game changed – and for 30 years they were never quite so good again.The Rafael Benítez years produced arguably the most memorable occasion in Liverpool’s history but the beauty of the 2005 Champions League final, even leaving aside the comeback, was that it was so unexpected. It was the greatness of the underdog rather than of a team who could claim to be one of the greatest of all time. Which was only reasonable given the financial constraints under which Benítez was operating.So to Klopp. Although Liverpool had not won the title in 25 years when he was appointed, he was taking over a side firmly entrenched in the upper reaches of the Premier League. There was no need to contrive a way of watering the grass at Anfield as Shankly had the foundations may have been well hidden but they were there. But that perhaps is more significant when assessing the greatness of the job Klopp has done rather than of the side he has produced.And this is a very great side, one that essentially updates the principles of Paisley’s best team, pressing opponents and then cutting them apart with rapid passing moves. This side are less inclined to kill games but that is the nature of modern football law changes and the increasing financial disparity between the elite and the rest have made the superclubs more attacking, particularly at full-back.Having conceded 14 goals this season, Liverpool will almost certainly not match the defensive record of 1978-79, despite their run of six straight clean sheets, but they will probably score more goals their goal difference with 17 games remaining is +36, so the +69 of Paisley’s team is within reach. Since last March, the present team have been relentless, a winning machine, but Paisley’s side had longevity, sustained success at home and abroad, which may yet come for Klopp.But as to who would win a one-off game, making all requisite adjustments for fitness, nutrition and changes in the laws? Well, you’d want to watch it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0f1cdff0addcc3446b5f5406c3e2a4c60b96ada/94_107_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46797d2cd8b932d13967f89841708250","title":"meghan gets more than twice as many negative headlines as positive","story":" analysis appears to support claim Duchess of Sussex receives more critical treatment than Duchess of CambridgeThe Duchess of Sussex gets more than twice as many negative headlines as positive ones, according to  analysis of articles published between May 2018 and mid January 2019.The main analysis is based on articles which appeared in the news and comment sections of 14 UK print editions where the accompanying headline included the terms “Meghan”, “Meg” or “Sussex” between 18 May 2018 - the day before the Sussex’s wedding - and 14 January 2020 and were sourced from ClipShare.Articles were categorised by three iniduals as “positive”, “negative” or “neutral” depending on the tone of the headline and article the phrasing of the story.An equivalent search covering the same time period was carried out to capture headlines which included the terms “Kate”, “Catherine” or “Cambridge”.The findings come as the couple plan their exit from the “senior” ranks of British royalty. Claims that their period of transition is soon to begin, backed by reports on Friday that staff at their Frogmore Cottage home were being reallocated.A month-by-month breakdown shows that Meghan did receive more positive press than negative in May 2018 – the month she married Prince Harry – and in the month following.However, her honeymoon period in terms of press coverage was short lived: by July of the same year the proportion of articles that painted her in a negative light outstripped the positive.Negative spikes occurred on several occasions, particularly around the couple’s desire for privacy, especially their decision to keep details about their child’s birth and baptism private. This is when the couple were accused of wanting to have their “cake and eat it too”.A number of articles quoted sources claiming that Meghan was a “boastful”, “self-obsessed” celebrity who craved media attention, an accusation which intensified when she guest-edited an edition of British Vogue in September last year.A number of the pieces associate Meghan and her family with drugs and violence. These include articles that make claims about her nephew’s involvement with drugs, as well as claims that guests were given “party bags” of cannabis at Meghan’s first wedding. Past coverage of her family has associated Meghan’s birthplace, and mother’s home town, with gang violence.Other intense periods of negative press coverage included articles about the couple’s use of private jets and the duchess’s relationship with her father. The media returned to this topic time and again over the period covered by the analysis. Articles about her relationship with her father accounted for almost one third of the negative articles about the duchess.

The people who have done it talk emotions, legal hurdles – and WhatsApp birthing groupsIn a flat in north-east London, Abi is cradling her best friend’s baby. At 15 weeks old, the little boy is smiling up at her, testing out his first sounds. His mother, Rachel, prepares his bottle while Abi rocks him, showing all the love she would to any of her friends’ children. The only difference is that Abi gave birth to him.Abi and Rachel, both 35, met on their first day at university in Birmingham in 2003 and rarely left one another’s side. At 16, Rachel had been diagnosed with MRKH, a congenital condition meaning her uterus was undeveloped. Although she produced eggs, she would never be able to carry children, something she kept to herself. “I’d tell people I didn’t want kids but deep down I was insanely jealous,” says Rachel, who works as an events producer in London. “I wanted them so badly but assumed I’d never have my own, so I learned to live with it.” After meeting her boyfriend, Sam, at a warehouse party on the eve of 2014, she avoided the “family” chat for two years before confiding in him. “We continued our relationship knowing kids may or may not happen,” she says.A weekend stay at Abi’s home, in November 2017, bringing together five friends, their partners and kids, presented an opportunity to open up to them, too. Abi, a mother to three boys, remembers: “My partner, Rich, was cooking a curry, the kids were asleep and we were sitting around the kitchen table. Everyone spilled something personal. When Rachel told us about her condition, I knew, in my gut, that I would help her to have a child.”Rachel and Sam had explored IVF, surrogacy and adoption, but had dismissed using agencies, which can be vastly oversubscribed, with waits of up to two years to find a match. “It felt too impersonal too life-changing somehow,” she says. Her younger sister had yet to start her own family had she already had children, Rachel might have asked her to be a surrogate. Abi and Rich, meanwhile, “spent Christmas contemplating what being a surrogate would mean for everyone. We had been so lucky, yet one of the people I love most hadn’t,” she says. “I hate this phrase but it was a no-brainer.”She called Rachel in the new year and told her to sit down before offering to carry her baby. Rachel remembers: “She said it would be like ‘babysitting’ our embryo and that term stuck. She’d made up her mind, and that blew me away. I hadn’t told my friends expecting one of them to be the answer. When Abi offered, it felt, for the first time, as if having a child was a very real possibility.”Surrogacy is a delicate arrangement with high stakes. Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling, and present health risks, while the unknown territory of handing over a baby you have carried – or parenting the child you have not – presents added fears over bonding or changes of heart, albeit rare.When there is an existing friendship at the arrangement’s heart, the stakes can feel higher still, for both the surrogate carrying a longed-for child and parents asking such as sacrifice of someone they care for, typically with a family themselves to consider. (Medics and lawyers advise against surrogacy until women have completed their own families, citing concerns about reproductive health and fears that it would be harder for them to give up the baby.) Not surprisingly, the friendships that underpin these arrangements are life-changing.Abi, Rachel and Sam embarked on medical appointments at a London fertility clinic. The friends were invited for counselling and asked to consider everything from how they would feel if Abi backed out, to how she would feel if she gave birth to a girl, after three sons. They set up a WhatsApp group. “We left Rich off that,” Abi says. “I’ll talk about body parts and womb washing till the cows come home but he saw his role as keeping things normal – remaining practical and pragmatic in a hyper-emotional situation.” They told their families, including Abi’s boys – four, three and nine months at the time. “We always talked about ‘Rachel and Sam’s baby’. We said, ‘Rachel’s womb doesn’t work but Mummy’s does, so we’re going to look after a baby for them.’” After initially being refused any NHS fertility treatment that would lead to surrogacy, Rachel successfully lobbied her local commissioning group for a single round of IVF, in May 2018, allowing her eggs to be extracted for fertilisation by Sam’s sperm, creating a viable embryo. It would later be placed in Abi’s uterus at a private clinic, using money Rachel’s parents had saved for her wedding. “Surrogacy is still seen as something you do if you’ve got money rather than through biological need,” Rachel says.Abi was given oestrogen and progesterone, and the embryo was transferred, via catheter, in a simple, minutes-long procedure, on 2 October. “From that moment, it was out of my control,” Rachel says. “I felt like I was holding my breath.” When Abi took a pregnancy test, at 7am on a Saturday morning nearly a fortnight later, Rachel and Sam were in bed, on the end of the phone. “When she sent through a picture of the positive test, we were in total shock it was extremely emotional. We didn’t know how to get on with our day other than staring at that picture.” They remained in daily contact and Rachel travelled the 150 miles to Abi’s home for midwife appointments and scans, as well as attending antenatal classes, along with Rich. “In hindsight, the distance was a good thing,” Rachel says. “If we were round the corner, I’d have been posting steak through her letterbox.”They had to consider how to announce the pregnancy. Rachel would say: “We’re expecting a baby, but I’m not pregnant. My friend is carrying our baby.” Abi, who works in public engagement at the BBC, recalls: “Everyone’s mouths dropped at work. My mum asked, ‘Why you?’ But they all thought it was amazing.”When it came to maternity leave, Abi was entitled to a year, but took six weeks, while Rachel was entitled to a year’s adoption leave. Outdated surrogacy laws require that Abi’s name is on the birth certificate alongside Sam’s had Abi and Rich been married, he would have been named as the father. They also recognise Abi as the mother until Rachel obtains the court order granting her legal parental status. Seven months on, she is still waiting. “The fact that on paper he’s still not my son is upsetting,” she says, “but I can’t dwell on it. It’s a process, so we treat it that way.”Many surrogacy pairings put an agreement in place. Although not legally binding – it is illegal for solicitors to negotiate one – it helps mitigate against concerns over all aspects of the pregnancy, from supplements to who first holds the baby. Rachel and Abi decided against it. “If Abi had changed her mind on anything, we all would have,” Rachel says.Surrogates can receive reasonable expenses, such as extra food, travel, childcare or housekeeping costs, and Rachel and Sam gave Abi a cash card. “It’s the trickiest part because no expenses can repay her,” Rachel says. “She was militant about not asking for too much, but I wanted her to have a meal on us because she had our son with her.” The baby was born on 8 June 2019. Rachel and Sam drove Abi to the hospital and witnessed the birth. “I could hardly believe it was real,” says Rachel, who fainted as he was delivered into her arms. The couple spent the first two nights after his birth in hospital, down the corridor from Abi.“Rich was working late and arrived to find us all in the room together and the baby just minutes old,” Abi says. “He stayed for the placenta delivery, had some tea and toast and went home to be there for our boys in the morning. I don’t think the scale of what we’ve done will hit us for a long time. I’m relieved at how normal it feels when I see the baby. Rachel was so generous with her trust in me.”Rachel adds: “Abi put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for me, to make us a family. She gave up a huge part of her life during those months to change ours for ever. I couldn’t handle what I was putting her through at times but she’d always say: ‘You’re not putting me through this, I’ve chosen to do it.’ If I ever asked why, she would say: ‘Well, I can’t think why not.’”As fertility medicine has advanced and different family units evolved, surrogacy has emerged as a more familiar route to parenthood, but demand far outweighs the number of women willing or able to volunteer, and the British legal system is playing catchup. London-based family lawyer Joanna Kay, who has advised on surrogacy for more than a decade, says: “The landscape of what a family looks like has changed beyond recognition, but the laws are from the mid-80s. Without a court order, intended parents can’t make decisions about their child’s medical care or education there can be problems with passports and inheritance. I don’t think anyone would argue against the need for reform. “In most cases, everyone knows what they’re signing up for and is happy to honour their agreement. On rare occasions things go wrong and the courts are asked to intervene. There have been a handful of cases where the surrogate didn’t want to hand over the baby or the intended parent didn’t want it.”Other relationships between parents and surrogates have been deep and enduring. Kim Cotton, who became Britain’s first surrogate in 1985, went on to help her friend Linda, who was unable to carry children because of complications associated with a miscarriage Cotton gave birth to twins in 1991. “The family moved to New Zealand when the twins were teenagers but I still track their lives, mostly through Facebook now,” says Cotton, who is 63, and the founder of the Cots surrogacy agency. “Christmases and birthdays are still special and the twins and I always send messages to mark them. My friendship with Linda remains the kind where you are for ever aware of that person and can pick up with them anytime, even if you don’t speak often.”Yet even longed-for pregnancies don’t always run smoothly. After Laura was made infertile five years ago, at 28, by treatment for stage two cervical cancer, her best friend Kerrie represented her only hope of becoming a biological mother. Last year, Kerrie offered to carry Laura’s fertilised eggs, frozen before she began intensive chemo and radiotherapy five years ago.They had been friends since childhood and shared everything, Laura says, over a cup of tea at Kerrie’s home in Lancashire. “Relationships, breakups, marriages, my illness she cries with me and laughs with me,” she says.In 2014, Laura, a nursery manager, and her now-husband Grant were about to start IVF for problems unconnected to her own fertility when a routine smear test detected cancerous cells. “They talked about a hysterectomy,” she remembers. “Knowing my illness would take away my chance of having children was what broke me, not the cancer.” By this point in the story, both women are in tears. “As we left the hospital, I told Grant to leave me,” Laura adds. He didn’t. And while a hysterectomy was ruled out, Laura spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve undergoing treatment, with Kerrie by her side. She had delayed it by one month, so her eggs could be extracted and later used to try for a child via surrogate.In April 2015, a scan revealed the tumour had gone. When Grant and Laura married in Cyprus in 2016, Kerrie was a bridesmaid. “When I was ill, a few friends had offered to be a surrogate,” Laura says. “And when we finally came round to thinking about it, two years ago, it was Grant who said: ‘It has to be Kerrie.’”Kerrie, 33 and a hairdresser, had a similar conversation with her husband, Danny. “At the clinic, he told us he knew when Laura became ill that I would do it one day. I’d had two good pregnancies and it would only be nine months of my life to improve hers for ever. I focused on seeing them with a child.”Although it was NHS-funded IVF that had led to the discovery of Laura’s cancer, when surrogacy became her only option, the funding was withdrawn. “I didn’t let it go without a fight,” she says. “Ultimately they were taking it away because I had cancer. The NHS saved my life to then dictate that life isn’t fair.”In the end Laura’s family paid for her treatment. “They would have helped me with a house deposit but I said, no, give me a baby, please.” The surrogacy was delayed when Kerrie unexpectedly became pregnant with her third child in 2018, but in October 2019 Laura’s eggs were thawed. Eight had been fertilised – but only one looked viable for transfer and pregnancy. It was placed in Kerrie’s womb on 7 October. The women held hands as they sat on the clinic’s bed. “When they told us there was only one chance, I couldn’t look at Laura,” Kerrie says. “She can read my thoughts. I wanted to stay positive for her but the pressure was huge.”On 23 October, two clear lines showed on the pregnancy stick, but Kerrie tested and retested, with Laura by her side, to be sure. Both women were ecstatic. However, on 1 November Kerrie started bleeding. A miscarriage, at five weeks, was confirmed two days later at hospital.“It hit me like a ton of bricks,” Kerrie says. “I’d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence. My priority was being strong for her but I was broken. We went from speaking all day, every day, to nothing for 48 hours. I’d type a message asking, ‘Are you OK?’ then delete it. When we eventually sat down together, we cried our hearts out. I felt responsible but I knew I’d done everything I could.”Laura is still coming to terms with her grief. “I was uncontrollable, heartbroken. We each had our own grieving to do it wasn’t that we didn’t want to speak, we just didn’t have the words and didn’t want to add to each other’s pain.”Kerrie has offered to be a surrogate again, with a donor egg, but Laura says she couldn’t put her friend through it. She has also thought about adoption but needs time to heal before giving it serious consideration.“I don’t think anybody realises how difficult the process is,” she says. “Kerrie gave me my only chance of being a biological mum. I didn’t know I could love her any more than I already did.”In Kent, Kevin, 45, a chief marketing officer, and Spencer, 30, a solicitor, are getting their six-month-old son ready for bed when the other half of “Sawyer’s birthing squad” (the name they gave their pregnancy WhatsApp group) arrives: surrogate Leanne, 36, and her sister Rachael, 33, Sawyer’s egg donor. “There’s not many teams like us out there,” says Leanne, grabbing a bedtime cuddle.Spencer and Kevin have been together 10 years and married in 2015. “I told Kevin on our first date that I needed to be a dad,” Spencer says. “The biological connection was important to us. We wanted to be involved from the start.” They explored agencies but the networking aspect turned them off. “It was like speed dating. There were more couples than surrogates. It felt hard to be your true self.” They spoke to relatives and asked close friends but none provided an obvious solution. So, despite reservations, they turned to an agency and invested five months getting to know a potential surrogate, only to be let down by an early morning text weeks before treatment was due to start.The one thing they did have was an egg donor. (Medics typically discourage having the same woman perform both functions, to offset concerns around the possibility of bonding too strongly with the baby.) Spencer and Rachael, a credit controller, had become friends two years earlier after meeting on an IVF forum on Facebook. Rachael, then pregnant with her third child, was exploring egg donation, and Spencer wanted to know more about surrogacy. They lived nearby and began meeting up, forming a close friendship that involved weekends together, takeaways, dinners and days out. Spencer and Kevin became unofficial uncles to Rachael’s youngest son and joined in family celebrations, which is how they grew close to Leanne, a mental health support worker who had three sons of her own.Leanne remembers: “Kevin and Spencer were lovely, and I’d seen how close they all were and how badly the boys wanted to be parents. When Rachael told me their surrogate had let them down, I instinctively offered.”The group drew up a 12-page “intention agreement”, detailing expenses, medical tests, pregnancy supplements and protection – including life and critical illness insurance – for Leanne’s children in the event that anything went wrong. Kevin and Spencer spent £25,000: £6,000 for the cost of Rachael’s egg donation £6,500 on medical appointments, screening tests (for all four), medication and scans £2,500 to transfer their embryo to Leanne’s womb and £10,000 on surrogate expenses. On pregnancy test day, they sat around Leanne’s kitchen table together, dipping the stick in a cup she’d wee’d in.“This was the next best thing to carrying the baby ourselves,” Spencer says. “We were so involved. Friendship-first gave us trust and openness.” The expectant dads attended scans, sent hampers each trimester – the first contained ginger biscuits and tea for morning sickness – and downloaded an app that allowed them to read bedtime stories for Leanne to play to her belly. When her waters broke three months early, at 28 weeks, the responsibility weighed heavily for all. Leanne says, “You don’t want to let anything go wrong. Decisions about what happened next were theirs to make. I felt guilty.” The men felt responsible, too. “Leanne has three children she had to go home perfect at the end of this,” Spencer says.Leanne was monitored as an outpatient until labour started a month later. When Sawyer arrived, at 2.36am on 6 April, eight weeks premature and weighing 5lb, all four were in the room, Rachael as birthing partner. Sawyer spent 16 days in neonatal intensive care. His fathers stayed by his side but the now familiar outdated legalities meant Leanne had to return for his discharge.Even once they have left hospital, it is common for surrogates to be contacted by health professionals seeking consent for newborn checks, despite parents being present. Kevin remembers: “Before the birth, our consultant emailed ahead to enforce our right to be there. Some nurses called Leanne ‘Mum’ which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated. I think it’s sexuality and gender more than surrogacy. It took us being by his side for 16 days to prove ourselves, and it shouldn’t be that way.”After the birth, Leanne was flooded with emotion: “Your body doesn’t know you’re a surrogate he was premature and my natural instinct was to know he was all right. I talked a lot with Rachael to be sure what I was feeling was OK. The openness and honesty between me and the boys was vital. Once home, I was back to being Leanne again.”She expressed and froze milk for Sawyer for two weeks before returning to work. Going home from hospital, Kevin and Spencer stopped at her house, “to give her boys the first cuddle,” Spencer says. “They’d been through a lot, too.”When the friends share their story with others, it is the egg donation that tends to generate the most interest, Kevin says, but for Rachael it represented nothing more than a tiny piece of DNA. “It’s that black and white for me,” she says. “My own children are the ones I’ve created with my husband. The way Kevin and Spencer look at Sawyer is the exact reason I wanted to do this.”They see each other often and last month shared a Christmas outing and an early New Year’s Eve celebration before Sawyer’s bedtime. “I want our son to know who the two most incredible women on the planet are,” Kevin says. “They’ll for ever have that bond with him. The more love he has, the better.”Back in north-east London, Rachel and Abi echo the sentiment. As the baby goes down for his nap, the friends leaf through a photo book of their pregnancy, created for their children. “I can’t wait for my son to know how many people brought him into the world,” Rachel says. “It’s the biggest act of kindness imaginable I can never thank her enough.”Abi smiles. “But you don’t need to thank me,” she says, “because it just feels entirely normal. We were going to be friends for the rest of our lives anyway it’s just cemented our bond.” • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/526c428bfbf5e764881f83a066d4c429cb85b2e1/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fd770df4812b4a412648d3c4d2300ec","title":"blind date alex charlotte","story":"What were you hoping for?Someone to go dancing in the moonlight with.First impressions?Wow, you’re here before me despite me being 15 minutes early.What did you talk about?The dares she was doing instead of a new year’s resolution, her film review blog, trips to New Orleans.Any awkward moments?Talking about the fact that we had to write a review of our date.Good table manners?Nothing to complain about.Best thing about Charlotte?She was willing to call time straight after dessert, rather than continuing when we didn’t have a connection.

So why are fake poo peddlers finding it harder to raise a smile?I can only blame myself for my parents’ career as unwitting joke shop owners. As a child, I was preoccupied with Monty Python, and longed for a rubber chicken. I had never seen one in real life, but had a sense that it would bring boundless comedic joy.At the time, my parents already ran a retail business, and their search for a chicken led them to Ray Peckett, the owner of the UK’s largest joke and costume wholesalers, Smiffys. As family legend has it, Ray would only sell them one if they promised to open a joke shop. So they did. Three months later, painted a retina-scorching orange, and with an eight-foot, 3D comedy nose and glasses sign on Edinburgh’s Victoria Street, Aha Ha Ha Jokes and Novelties was doing a roaring trade. It is said to have become JK Rowling’s inspiration for Zonko’s joke shop in the Harry Potter series. As a teenager, I spent every weekend and school holiday working there. Manning the till under a mirror ball and a menagerie of inflatable animals, I encountered people from every walk of life. Whoopee cushions, fake turds and things that go bang have egalitarian appeal even the most prudish lady will titter at a wind-up waddling willy. You are never too old for a blue-mouth sweet. I still remember selling two fake bottoms to a man whose breath was more nose-meltingly potent than any can of fart gas.There were a few notable customers, too. Once, Glen Campbell appeared in the doorway, resplendent in full Rhinestone Cowboy get-up. Mum flogged him a twirling bow tie and a stick-on third eye. An Oscar-winning director bought the shop’s entire stock of whoopee cushions, for reasons unknown.Today, the shop has barely changed the fake handcuffs and glow-in-the-dark bone maracas still hang next to the “giant mistake” novelty erasers. The most popular celebrity masks are no longer Margaret Thatcher and Mr Bean, but Donald Trump and superheroes. There’s a fair amount of schoolboy wizard-related items, and a certain 1960s bucktooth gigolo is still popular.People always laugh when I tell them my parents own a joke shop, but it’s a very serious business. The slow strangulation of the high street, the failing pound, Amazon and a generation of people who are happy to shop directly from their phones mean that the past few years have been difficult. After 26 years, my parents have decided to sell up and retire – but hope that the new owner continues to run it as a joke shop.How much do we still need them? In these distinctly unhumorous times, I set out to meet other joke shop owners determined to keep looking on the funny side.Coming into our shop is like going back in time. I display the stock in old boxes from the 1930s, 40s and 50s we don’t carry that stock any more, but people like to look at it and remember. People tell me about coming in when they were kids – it’s just a lovely memory for them. When younger people come in, they ask, “How much is that?” and then find it for £2 cheaper on the internet. I have a little eBay shop, but I do think we’ve been left behind a bit. I just can’t compete online.I like to meet customers and give them a bit of silly patter. Anything I sell, I go into character. If someone buys Elvis glasses, I’ll start talking like Elvis – I can’t help it. My kids find it a bit embarrassing. When we used to go on holiday, my son and I would put in false teeth and wear them out to restaurants. My daughter would be mortified, but you have to have fun. There used to be an old chap who would come in and buy clown noses: he just always wore one, everywhere he went. Even his bus pass had a picture of him wearing one. Back in the day, Tommy Cooper used to come in: he never bought magic tricks, but he did buy props for his show.Making people laugh is good. Grandad Dinsdale opened this shop 90 years ago. I’ve been running it for about 20 years, but I’m not going to celebrate our 90th birthday we’ll just quietly plod on. I always thought it would go on for ever, because kids would always want to spend their pocket money in a joke shop, but the past five years have been very difficult. I keep hearing of other joke shops closing down. All the shops in Hull have gone from the main shopping area – we’ve just lost M\u0026ampS and Boots. It can be demoralising on days when nobody comes in.Uncle George Dinsdale, who took over from Grandad, used to say that coming into the joke shop was like going to the doctor’s. Laughter keeps you healthy. Uncle George is still involved. One day we were chatting on the phone and a man walked in and said, “I bought a magic book off Mr Dinsdale in 1954, and he said if I wanted to bring it back he would give me a refund.” The man said he paid ten shillings, so Uncle George said, “I remember him, go in the till and give him 50p.” Recently, a man came in who had grown up in Hull but moved to Canada. He was with his son and showed him all the magic tricks he used to buy. He was so happy that we were still here after all this time. I was thinking, “Come on, spend a little bit of money.” The magic tricks were £2, but they left without buying anything at all.Mum and Dad had a shell shop about 50 years ago, but they always sold Kiss Me Quick hats and little novelty items. By 1977, they had opened a joke shop in the arcade, and next door they opened a bong shop. We moved both premises into one big shop nine years ago.I don’t think the function of a joke shop has ever changed. People’s sense of humour hasn’t changed. The whoopee cushion was invented 100 years ago and it is still funny. What has changed is fancy dress costumes: young people want to look unique, and there’s some things they just won’t buy, like Native American costumes. There’s been a few things that have been banned. We used to sell this thing you’d poke in a cigarette and it would make the ash “snow”. It said “harmful by inhalation” on the packet, and that got banned quite quickly. I sell a £1.50 retractable knife and I wonder when that will die out – it’s not a funny thing to pretend to plunge a knife into someone.I had cancer a few years ago and I had to let go of our general manager. So now my two adult nephews can do split shifts between the joke shop and the bong shop. I am going to keep the business going as long as possible – the joke shop can’t close on my watch. My nephews are going to take it over, hopefully. I have a daughter, but she’s only eight and I’m not sure what a joke shop will be doing in 10 years’ time.Margate has changed quite a lot recently: it’s got pretty cool, but I don’t think it’s affected our takings. Amazon and eBay are our biggest threat. I love it when people say they’ve bought something from eBay and not realised it will take 16 weeks to ship from China.I always joke that a joke shop is a non-profit organisation. It ebbs and flows. We do have times that are really busy, like Halloween, book week, Easter and New Year’s Eve. It can be stressful, but not as stressful as the seafood bar I used to run. The best bit is when a little kid comes in and spends an hour choosing something for 50p, and the worst days are when I don’t take a bean.We specialise in everything. I have over 3,000 lines of stock. The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos. Anything disgusting, kids love. We have a disgruntled 80s pop star who comes in regularly and buys stink bombs. I think he breaks them in places he doesn’t like. One of my customers came in and said she had to stop buying stuff: she’d given her dad such a fright that he’d jumped up out of his chair and had a stroke. She’d played every prank on him, but in the end it was an electric-shock pen that got him.I read something that said “always know your target audience”, but our audience is everyone of every age. The only people we don’t appeal to are probably young women – I don’t think a clown horn is interesting to them. They buy costumes, but glamorous ones. We used to have a lot of little old ladies come in, then we had a lot of stag and hen dos. But they don’t really come to Blackpool any more it’s a lot more family-oriented now.The town itself is in disarray. There’s not another shop open on our street. We’re not on the promenade, but people still make the effort to come in. We have Chucky painted on the back of the shop and a clown on the side, so a lot of people take photos, too. The council wants to regenerate this area, and they want to buy back our lease. But what they have offered us won’t cover rent for a shop in town. It would be the end of us, and I’m not trained to do anything else.Things move in trends. People used to want to be a witch, but we haven’t sold a witch for 10 years. It was always a witch or a devil costume, then it was zombies and vampires. Halloween is our busiest time it’s also half-term so we get all the schoolkids coming in. We don’t do a stock take. We never started out doing one, so we’ve never done it. If something doesn’t sell, we laugh about it. Joke purchases are very impulsive, and that doesn’t translate to internet shopping. You can’t really sell a shocking pen online. It’s the whole impulse of going into the shop, seeing the shocking pen, laughing about it and thinking, “I’m going to go home and trick someone with this.” You don’t need a shocking pen, but you go home with two. But nothing surprises young people any more – they’ve seen it all on YouTube. It’s a shame, for them.My dad ran a flower shop in 1978, and someone gave him a box of jokes. He put them on the counter and they sold out. We still have the same counter. I’ve got three daughters, and two of them work here with me. I encouraged them to do other things, but they want to work here. There’s never a dull moment. Our motto is: if you can’t take a joke, don’t come in.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5f94967d5ea69b65e4634af6ec8c84c244daf7/0_0_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eaaf5576d0d4e36dabdf17d933288ff","title":"tim dowling its day two of the silent treatment can i keep it up","story":"I stopped talking to my wife when she told me she’d thrown out my drawing boardI am not speaking to my wife, although I concede she has no real way of knowing this. I’m in my office shed, working and not speaking to her, and she’s inside, oblivious.I have not been speaking to her since she paid someone to come and take away the junk stacked under the covered bit of our side return: an old shelving unit, a couple of redundant light fittings, a broken chair, a dismantled pallet and my drawing board.We brought the drawing board in off the street 30 years ago, and carried it home. I put it up in a corner of the bedroom and used it to draw cartoons and illustrations. You could say that’s how I made my living back then, except I didn’t quite. At some point, I decided it was better to be a failed writer than a failed cartoonist, because the overheads were lower.I hung on to the drawing board, but when we moved house there didn’t seem to be any space for it. My shed was too small. I can see what my wife thought: if it’s been sitting outside for two years, he can’t have missed it. But I missed it every day. Whenever I walked by it, I renewed my plan to smuggle it into the house. When my wife told me it was gone, I found myself close to tears. Over the course of the afternoon I experienced a cascade of complex, competing emotions.Fortunately, I’ve discovered that there are no emotions that cannot be converted, for simplicity’s sake, into anger. I seethed for a while, but seething is a lot of work if no one is around to watch. Eventually, I fell silent.On Friday, the second day of not talking to my wife, I find myself sitting across the table from my oldest son, who is staring at his laptop. My wife walks in.“Are you here for supper?” she says to the oldest one.“I think so,” he says.“Decide,” she says. “We’re eating early, and then Dad and I are watching another film.”“What film?” the oldest says.“We have a choice,” she says, offering me two options. I look out the window and shrug.“Wait,” she says. “Are you still not speaking?” I shake my head ruefully, while staring at my hands.“Not speaking about what?” the oldest says.“Because I threw away his stupid drawing board,” my wife says. “How long is this meant to go on for?”“I suppose it will always be there, hanging between us,” I say. I think: stop talking! The oldest one snorts.“Don’t you laugh,” my wife says. “I got rid of all your stuff as well.”By 8pm, my wife and I are halfway through our movie, part of our January festival of film and not drinking. Some of the films are on TV anyway, some are streamed and some, like this one, are on actual DVDs. As I sit brooding in the dark, the main character gets shot and the screen goes black. A minute later, it is still black.“Is this part of it?” my wife says. I shrug, but she can’t see.“I think it’s just our crappy DVD player,” I say, finally.“What do we do?” she says. Normally, I would just shout upstairs for someone to come and fix it, but all the children are out. It’s our technological problem. I stare at the stack of black boxes beneath the TV.“Theoretically, it should be possible to play a DVD through that games console,” I say.“Do it, then,” my wife says.“I can’t even turn it on,” I say. “There are no buttons.” The console has a perfectly blank facade, like a scale model of an evil empire’s corporate HQ. I poke random spots until a light flashes and a DVD tray slides out.“OK,” I say.My wife and I spend 15 minutes crouching on the floor, forehead to forehead, trying different configurations of wires. Eventually we get the console connected to the screen, and I manage to navigate to the shooting scene using a joystick. The film continues.“Well done,” my wife says. “I would have given up.”I take my seat in the dark and think: back to the drawing board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a86bd73c3d306d7f8f8457bbff85e51489acc06/0_345_3624_2174/master/3624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ecc5817f4356625b414da235a836824","title":"why women should date short men","story":"I used to prefer dating tall men, but now I’m urging women to start lowering their height expectations This week, the actor Jameela Jamil said she wants to see less dating stereotypes on screen. Instead of the usual pretty-women-meets-handsome-man trope, she wants to see love between able-bodied and disabled characters, mixed-race love and, why not, tall women with short men.It is with much shame that I admit to having been one of those women: the ones who judge the attractiveness of a partner as proportional to his height. My old online dating bio used to carry the tagline “six foot and above only”.It does seem like short kings – the internet’s pet name for short men – are having a moment. Ever since the comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined the term in 2018 (“We are valid. We are strong. We are at a lower risk of heart disease,” he joked on Twitter) there has been more space to talk about short men being desirable. Why not extend this newfound acceptance of short men to the big screen?Now, I know what you’re all thinking – there is such a dearth of ersity on screen, should this really be the hill we die on? But consider this: our obsession over tall men is related to patriarchy.Take the movies in which mixed-height couples do appear. In Shallow Hal, Gwyneth Paltrow (5ft 9in) towers over Jack Black (5ft 6in). The premise of that movie (man gets hypnotized so he doesn’t realize he is dating an overweight woman) tells us something about the rules of attraction in a patriarchal world: a short man can date a tall woman, but only if she is fat (and he is tricked into it).In the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence (5ft 9in) plays Katniss Everdeen, who is taller than her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, 5ft 7in). Peeta’s character is soft: he’s a bread-baker who hides from conflict rather than facing it. He can’t compete with Everdeen’s best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth, 6ft 3in) who hunts and blows things up. At the end of the movie, Gale indirectly kills Katniss’s sister, which should probably be a lesson to us all about toxic masculinity.If the problem with toxic masculinity is that it idolizes men for all those things that pointlessly connote masculinity without equating to it – violence, machismo, confidence – then why not consider height in this equation?People constantly (and wrongly) equate height with masculinity. Men who are taller get promoted more, paid more and are considered better leaders. CEOs have an average height over 6ft. Presidential candidates who are taller are preferred (except in France, it seems).Height is an unattainable beauty standard for short men – what are they supposed to do, grow?Come on, feminists: to accept that there are conventional male beauty standards doesn’t undermine our cause, it elevates it. Patriarchy isn’t just a standard that entraps women, it’s a standard that entraps everyone. This year, let’s spotlight the worth of our short kings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598ca83dd2132eb03b56f57d178a6adff48c4a01/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f063b806ec5053d0fd72068f581fb7c","title":"i should love little women hadley freeman","story":"The novel was one of my favourites as a child.

Instead, I feel bad about Little Women.The reviews of Greta Gerwig’s film adaptation have been universally adoring. “Superb,” said Empire. “One-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive,” agreed The Observer. Liking the film is now considered as much a part of being a thoughtful modern woman as supporting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Because this movie isn’t just good, people wrote with urgency on social media – it’s important. It’s about women and creativity and it stars women – four of them! It’s an adaptation of one of the greatest women’s novels, done by Gerwig, who, like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was decreed by The Council of General Consensus to be An Excellent Thing. As Marmee says in the book, “I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!”So I went to the cinema, as excited as if I were going on a Tinder date with Prince Charming. Hell, the algorithm guaranteed a happy ending. Louisa May Alcott’s novel was one of my favourites as a child, and like every bookish girl (what other kind reads Little Women?), I over-empathised with Jo March, the tomboy who dreams of being a writer. Also, I hugely enjoyed Lady Bird, Gerwig’s previous movie with Saoirse Ronan, who plays Jo in this version. So this film could not be more up my boulevard if it was my actual house and I lived in it.But to paraphrase another 19th-century novel much-loved by women, Reader, I did not love Little Women. Despite all the excitement, it looks as twee as the many other previous adaptations, while being more safe in the way it plays to the gallery. At the risk of being a Little Woman hipster (although all those homespun dresses they wear are quite hipster), every time someone coos over Ronan’s interpretation of Jo as an independent spirit, I can hear Katharine Hepburn, who played Jo in the 1933 version, hacking off her own hair in disgust.Much has been made of the way Gerwig has blended Alcott’s biography into the novel, ending the film with Jo publishing Little Women. This allows the director to fudge the storyline even more than she does by making Prof Bhaer, who Jo ends up marrying, a young and dishy Frenchman – as opposed to the old and ugly German he is in the book. This might be more satisfying for Jo fans, but it sands down Jo’s oddness. If Gerwig were going to change something about Bhaer, I wish she’d changed how Jo falls for him when he says her stories are rubbish. (It is amazing how many novels feature a woman getting turned on by a man telling her off, from Emma to Jane Eyre to Fifty Shades. As messages go, I’d like this to go in the bin, alongside girls being told that, when a boy pulls their hair, it means he likes them.)The novel ends with Jo and her husband opening a boys’ school, which doesn’t have quite the same feminist, inidualist punch as publishing one’s own book. But imposing modern attitudes on canonical characters in the belief they must be relatable is just lazy. This happens a lot with the Bennet sisters in Pride And Prejudice, and here with the March sisters. A good literary adaptation brings us to the characters, not the other way round in Emma Thompson’s Sense And Sensibility, Thompson and Kate Winslet don’t wang on about “the marriage economy”, as Gerwig’s Little Women do. Instead, we see how we would have thought in the 19th century. Because it’s one thing to fantasise that we are Jo, and quite another to fantasise that Jo is us. This tendency to overrelate to any fictional character, whether it’s Jo or Fleabag, is less about art and more about narcissism. We don’t have to make everything about ourselves.I am an enthusiast, and being cynical when everyone else is cheering is territory as unknown to me as the moon. If I don’t like Gerwig’s Little Women, who even am I for heaven’s sake? As I left the cinema, I was reminded of a time when a bunch of friends fixed me up with someone they knew I’d love. He was a book editor! And Jewish! But I rejected him, and they despaired – what more could I want? Sometimes ideas you love in theory crash on the rocks of reality.And sometimes they’re just overfamiliar. The trailers before Little Women were for the upcoming films of Emma and The Secret Garden. But there are many other great books about women – Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Zadie Smith’s On Beauty – that are less cosy, less white and have not been turned into a film a thousand times before. As the March sisters say, when bemoaning their poverty in the book: no one likes to see the same old dresses again and again.I didn’t marry the Jewish book editor – instead, I went off and had a fling with someone who was neither of those things. Similarly, I didn’t love Little Women, but instead fell for the next film I saw, Uncut Gems, an Adam Sandler thriller, of all unlikely genres. We don’t always want the dishy young French guy. Sometimes we surprise ourselves and prefer the ugly old German."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b29f8665719a7bcd97bff51c41f54c42dabb2a/0_94_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba510dcf2ed597b8ddfd3164dc8e56","title":"share your experiences of once in a lifetime jobs","story":"After hundreds apply to run a café on a remote Irish island, we’d like to hear about your one-of-a-kind job experiences Do you dream of quitting the rat race and moving to a remote island to run a B\u0026ampB, book shop or animal sanctuary?

Researchers have produced gadgets such as gastric balloons that break down when light from a swallowable LED shines upon them.The team say the approach could be extended to a broader range of medical equipment, as well as offering a new approach to delivering drugs to the right location at the right time.“We have the ability to control when those devices break up through the application of light,” said Giovanni Traverso, co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital in the US.At the heart of the approach is a hydrogel – a squishy, water-absorbing material made of polymers.“You can imagine that if you put something really stiff and heavy and rigid inside your body, the rest of your tissues– which are quite soft by comparison– may have a negative reaction to that,” said Ritu Raman, first author of the research who is also from MIT.However, hydrogels can be tweaked to make them stiffer or stretchier, while it is also possible to engineer them so they break down in certain environments, for example by exposure to acidity or heat.The team said they chose to use light since it was easy to control and could be used across different environments in the body, while the wavelength could be selected so it did not harm surrounding tissues.Writing in the journal Science Advances, Traverso and colleagues report how they applied their approach to gastric balloons – devices that aid weight loss by making a patient feel fuller. These are typically inserted into the stomach, inflated with a fluid and removed up to six months later – often with an endoscope.Rather than filling the balloon with fluid, the team filled the porous shell with a material that rapidly inflates when wet, and sealed it with a pin made from their specially designed light-responsive hydrogel. An hour after inserting the gastric balloons into the stomach of three pigs and checking they had inflated, the team passed an endoscope bearing an LED into each pig and shone light onto the hydrogel pin for 30 minutes.The team found similar results could be produced by inserting an ingestible LED capsule into another three pigs. This was switched on for at least 70 minutes.Both the LED endoscope and LED capsule contained a small magnet to guide it to a metallic piece near the pin of the gastric balloon. Traverso said the magnets could be chosen for strength so they would not stick together across bodily tissue.While the team did not show that the gastric balloon was subsequently passed by the pigs, Traverso said it was very likely it would have been, since the constituent parts were now small enough to pass from the stomach into the intestines.The team also made sections of a ring-shaped stent for the oesophagus out of the hydrogel, although this was not tested in live animals. After exposure to LEDs for 30 minutes, the stent became far squishier, with tests suggesting it would be able to pass into the stomach and out of the body. Traditionally such stents have to be removed by an endoscope.Traverso said the study was a proof of concept and further work was needed – such as developing an approach that did not involve the LED attaching to the device. However the team was hopeful that the approach could eventually aid patients in a range of ways, including for controlling the release of drugs in the body.Prof Mark Miodownik, a materials engineer at University College London who was not involved in the research, said the approach was a really good example of “animate” materials, adding that while light-degrading materials had been produced before, the new study showed a well-controlled trigger, a carefully tuned hydrogel fit for use in the body, and suggested the device and LED capsule could subsequently pass out of the body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dc51f0db6f01d802563f32192e782fb5947c0a0/24_69_5400_3239/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f91721621a312aa0c96211f6f123e1e","title":"betfred owner linked to firm that advises people struggling with high debt","story":"Campaigners raise fresh concerns about Done family business after  reveals interest in gambling addiction counsellingFred Done, one of the billionaire Tory donors who owns bookmaker Betfred, also bankrolls a company that makes money advising people struggling with high debts, it has emerged.MPs and campaigners raised fresh concerns about the Done family’s business empire, a day after the  revealed that brothers Fred and Peter Done own a company that provides services including gambling addiction counselling to the public sector.Companies House filings reveal that Fred Done also invested £150,000 in Angel Advance, a debt management company set up in 2013 and part-owned by other members of the Done family.Angel Advance derives its revenues from advising indebted people, some of whom pay the company a fee to negotiate reduced repayments with creditors on their behalf.The website offers “money saving tips”, such as switching to a cheaper supermarket, cutting down on takeaways or renting a spare room to a lodger. The tips do not include stopping gambling.Angel Advance’s website also advises customers in difficulty to contact the Samaritans if they are struggling to deal with debt.A list of issues they might be facing includes job-related stress, alcohol or drug abuse and suicidal thoughts. It does not include problem gambling, despite the fact that betting addiction has been linked with elevated rates of suicide.Labour MP Carolyn Harris voiced dismay that the Done family could profit from gambling, counselling for gambling addiction and debt management all at once.“They get paid when you gamble, they get paid when you seek help for it and they get paid when you try to clear your debts,” she said.“It’s about how they can make the most of the vulnerable and squeeze blood out of a stone. It’s characteristic of the mentality of this industry.”Problem gambling has frequently been linked to high debt, including by industry regulator the Gambling Commission, which announced a ban on betting with credit cards earlier this month.Last year, the  reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction.Debt charity Step Change said people with gambling problems who seek its advice usually have more debts than those who don’t, owing an average of £16,323 to eight creditors.Fresh revelations about the Done family’s interests come a day after the  revealed that brothers Fred and Peter, who are worth a combined £1.25bn and have given £375,000 to the Conservative party, also own Health Assured.The business provides gambling counselling to staff who work at NHS trusts and in parliament, prompting an allegation of “hypocrisy” from NHS mental health chief, Claire Murdoch.Both Harris and SNP MP Ronnie Cowan called on parliament to review its contract with the company.Cowan said: “For the UK parliament to contract them to provide support is beyond the pale.“To compound matters, for Fred Done to invest in a debt management firm after helping to drive so many people into debt beggars belief.“The Dones created the problem, then paid money to support the Tory party and then the Tory government uses taxpayers money to pay them to fix the problem they created. And we wonder why people don’t trust politicians!”“The management and directors of Health Assured and Betfred are also entirely separate and independent of each other,” they added.“What is more, Health Assured has always been open, and provided full disclosure on ownership during tender processes and new contracts won have been secured on merit.”A spokesperson for the House of Commons and the House of Lords said: “UK parliament is bound by strict procurement regulations. Our focus is to ensure high quality services and value for money for the tax payer. All contracts are reviewed regularly.”Marc Etches, chief executive of the leading betting addiction charity GambleAware, added his voice to concern about the Done family’s overlapping business interests.“It is important that anyone who is experiencing gambling harms has access to appropriate support,” he said.“However, this case understandably raises concerns about a potential conflict of interest.”Joanne Whittaker, a director of Angel Advance, said: “The business is authorised and regulated by the FCA, who are aware of the make up of its ownership, and it is run completely independent of Betfred, with an entirely distinct and separate management structure.“Any clients receiving debt advice arising from gambling-related issues would receive appropriate signposting and help in accordance with our approved protocols and procedures.”• Free help and advice about problem gambling is available online at BeGambleAware.org or by calling the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05c739394209a96154baa6d7e8a306898109713/0_266_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81848ec1770f80798e1f1a3dd6f243b7","title":"talking horses defi du seuil un de sceaux ascot clarence house chase","story":"The Clarence House Chase sees two top talents facing off again following last month’s Sandown thrillerEvery great race deserves a replay and last month’s thrilling Tingle Creek could be played out once more at Ascot, where the first and second face each other in the Clarence House Chase. Defi Du Seuil (3.35) is rightly favourite to come out on top again.This could be called an away game for him, as he was beaten at odds-on when he last ran at Ascot, whereas Un De Sceaux is a triple winner of this race. But Defi’s yard was under a cloud when he flopped here in 2017 and he has since made up into an exciting chaser. With Philip Hobbs’s runners in great form, he should get his third win of the season.1.50 Ascot Papagana should not be underestimated but it is easy enough to accept Magic Of Light as the superior talent and she can repeat last year’s success.2.05 Haydock A hood is tried on Edwardstone, who raced keenly in victory at Aintree last month. He wouldn’t get away with similar behaviour on this deeper ground and Thebannerkingrebel makes more appeal. He won here in November and should thrive in the mud, though his jumping could be tidier.2.25 Ascot A disappointing eight runners for this handicap hurdle, which may fall to the only last-time-out winner, Bold Plan. A progressive type with Evan Williams, he was impressive at Haydock in November and can defy a 10lb rise.2.40 Haydock It was a huge run by the confusingly named Acting Lass to be second in Ascot’s Silver Cup just before Christmas, giving 5lb to the winner, a course specialist. He comes from an in-form yard, so there is every hope of a similar effort here, which would probably be enough. Midnight Tune is hard to weigh up but should go well from the other end of the weights.3.00 Ascot Espoir De Guye was breathtakingly good around here four weeks ago but he has been raised a stone and the opposition is classier this time. Preference is for Happy Diva, who is having such a great winter. Having landed the BetVictor in November, she ran to a similar level when just a head behind Lady Buttons last time and still looks ahead of her mark.3.15 Haydock It’s surprising to see Pentland Hills sent here, as a free-going sort who finished weakly last time, a profile which ought to make him vulnerable in this mud. Moreover, he meets all three rivals on worse terms than if this were a handicap. It’s a tricky contest but Ballyandy may be the percentage play after his fair third in the Christmas Hurdle. He should be staying on stoutly at the finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/617b9c745a776952baab876f96c8e368c408b1d3/0_0_4984_3406/master/4984.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=330427bfd46c5b894234f2519b98c3da 1760w","title":"south africa v england third test day three live","story":"“Pat Pocock,” says Kim Thonger, “was a classic example of face not fitting. I remember his first sixfer. Elegant and interesting bowler, but the selectors were so incompetent at the time that they’d pick almost any other bowler ahead of him. He managed only 25 Tests in 17 years. These were the same selectors who routinely ignored Tom Cartwright. I’m still very cross with them fifty years later.” Great stuff. And yes, Percy Pocock was very hard done by. But wasn’t it partly the fact that Ray Illingworth became captain, and he was an off-spinner too? And then Tony Greig took up off-breaks and bagged 14 wickets in a match. At least Pocock had an Indian summer, turning up as a golden oldie in David Gower’s team that went to India in 1984-85 and won. And then he was harshly dropped again, for John Emburey, who came straight back in after a ban, bearing his superior batting and his dismal strike rate. “It’s lashing down,” says Ian Ward on Sky, and the camera pans around to show that, yes, Port Elizabeth has turned into Old Trafford.Back to the serious stuff. “Speaking as a former redhead, says Ben Heywood, “it can go one of two ways - it can all fall out (can’t think of anyone this has happened to, ahem), or the ginge tinge turns grey, white or in my case, weirdly, brown. My younger son (carrots) didn’t believe I was a ginger until I inadvisedly showed him some old pictures. Now he thinks I used to look like Ronald McDonald.”Even this weather may be on England’s side. “Might a rain-interrupted day with perhaps an early finish be of benefit to England,” wonders Geoff Wignall. “Assuming they manage to take the remaining first-innings wickets or at least most of them? I’m thinking of course of an enforced follow-on with the bowlers sufficiently fresh and well rested.” Poor old Faf: it never rains, but it pours.Anything Pope can do, Bess can do almost as well. No sooner has Pope become the youngest right-hander to make a Test century for England since 1954 (the early days of Colin Cowdrey), than Bess becomes the youngest English spinner to take a Test five-for since 1968, when Pat Pocock grabbed six for 79 against Australia at the age of 21.“From Bangkok on a boozy afternoon,” says Mike Brady. I’m not sure if that’s the most promising start to an OBO email ever, or the most worrying. “Obviously Stokes is God, and he has a Pope, but how should we worship Bess?” As the new leader of the Dominicans, following a brief stint from Dom Sibley.“Lovely scoreboard to wake up to,” says Kim Thonger. “I wonder if there’s a winning formula for future England home Tests? Prepare pitches for spin and select an attack of Bess, Leach, Rashid and Moeen, backed up by pace variation from Curran and Stokes. And possibly play all home Tests at Taunton.” Hang on, what about Wood? He’s just taken one of the all-time great none-fors.“A very good morning Tim.” You can say that again, Brian Withington. “Just catching up with this morning’s OBO, not knowing who was on duty, when my heart lifted at the sight of a Norwegian Wood lyric casually yet deftly inserted into proceedings (over 34). Could I have safely addressed this email without even checking who was responsible?” Oh I don’t know – some of my colleagues have come across this old beat combo too. “What would you give to have penned the original lyric?” That is a good question. Only last Saturday, I heard Judy Collins sing it in Liverpool, bringing an 80-year-old’s elegance to bear on John Lennon’s youthful audacity.“Root’s drop,” says the subject line of an email from George Wigley. “Great captaincy from Root: he wants Bess’s five-for to be top order, unsullied by tail enders. The foresight!”Mid-44th over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) The rain gets heavy quite quickly, like a conversation about your love life. The umpires take the players off and signal an early lunch. The morning belongs to Dom Bess, with a little help from Ollie Pope – just a couple of 22-year-olds, living the dream.“Just woken (Well, it IS Saturday) and checked in,” said Adam Goves, “in sleepy Norfolk”, a quarter of an hour ago. “Surely Bess could have parried that C\u0026ampB to Pope?! It’s totally messed up the aesthetic of an otherwise perfect scorecard, or am I being a bit greedy?”43rd over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) Denly is still on, and still collecting dots, though he does dish up one bad ball which Nortje dispatches through midwicket. Bad news, lads: rain is falling.42nd over: South Africa 109-5 (Nortje 10, de Kock 0) So the best day of Pope’s career has been followed by the best day of Bess’s. Amazing stuff. For the good of the game, we could now do with a scintillating counter-attack from de Kock.Dom Bess gets his five-for! Not his best ball, short and wide, but it turns enough to take the inside edge as van der Dussen shapes to cut. Bess has five for 41, and Joe Root no longer has to feel bad about that drop.41st over: South Africa 109-4 (Nortje 10, van der Dussen 24) One batsman’s aggression infects the other as Nortje cuts Denly for his first four and reaches double figures off his 81st ball. At this rate, he’ll be 42 not out when South Africa secure the draw on Monday night.40th over: South Africa 103-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 23) Out of nowhere, van der Dussen tucks into Bess. A lofted on-drive for four, a force into the covers for two, a slog-sweep for four more, and then, with the field in sudden retreat, an easy single. Is this a change in the weather?39th over: South Africa 93-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 12) Spin from both ends! Bess’s Laker finds his Lock in the form of Joe Denly. who took his first Test wickets in Cape Town. He makes a tidy start, going for just a single.38th over: South Africa 92-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 11) The scoreboard is suddenly rocking, but only because a big turner from Bess goes for four byes.“An English red-headed XI?” says Ian Forth. “Bell, Crawley Z, Collingwood, Bairstow J, Morgan (captain), Pope, Stokes, Bairstow D (wkpr), Batty, Sidebottom A, Sidebottom R. 12th man: Fairbrother.” Combustible but effective.37th over: South Africa 88-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 11) Nortje, after making three off 66 balls, sensationally doubles his score with a leg glance off Broad.“The Smarmy Army,” muses Peter Gingold (26th over). “Nice idea. But, sad to say, they’d have to stay in the UK on account of emissions from international flights.”36th over: South Africa 84-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 10) Bess’s arm ball kisses the edge as Nortje goes back and Root, at slip, spills a simple chance. Bess responds with no more than a rueful grimace, which is big of him given that that should have been his first Test five-for.Here’s David Winter in Paris, questioning the very process of the OBO. “Are you live reporting on the third Test from the press box in Port Elizabeth, in the newsroom at  HQ whilst surrounded by dynamic colleagues breaking news stories from around the world, or are you sat in your pants on your sofa at home?” That would be telling.35th over: South Africa 83-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 9) Broad tries a bouncer. Nortje faces the music, gets the splice on it, and would give a simple catch to short leg if Pope wasn’t so deep.34th over: South Africa 83-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 9) Nortje takes a single off Bess, who is now coming round the wicket, and van der Dussen plays the first attacking stroke since du Plessis. And it’s a very good one – a dance down the track and a clean hard hit past mid-on.“Morning Tim.” Morning, Diana Powell. “What a magnificent bird on the photograph of the ground. What is it? Does it take catches on the boundary?” That bird has flown, alas – though perhaps somebody spotted it and can answer the question. All the time I should have spent with Observer’s Book of Birds went into Wisden.33rd over: South Africa 78-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 5) This collapse began with a caught-and-bowled and Broad comes close to another one as van der Dussen is deceived by a leg-cutter. And that’s drinks, with England so dominant that it’s hard to believe.Matthew Doherty has a question. “Has this Test secretly been re-allocated to Old Trafford 1956?” It’s true that Bess is in with a chance of being both Laker and Lock here. According to our friends at Cricinfo, he’s the first England spinner to take four wickets in the first 25 overs of a Test innings since Graeme Swann at Cardiff in 2011. But that was a second innings, and it didn’t even last 25 overs.32nd over: South Africa 78-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 5) Bess keeps it tight as van der Dussen clips to midwicket for a single and Nortje blocks his way to 50 (balls).“Well,” says Richard Mansell, “if one is South African this is as depressing as it must be exhilarating for England fans. It looks like we are heading for an innings defeat.” I realise that words of comfort from an Englishman may only make things worse, but ... Long way to go, and that rain has to come along some time.31st over: South Africa 77-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 4) Broad has two short covers and no fine leg, so they might as well be in Sri Lanka already. He breaks off from bowling cutters to present Nortje with a lovely inswinger, which very nearly clips the off bail. 30th over: South Africa 77-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 4) Anrich Nortje keeps Bess out and nicks a single off the last ball. He’s now faced 39 balls, more than anyone else in this innings except Elgar.“Morning Tim,” says David Horn, “and what a fine one it’s turning out to be. Was wondering how Matt Parkinson might be feeling? Dom Bess wasn’t even in the original squad. Are we picking leg spinners for a tour just for the craic? I’m assuming he’s heading for the door marked ‘Mason Crane’ about now.” Ha, you’d be spot-on if there wasn’t a tour of Sri Lanka next. Parkinson will presumably be there unless Adil Rashid finds a miracle cure for his shoulder. 29th over: South Africa 76-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 4) By playing noticeably straight, van der Dussen deals better with Broad and picks up another two.28th over: South Africa 74-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 2) Another maiden from Bess, who has 11-4-22-4 and has surely inked his name into the tour party for Sri Lanka.27th over: South Africa 74-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 2) Mark Wood takes a break to rest on Bess’s laurels. Stuart Broad enters the fray and almost joins in the fun as Rassie van der Dussen, flummoxed by a cutter, chips into the covers, not far from Joe Denly. 26th over: South Africa 72-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 0) Bess whistles through a maiden to Nortje, with scarcely a thought for people trying to write OBOs.25th over: South Africa 72-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 0) The nightwatchman is in danger of ending up not out here. Nortje almost falls to Wood, fending close to the inevitable Pope at short leg, but then plays a wily tuck that gets him off the mark, and, more importantly, up the other end. Wood has the unlikely figures of 7-4-7-0. He has been far more threatening than Bess, but the pitch is on Bess’s side, and so are the gods.24th over: South Africa 71-4 (Nortje 0, van der Dussen 0) Faf had actually started well, dancing down the track to off-drive Bess for four, then repeating the trick next ball. But Bess stuck at it and got lucky. Poor old South Africa – they’re making England’s youngest players look like world-beaters.Another one! Another big one! Faf du Plessis tucks Bess round the corner, where the unstoppable Pope pops up to take a simpler catch at square short leg. Dom Bess has FOUR FOR 22. The world has gone completely mad. 23rd over: South Africa 63-3 (Nortje 0, du Plessis 0) Another maiden from Wood, who seems to be adding parsimony to his arsenal. If he could just stay fit, he might well be England’s Mitchell Johnson.“I know this is so yesterday,” says James Gladstone, “but what kept me awake here in Chiangmai last night was ‘what the hell is a former redhead’, and subsequently – could there ever be or have been an XI of redheads given we’ve got potentially 3 already...?” I shudder to think what you’ve started.22nd over: South Africa 63-3 (Nortje 0, du Plessis 0) Root had just moved Pope to silly point, so full credit for that and time for the doubters to be silenced. What a match Pope is having. Yesterday, aged 22, he became the youngest right-hander to make a hundred for England since Colin Cowdrey in 1954. In the past 66 years, two left-handers were even younger – can you name them? An inside edge, a pop off the pad, a e forwards from silly point – and England have the wicket they most wanted.21st over: South Africa 61-2 (Elgar 33, Nortje 0) Wood’s pace again bothers Elgar, who flaps at a short one. The ball loops up and would be caught if there were two leg slips. Can’t blame Root for that.20th over: South Africa 60-2 (Elgar 32, Nortje 0) It’s Dom Bess at the other end, so no Stuart Broad for now. He too opens with a maiden, but there are no alarms for the nightwatchman Nortje.19th over: South Africa 60-2 (Elgar 32, Nortje 0) Wood does it again, third ball, and twice hurries Elgar into crabby deflections with a crooked bat. As first overs of the day go, that’s superb. But already the commentators are chuntering about a missing catcher, at second slip. Root did well on one side, with a short leg and a leg slip, but something in him keeps on wanting to overdo the caution. Maybe it’s the years he spent watching Alastair Cook setting the field.It’s Mark Wood (hooray) and he opens with a jaffa – angled into the left-handed Elgar, and jagging past him. Not even Jerusalem can dampen the excitement.“What times we live in,” says Bill Hargreaves. “Looking forward avidly to a day’s Test coverage. Thanks, in advance, for the great commentary, Tim.” Steady on. That could be like saying thanks, in advance, for the great captaincy, Joe.Not only are England in charge, but the weather is better than forecast and the day seems to be starting on time. Something must be about to go horribly wrong, and Abhijato Sensarma is onto it. “The England Test side is easily one of the most volatile sporting outfits in the world. They oscillate from positions of comfort and advantage to ones of disarray and disadvantage, often within the same session. Yesterday was their best day in Test cricket for quite some time - the experienced players kept a cool head, while the young ones showed adequate style on their way to substance. The media is printing positive headlines for this team after a long time. If they do not follow it up with classical confusion, rusty bowling, and average fielding to surrender their advantage today, would the world even make sense anymore?” Morning everyone. England’s cricketers have just woken up to face an unfamiliar challenge: how do you follow a perfect day? Yesterday they had one fresh-faced 22-year-old making a masterly hundred, and then another grabbing two top-order wickets. England finished the day 439 ahead, with Dom Bess lording it at one end and Mark Wood delivering thunderbolts at the other. The good news for South Africa is that their task is simple enough: all they have to do is dig themselves out of a deep hole. One piece of evidence is on their side. So far in the third Test, not a single wicket has fallen before lunch. England should be able to change that curious fact with their tails up and a nightwatchman to bowl at – although, the last time he found himself doing this job, Anrich Nortje made a handy fortje. Dean Elgar has been his usual craggy self with 32 not out, and the pitch is slow, verging on dead for the seamers once the ball goes soft. So there may yet be a twist, but, for the moment, England are right on top.Joe Root even got away with impersonating the rather dopey captain he used to be – keeping Sam Curran on too long, bringing Wood on too late, and being so slow to surround the bat that you wondered if he’d misread the scoreboard and thought he had 299 to play with, not 499. As it is, South Africa need 300 to avoid the follow-on, and they’ve got one-fifth of the way there, at the cost of one-fifth of the wickets. So that element of the match is nicely poised. The weather forecast, alas, is gloomy, with every hour of the day being given a 50-to-60-per-cent chance of rain. But still, the glass is almost half full. See you at 10am Port Elizabeth time, 8am GMT, for the next episode in an absorbing series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bdd746be82e37042a4683d3048623033c26e15/0_115_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0a218a8bd10a0873f90f4a5be315efe","title":"make the most of loyalty cards and nine other spending tips for spontaneous lifestyles","story":"It’s not easy to save at the best of times – and it’s even tougher if you’re prone to some last-minute spending. None of us want to miss out on that party invite or weekend away. Now you won’t have toYou’ve heard it a million times: the secret to staying on budget is to plan ahead. But, for many of us, that’s easier said than done. We work so hard that we don’t have time to organise things far in advance, nor are we able to devote as much energy to our finances as we should. But, also, it’s simply a lot of fun to be spontaneous and make the most of opportunities that come up.For that reason, it isn’t always easy to stick rigidly to a budget. Last-minute expenses, invitations for weekends away, or celebrations with friends and family can often come up unexpectedly. But if you’re canny with it, you can be spontaneous without going overboard. So here are 10 smart ways to spend that even the busiest person can stick to.Eat out smartWhen a friend suggests lunch or an evening meal on the town that you hadn’t planned for, you don’t have to miss out. Using restaurant-booking websites, you can find restaurants near to you that have special offers such as free prosecco, two- or three-course meals, or afternoon tea at reduced rates.Get rewarded for spendingOne great way to earn back some of your spending money is to use a cashback credit card. If you choose one that doesn’t have a limit on the amount of cashback you could earn – such as the American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card – you’ll be paid back a proportion of your spending as cashback. The more you spend, the greater the reward, meaning that if you use your credit card for everyday spending as well as big-ticket items, you can reap the rewards in cashback. (See Important information panel.)Set aside extra cash each month for last-minute social commitments If you know you’re liable to go big on going out, or you regularly need to find extra cash for last-minute social occasions, add a contingency to your budget so you don’t end up short at the end of the month. If you don’t use it one month, you can carry it forward towards a bigger item later. Make sure you’ve set aside enough to cover all your regular and necessary expenses such as rent or mortgage and utility bills before you calculate your spending money.Buy an annual passSome museum and gallery exhibitions charge a comparatively high fee for a one-off ticket, but offer annual passes for the cost of two or three visits. These memberships often also include free guest or child passes, so if it is somewhere you’ll visit regularly, you can save a lot of money over the course of a year. Ask whether they have an introductory rate for new members.Use an appThere are lots of money apps you can use to alert you if your spending is higher than you’d like. Different apps provide different services, from providing smart insights on your spending and showing an overview of your finances, to alerting you to where you could reduce unnecessary expenses. Be specific with your needs when you look for the app for you, and always read customer reviews to see how others have benefitted.Make the most of retailers’ loyalty cardsMany stores and supermarkets give points on shopping that can be used as part payment in-store or exchanged for vouchers and money off. Often, the deals available are more generous than the face value of the points if you decide to convert them into meal vouchers or money off on days out.Enjoy the big screenThere are plenty of ways to go to the cinema for less. Some have deals on certain days and secret blockbuster screenings at reduced rates. Afternoon showings and Sunday mornings are often cheaper, too.Get your culture on the cheapIf the theatre is more your thing, you can turn up at the box office a few hours before a performance and ask for reduced seats. Some websites list popular shows for £25 per person or less. Many theatres set aside a number of cheaper tickets for under-25s, over-60s and students of all ages, too. Be flexible about your thrillsWhile many theme parks and attractions offer the cheapest price for advance tickets, some online bookings are valid for three months to a year from the date of purchase. So if you fancy an adrenaline rush, or a fun day out for the kids, you can pre-book and then decide later when you want to go. It’s particularly useful if you want to combine your trip with a favourable weather forecast.Last-minute getawaysWhether it’s a holiday cottage by the sea, a winter sojourn in the sun, or a weekend city break, leaving it to the last minute to book can bag you a bargain. Lots of travel sites use dynamic pricing, which means that what you pay will change in response to supply and demand. If you are flexible enough to have your suitcase packed and ready to head off within 24 hours, you can snap up some incredible deals. Hotels would rather fill a room than leave it empty, and might even throw in dinner to encourage you to stay. Being spontaneous can be wonderful.American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

This sixth-sense ability to tell us what we want to watch based on things we’ve already watched is what has given Netflix the jump on its traditional competitors. And yet the failure of Mindhunter might be a sign that the algorithm is borked.This week, news emerged that, while not officially cancelled, Mindhunter has been put on the sort of indefinite hiatus that has allowed its cast to seek work elsewhere. In all likelihood, though, it won’t be back. David Fincher is buried in other commitments, and the show never had enough of a red-hot following to spark widespread viewer outrage.What’s so bizarre about the fizzling out of Mindhunter, though, is that the show should have been absolutely massive. The algorithmic tickboxes it checked off are almost unprecedented. It was a flashy prestige drama of the kind that boosts Netflix’s critical cachet. It was guided by the hand of David Fincher, who had helped House of Cards to become Netflix’s first big breakout hit. It focused heavily on true crime, when Netflix has been almost single-handed responsible for a resurgence in the genre. And it was dripping with late-20th century nostalgia, which should have put it up there with Stranger Things.And yet something was missing. Mindhunter was perennially overlooked by the major awards – it only ever gained one Emmy nomination, and that was for outstanding guest actor – and never quite felt it was hitting all the heights that it should have been. The first season was full of intermittent highlights, like the thrill of seeing real-life serial killers being depicted in a drama, but the second was released to almost no fanfare whatsoever. Perhaps this is because it lost sight of its source material. Perhaps because there wasn’t enough of a gripping throughline threading all the interviews together. Perhaps because, in all honestly, barely anything happened. Mindhunter 2 had all the signs of a series lost in an identity crisis, and perhaps that’s what brought the axe down.But at the same time, Netflix never afforded it the same publicity as some of its other offerings. Stranger Things, for instance, was kept afloat by an armada of product placement tie-ins. Russian Doll was treated like a masterpiece before anyone had even seen a frame of it. Even the final dog turd season of House of Cards was granted a smorgasbord of announcements and teaser trailers. But Mindhunter felt like it was just slung out on to Netflix as an afterthought. The most publicity the show ever got, damningly, was when a comedian sang a new theme for it on Twitter.Cancelling a series after two seasons is something that Netflix does with ease. Given the reasons why – it claims that a new season of an old show is less likely to draw new subscribers than a new series of a new show – the decision to fridge Mindhunter seems like a sensible one. It’s hard to imagine that an army of potential subscribers are holding off until they’re given a third clutch of cerebral, esoteric, low-key, semi-fictionalised accounts of serial killers from the 1970s and 1980s. So from a business perspective, the sad news is that this makes sense.But still, I’ll miss Mindhunter not least the early promise of season one. When it fired on every cylinder, there were true moments of electricity to be found. Cameron Britton’s portrayal of Ed Kemper, in particular, was a standout. A monstrous man who presented himself with all the mundanity of a primary school deputy head, there was something eternally chilling about his presence. And the effect he had on Jonathan Groff’s lead investigator was fascinating. That’s what Mindhunter should have focused on, the corroding effects of evil on a fundamentally good man.That doesn’t matter any more, though. Mindhunter is dead and largely unmourned. It was fine while it lasted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9887e779f7349c7b282b3e3a6e0808ba39149d3/6_144_2831_1699/master/2831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61141cc997b0b102e269c8586610c6fe","title":"japanese paternity leave shinjiro koizumi","story":"Shinjiro Koizumi’s move raises hopes that more new fathers will be emboldened to stay home with their babiesShinjiro Koizumi’s break from his job as Japan’s environment minister began on Friday when his wife, the TV personality Christel Takigawa, gave birth to the couple’s first child.While the daytime TV shows cooed over the new addition to the celebrity couple’s family, his decision to become the first cabinet minister to take time away from work to be with his wife and son has raised hopes of change in a country where a tiny fraction of men exercise their right to paternity leave.Japan’s leave provision is among the most generous in the world, with new fathers permitted to spend up to a year off work, albeit on reduced incomes. But very few exercise their right, citing the pressure of their job, money concerns and a work culture that expects them to put work above family commitments.Koizumi said: “Honestly, I had to think over and over how I should take time off for child-rearing, or take paternity leave, while fulfilling my public duty as environment minister. Unless we change the atmosphere, government employees presumably won’t start taking paternity leave. I hope there will be a day when lawmakers’ paternity leave is no longer news.”Critics said Koizumi, who has been touted as a future prime minister, was seeking publicity and should focus on his ministerial duties. Polls by TV networks, however, showed a majority of people backed his decision.The popular politician confirmed this week that he would stay at home, but only for a total of two weeks, spread out over three months. In addition, he will “telecommute” and work his days off around parliamentary sessions and cabinet meetings.Despite taking only a fraction of the leave he is entitled to, Koizumi’s move has raised hopes that more new fathers will be emboldened to stay home during their children’s formative days.Yuko Kawanishi, a sociologist at JF Oberlin University in Tokyo, said: “Taking just two weeks off is a bit of a joke, but it’s an important gesture by someone with Koizumi’s status and popularity. It sends a positive message to the rest of Japanese society.”Kawanishi expects firms to take a more flexible approach as older men in management positions are replaced by younger colleagues. “Some companies are going in the right direction because they realise how important having a good attitude to the work-life balance is to their corporate image,” she said. Pressure on Japanese men to continue performing their traditional role as breadwinner after becoming fathers threatens to frustrate government attempts to encourage more women to enter the workforce and to raise the country’s low birthrate.Campaigners applauded Koizumi’s rare challenge to Japan’s conservative attitude towards gender roles, particularly in its male-dominated corporate culture.“A leader’s decision can change the entire social atmosphere and serve as a trigger for more men to take childcare leave,” Tetsuya Ando, head of the nonprofit group Fathering Japan, told Kyodo news agency, adding that he would have preferred the minister to take more time off.The message appears to be getting through, with the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, among those voicing support for Koizumi.As Japan grapples with an ageing population and dwindling birthrate, the government is trying to normalise the idea of paternity leave, announcing last month that it would allow civil servants to take more than a month off.The alleged mistreatment of men who take leave gave rise to the phrase patahara, short for paternity harassment, which men who take time away from work say they experience when they return. This plight was highlighted last year when an employee of the Japanese sports equipment maker Asics sued his employer, claiming he had been unfairly treated after taking paternity leave.Kawanishi said: “If you’re going to be away for several months then a lot of Japanese people worry that they will cause trouble to their colleagues. That attitude – of not wanting to be a nuisance – is deeply embedded in the Japanese psyche, especially in the workplace.”Glen Wood took legal action in 2018 against his former employer, the financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, for allegedly forcing him out of his job after he took paternity leave. The Canadian former brokerage manager had taken five months off to be with his son, who was in intensive care, but was allegedly harassed when he returned to work. The company has denied the allegations.Koji Shidane, a company employee in his late 40s, said he could not have contemplated taking paternity leave when his two daughters were born two decades ago. “It’s a good idea,” he said of Koizumi’s decision. “It’s becoming the norm in other countries so it’s about time Japan caught up. Bringing up children is a man’s job too.”Shidane said, however, that few ordinary “salarymen” felt able to follow Koizumi’s lead. “Japan hasn’t got the balance right yet. Too many people still think that the husband must go out to work and leave childcare to his wife,” he said. “It all depends on what kind of company you work for. A lot of men are worried about what their colleagues will think of them if they take time off. But unless someone like Koizumi shows the way, nothing will ever change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122b73b58101003d02122bf6ec9199f641aba134/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2747618ac126fb328806319d34f7ba24","title":"coronavirus what airport measures are in place to detect for sick passengers","story":"Three US airports introduce screening, following action already taken in several Asian countries International airports are stepping up screening for passengers exhibiting symptoms possibly connected with the previously unknown coronavirus that has infected nearly 50 people in China and caused two deaths there.Three major US airports – San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and John F Kennedy International Airport in New York (JFK) – have announced they will screen travellers arriving from Wuhan. Passengers will be examined for symptoms of the pneumonia-like virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, with an additional 100 health workers deployed at the airports.“Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,” said Martin Cetron, the head of the CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.“On arrival to the United States, travellers from Wuhan may undergo health screening, including having their temperature taken and filling out a symptom questionnaire,” CDC said on its website. Travellers with additional symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing will have an additional health assessment.Wuhan Tianhe international airport said that a temperature checkpoint would be installed at the entrance of its main terminal and all passengers would be checked. Those found to have fevers would be placed under quarantine.Authorities in Hong Kong have also stepped up detection measures, including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.Thailand has been monitoring incoming passengers at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan, including Bangkok, Phuket, Don Mueang and Chiang Mai, since 3 January. Two people have died in Thailand from the virus. One was detected at Bangkok airport by thermal surveillance equipment.Airports in Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea are also screening passengers from Wuhan, authorities said.Indonesian authorities said they have stepped up screening at all points of entry in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Philippines is scanning all passengers at seaports and airports and those with fever will be interviewed for any history of illness and whether they have traveled to Wuhan, the country’s health secretary, Francisco Duque, said.In Australia, the New South Wales and Victorian governments both issued alerts to health professionals about the virus, urging doctors to “consider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset”.The country’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said there was “no current need for any travel advice in Australia”.“It is important to note that the new coronavirus was acquired in one seafood market in Wuhan, China, which has been closed, with no new cases reported in the last week,” Murphy said. “There is no clear evidence of human to human transmission at this time.”Murphy added that Australia was following WHO recommendations and had mechanisms in place to screen and respond to unwell travellers at airports and other points of entry to the country.The UK foreign office’s website travel advice on China does not mention coronavirus.Travel is unusually heavy right now as people take trips to and from China to celebrate the Lunar New Year.The CDC said the airport screenings are part of an effort to better detect and prevent the virus from the same family of bugs that caused an international outbreaks of Sars and Mers that began in 2002 and 2012.The WHO says entry screening “offers little benefit, while requiring considerable resources”. It suggests anyone with a respiratory illness should “seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care provider”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7e2d204aaf7a54f2f7a6593a5e7a37d88413d9/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a871d722a5ef9648ad2eb1e15c4e9953","title":"rent rise forces revered lgbt bookshop les mots a la bouche out of gay district","story":"Les Mots à La Bouche’s move from the Marais shows loss of cultural heritage, activists say In the window of France’s best-known gay bookshop, above the display of Lucian Freud art books, opera singer Maria Callas’s memoirs and a history of the Pride movement, a poster warns in giant red letters: “Cultural heritage in danger.” An urgent note on the door adds: “We need your help!”Les Mots à La Bouche, a 40-year-old Paris institution, is the top LGBT bookshop in France and considered one of the best in the world – a focal point of Paris’s historic gay neighbourhood in the Marais district. But as property speculation in central Paris reaches dizzying heights – it is estimated that at certain times of year there are more Airbnb rentals than residents in the Marais – the bookshop is being forced out by rising rents.Its departure is a blow to Paris’s gay community as activists warn that central Paris is destroying its cultural identity by allowing luxury fashion shops aimed at rich tourists to force out local businesses, including gay bars.As the local cabaret star, Yvette Leglaire, said: “The gay Marais is dying.” The Paris tourist board still promotes the Marais as “an authentic yet trendy little village” but its gay scene, which began in the 1980s when the area was still working class, shabby and cheap, is slowly being eroded. Several historic gay bars have closed in recent years as fashion labels from Lacoste to Chanel move in.The Marais’ Jewish area, situated around Rue des Rosiers, is not immune, with commercial rents doubling between 2012 and 2018. There are fears that, as with Barcelona or Venice, property speculation and commercial pursuit of profit from tourism will strip central Paris of its originality and local appeal. One long-term resident says the onslaught of luxury fashion brands is turning the Marais into “a giant, open-air duty free shop”.Sébastien Grisez, manager at Les Mots à La Bouche, says: “Paris city hall promotes the gay history of the Marais and it has painted the crossroads here in rainbow colours, but no longer having our bookshop here seems absurd.”The shop, which has been in the Marais since 1983, is open seven days a week until 11pm and stocks more than 16,000 titles. But like many historic gay bars that closed under pressure from rising rents, the shop has been given until March to find a new location elsewhere in Paris . There are rumours that a Doc Marten shoe shop will take its place.Grisez says: “Ten years ago, there were far more gay bars here, now only a few are left. It’s true that gay sociology is changing – people are more spread out, there is perhaps less need to meet in bars when you can meet on apps. But even so, people regret that this neighbourhood meeting point is disappearing.”Alain Lesturgez, who works for the forestry federation, has been coming to the bookshop for 20 years. He says: “This move would be the end of an era. It’s a place where a bookseller would take time to advise you. Once, the Marais had a lot of life, but now the luxury shops make it look the same as many other places in the world.”At the Open Bar, a historic gay venue set up by rights activist Sébastien Fossa, the manager, says: “The neighbourhood is increasingly losing its soul. It started out as a working-class neighbourhood. Gradually, the arrival of luxury brands has broken the dynamic here.”Fayçal Khiatine, who runs nearby gay bar Cox, says: “When a bookshop leaves, it’s daily neighbourhood life that will lose out.”Christian Ducou, who was born and raised in the working-class Marais of the 1950s and 60s, looks out of his kitchen window at a shiny new two-storey Calvin Klein store. He has lived there since kids played in the street and many flats had shared bathrooms on the landing and no toilets. “The first rich person I saw was the photographer Helmut Newton when he moved here,” he says.His wife, Liliane, says: “Strangely, these luxury shops are often empty. It’s as if they only set up here to have a Marais address. This neighbourhood just doesn’t seem to work as a place for luxury fashion shops. There are tiny narrow streets with no place for a limousine to park, yet they’re putting in the same extremely expensive shops you’d expect to see on a boulevard with chauffeur-driven cars waiting outside.”As the spring mayoral elections approach, politicians are fretting about how to save central Paris’s soul from property speculation and intense tourism – or whether it’s already too late. David Belliard, a Green candidate, says the fact that Les Mots à La Bouche is being forced out of the Marais shows the French capital is being deformed and “now only aimed at tourists”. The local socialist mayor of the 4th arrondissement has promised to help the bookshop find a new location but, with a March deadline looming, one has yet to be found.Sébastien Raymond, an actor, says: “This bookshop always felt like a cocoon. You knew you’d be accepted here. You felt safe.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4143316.1579301964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar martin contest to dominate election ff and fg say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar meets baby William Pardy during his canvass in Birr, Co Offaly, on Friday. Photograph: Áine McMahonPA WireAfter the frenzied speculation about when Taoiseach Leo Varadkar would call the election and the adrenaline rush within the political bubble when he actually named the date, campaign 2020 has calmed in recent days.Candidates are getting a feel for the attitudes of the electorate, but are conscious that is all it is: a preliminary assessment of opinions that may take shape later in the campaign. Many outgoing Fine Gael TDs began in trepidation of what they could be facing on the doorsteps, given the pressures in health and housing. Yet a common view among Fine Gaelers is that they expected the initial reaction to be worse than it has proven to be.“I thought we were in a bit of trouble, but not the trouble we were in the last time,” said one Cabinet member of his initial experiences in comparison to the 2016 campaign. “I was expecting a fair bit of negativity and that things would settle again. But I didn’t get it. “We are in a better position now – this game is there to play for.“We are not hated,” the Minister said, but then added of the electorate: “They don’t know what they are going to do with us.”Fianna Fáilers too report their canvass is easier than it was in February 2016 and insist there is an appetite for change.“It is housing and health,” said one outgoing TD. “‘It’s about time ye got in, I hope ye do it.’ You’d hear that a good bit.”Both parties say the election is on course to be dominated by the contest between Varadkar and Micheál Martin. Where Fianna Fáilers say Varadkar is unpopular, Fine Gael sources said the reaction to the Taoiseach is more mixed, and not as clear cut.“There are people who like him, and there are people who don’t,” said a senior party figure. It will be a presidential-style election, but Fine Gael has elevated Simon Coveney, the party’s deputy leader, to almost equal billing with the Taoiseach. Images of both appear on party branding but sources said this is more to do with Coveney’s improved standing among voters than a dip in the Taoiseach’s popularity.The party’s slogan - ‘A future to look forward to’ - was signed off on in the “last few days” before Varadkar’s announcement of the election, according to sources. A number of options were considered but party sources would not be drawn on whether any of the alternative slogans referenced the Taoiseach personallyFine Gael says the fact it has no large coalition partner it can rely upon to support the Government’s record leaves it with little option but to robustly defend itself. The opening days of the campaign went as expected, this figure added. “It is setting the scene, it is erging.”Further ergence between the former confidence-and-supply partners will come when detailed policy positions are outlined next week. Fianna Fáil, the senior figure added, will be “the change” voters want. Note of caution A senior party TD said the attitude to Fianna Fáil “genuinely is warm, it is warmer than the last time”, while adding a note of caution. “Fine Gael still has support out there among their own, it is going to be a lot closer than people think.“People vote with their pockets. “There has been a recovery outside the M50 – we will still say there hasn’t – but there has. The thing about Micheál versus Leo will become more acute in the last 10 days.”In a contest as tight as Election 2020, their head-to-head debate four days out from polling is shaping up to be the crucial campaign moment, or as one member of the Cabinet put it: “The one that will determine the election.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142810.1579258393!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fundraising drive under way to make big ben bong for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Ben: campaigners want its bell to chime for the first time since restoration work began in 2017 to mark Britain’s departure from the EU on January 31st. Photograph: Will OliverEPAAn online fundraising campaign seeking to have Big Ben ring to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on January 31st has raised more than £150,000 (€175,000).Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £152,470 of its £500,000 target from almost 10,000 donors on the GofFundMe website by Friday morning.Those who wish to celebrate Britain leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and Mark Francois MP added.“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”Mr Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell, which has been silent since 2017, back into operation.In a video posted on the fundraising site, Mr Francois said he was “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.He added that the campaign hoped to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom, what the prime minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.Mr Francois said it was “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.He finished his appeal by saying “please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again”.They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.British prime minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Mr Francois, while business secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow” but these were all thought likely to be fake names.Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on January 31st. “It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Lisa Nandy is Labour’s only hope.

Stop touching my hair! Why are you frying a banana? These are just some of the phrases we’re not allowed to utter at Sheffield University anymore. They’re “micro-aggressions” (subtly racist remarks), apparently. This Russell Group university is paying 20 students £9.34 an hour to be “race equality champions” and police their peers’ thoughts. They will teach classes that explain how to lead healthy conversations so we are not at risk of saying something that might offend. I began my politics degree at Sheffield hoping to find reasoned debate, and the embrace of opposing views. Instead, I entered an atmosphere rife with woke, intolerant, censorious anti-intellectualism.Vice-chancellor Koen Lamberts and the students’ union leaders behind these “micro-aggressions” classes are too immersed in virtue-signalling to realise their absurdity. I’m not a racist, but because I’m white, on campus I’m told I must need education to counteract my allegedly innate racist tendencies. But of course, by this flawed logic I’m unable ever to encounter racism because only discrimination against BME people is deemed legitimate.Offence is in the eye of the beholder, but Sheffield University sees it as a rule. It is as yet unclear how “micro-aggressors” will be identified or whether such allegations will warrant a disciplinary investigation, or indeed, which department will house the gulag. It’s a clever tactic by the commissars, sorry, university officials, to whip up a false sense of victimhood, then bring in Soviet-esque policies under the cloak of a knowledge hierarchy. The extent to which these students’ unions are really “anti-racist”, as they claim, was revealed when they wailed and protested over the EHRC report including a finding that nine per cent of White British students have experienced racism. That doesn’t fit the script.It is the latest in the march towards a toxic “cancel culture” at Sheffield University. When I unloaded my bags in freshers week three years ago, I sported a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt. Now, that thought repels me. The campus zealots have put me off the Left for life. Shortly after writing in the  about my lecturers blocking students from crossing picket lines to attend classes in March 2018, I was hauled before senior staff members in my department and shouted at, told I had shamed the department. They later apologised, but it was a foretaste of things to come.My university announced compulsory climate change lectures for all students in September, the same month that bosses brought in gender-neutral toilets on SU club nights, without telling anyone the single-sex toilets had vanished. The students’ union organised meetings to shift from being “simply non-racist to actively anti-racist” in October - and banned white students from attending. I dared to challenge this screeching paradox and the mob pounced on me online. I expect pronoun lectures to pop up on my timetable next week.It’s a culture of compliance on campus where your voice is only permitted if you’re a self-identified minority, or politically correct. Most students can see the madness of the race equality champions and how pathetic this notion of needing a “safe space” really is, but are too afraid to speak out. A teaching assistant confided in me recently that he was being bullied by Marxist lecturers who had complained to senior staff that his views were offensive to them, and had rejected his “Tory” PhD thesis. He said he’s scared here on campus, but would never say so publicly. Our universities may still be revered the world over, but they’ve fallen into the clutches of mob rule. There is a glimmer of hope. Myself and other silenced students nationwide are setting up free speech societies on campus to re-platform the no-platformed the accused “transphobes” and “racists”.I accept my university has cancelled me. But the prospect of the last vestiges of academic freedom crumbling in our seats of learning scares me more than Sheffield’s thought police will ever stifle us.University of SheffieldThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Most people have known about child labour in factories for decades. After learning about it, as a small form of personal protest I have refused to own anything Nike since I was a teenager. The factory fire in Bangladesh again brought the horrifying conditions of garment workers to light, however the conditions in factories- as well as our consumer habits - to a large extent, remain unchanged.In terms of the environmental impact of fashion and production, the argument is clear cut: produce less waste less. However, aside from the conditions and pay of workers, I find the ethics a bit more complicated. Businesses provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so what impact would a decline have on these communities? I will also try to explore these sorts of contradictions (if that is what they are).I know it will not be easy as I can already anticipate challenges such as buying (and receiving) gifts, socks and underwear, home renovation, cosmetics and many others, but I will try my best.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“This highlights the critical importance of the government addressing the challenge around housing supply, particularly with the gradual phasing out of the Help to Buy incentive,” he added.The RICS survey, based on the opinions of surveyors up and down the country, found that 17 per cent more respondents saw a rise rather than a fall in enquiries from new buyers last month, up from minus 5 per cent in the previous month.Most regions saw interest from new buyers increase, with respondents in Wales and the north east reporting solid growth while enquiries rose in London and the south east after negative results in November.The housing get-rich-quick scheme is dead. And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target. The economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

(Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)The changes come after Disney’s $73.1bn purchase of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets.

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent.

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Future iPhone could have no ports at all, report suggestsInstead, they tasked the European Commission with pushing companies to adopt a common charger that would fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices.In practise, most companies have moved towards the relatively new USB-C standard, which is now used by many Android phones. That solves the issues that were present in previous attempts at a common standard, and has been adopted across the industry.Even Apple now uses USB-C in its iPads and MacBooks. But it has kept the Lightning charger in its phones and related products like the AirPods Pro, ever since it was first released in 2012.Some rumours have suggested that Apple could give up the charging port entirely, instead offering wireless charging.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Children are mistreated and prejudice abounds in this disturbing modern fairy tale set around the enigmatic character of Bride, who makes a mistake that has devastating consequences. (MC)Solar, which was partly based on Ian McEwan’s own experiences during a trip to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen, is a darkly comic novel. Against the backdrop of the battle against climate change, McEwan tells the story of middle-aged Nobel laureate Michael Beard, a self-serving physicist whose own world is in danger of meltdown. (MC)340 Manning Marable – Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention (2011)Columbia University professor Manning Marable died on 1 April 2011, just days before the publication of his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention. Marable drew from letters, diaries and FBI files for a meticulous, incisive and balanced account of the life of the civil rights’ leader. The book cuts through the myths to reveal Malcolm X in all his conflicted complexity. (MC)440 . Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey – She Said (2019)They wrote the story that changed the world and now they’ve explained how they did it. In She Said, the Pulitzer Prize-winning duo explain how they managed to barge through Hollywood’s ironclad gates and break the Weinstein story, publishing allegations from several women accusing the disgraced producer of sexual assault in The New York Times. While the details are sparse in terms of sources and specific tactics, there are some startling revelations, including how Gwyneth Paltrow became a helping hand and the extreme lengths Weinstein’s team went to in order to thwart both reporters and silence the alleged victims. (OP)Future Sex is perhaps one of the few nonfiction books about sex and relationships that came before #MeToo and somehow remains relevant today. Finding herself suddenly single at the age of 30, Witt immerses herself in the sexual subcultures of San Francisco, trying her hand at everything from polyamory to orgasmic meditation. It’s a fascinating piece of work, one that illustrates Witt’s talents as an essayist and gives plenty of room to many astute observations on sexual liberation. (OP)Every now and then a book comes along that tilts your perspective on the world. This internationally best-selling phenomenon is one of them. Covering just about the entire sweep of human history, it makes you understand the fits, starts and savagery of progress. (CR)The Girls is about exploring the appeal of being in a cult. Inspired by Charles Manson’s murderous “family”, the book serves up a more tense, richer depiction than Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, one that puts women at the centre, examining what motivates and captivates them. (OP)840 Marlon James: A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014)The Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Jamaican-born Marlon James, follows the lives and deaths of seven of the would-be killers in the failed 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley. The novel cleverly weaves fiction and fact – and the language has a musical rhythm. Some of the epiphanies in the book are linked to songs. (MC)Terminal illness and bankruptcy shouldn’t make for an inspiring read but they somehow do in Raynor Winn’s poetic, provocative memoir. After losing the family home, Win and her husband set out to walk the South West Coast path, shaking a fist at his grim diagnosis. It’s as much a meditation on the power of nature as 1040 Nina Stibbe – Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life (2013)There’s deadpan and then there’s Nina Stibbe, who proves herself the heir to Adrian Mole in this novel written in the form of letters to her sister from a child-minding job in London. A provincial girl grappling with the strange salads of the metropolitan literary elite, Stibbe is comic gold. (CR) The assassins Eli and Charlie Sisters were played by John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the film version of Canadian-born writer Patrick deWitt’s second novel. The narrator Eli captures the lawless, unpredictable nature of frontier life in the mid-19th century. The Sisters Brothers is a compelling, unsettling tale of the Gold Rush era. (MC)Every office has its misfit, and this is the funny, deeply touching story of a woman whose aversion to social niceties and the work Christmas lunch hides a traumatic past. Common acts of kindness rekindle the protagonist in this beautifully told debut. (CR)Anna Burns became the first writer from Northern Ireland to win the Man Booker Prize, when she triumphed with The Milkman in 2018. Burns’s challenging, intriguing novel presents an unnamed 18-year-old girl’s perspective of her life during the Troubles in the Seventies. The 41-year-old paramilitary leader known as “the Thanks to Margaret Atwood and the state of the world, feminist dystopian fiction is having a moment and Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure is a notable contribution to the genre. It is perhaps one of the most creative of additions, cleverly weaving mystery and murder with sex and sisterhood, all while Mackintosh seduces the reader into her Shakespearean realm. (OP)1540 Anne Tyler – A Spool of Blue Thread (2015)Anne Tyler is a master of stories about family life in middle-class America. A Spool of Blue Thread, the 20th novel from the author of The Accidental Tourist, adroitly shines a light on sibling rivalry, family secrets and the wounding power of grief. Her tale of four generations of the Whitshanks demonstrates again her gift for comic detail. (MC)The Green Road, by Dublin-born Anne Enright, is set in County Clare, a wild place geographically and emotionally. Enright’s keen gift for observation is at play in this family saga based around Hanna, Dan, Constance and Emmet’s Christmas return to the home that their scary matriarch, Rosaleen, is selling. A funny, painful tale of selfishness and compassion. (MC)1740 Amor Towles – A Gentleman in Moscow (2016)The gentleman in question is Count Rostov, a bon vivant and aristocrat placed under house arrest in a fancy Moscow hotel after the communists seize control. His wit and enduring humanity make this charming, quirky novel sing. (CR)When fact meets fiction, the result is almost always fascinating as the reader spends hours trying to discern which is which. Such is the appeal of The Idiot, Elif Batuman’s debut novel, which tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young woman studying at Harvard in the mid-Nineties. After pontificating on the purpose of email, she soon becomes obsessed with an enigmatic Hungarian student whose insouciance will leave you spinning in a state of total frustration. (OP)Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk’s 10th novel was the short, stunning The Red-Haired Woman, which is at once a fable and a gripping tale of youthful obsession, exploring protagonist Cem Celik’s desire for the red-haired, enigmatic member of a theatre troupe. The father-son relationship in the novel also allows Pamuk to deftly explore the changing nature of Turkey. (MC)A dazzling insight into the mind of one of The New Yorker’s most prolific writers, Ariel Levy’s memoir will seem relatable to all those who have at one time or another felt a startling sense of dissociation from their life, which is probably most of us. Levy’s personal tragedies will leave readers reeling. There is one passage in particular that will stay with you for months in which Levy describes how she suffered a miscarriage on a hotel room floor while on an assignment in Mongolia. She was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and her son, born alive, died in her arms. It is a story of resilience to the highest degree.

He is forced to face up to “the accumulation, the multiplication, of loss”. (MC)No matter how many documentaries you watch or books you read on Mormonism, it’s almost impossible to understand such a community from the outside. Tara Westover opened people’s eyes with Educated, explaining how she went from growing up in a Mormon fundamentalist family in Idaho to studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge. It’s an inspiring story of grit and determination that doubles up as an homage to the power of self-education and, well, reading. (OP)Few things reinforce tired gender clichés like marriage and parenthood, so huzzah for Maggie Nelson with this subversive memoir. It subjects romantic love, pregnancy, motherhood and all the attendant tedious cultural baggage to an intensely intelligent, glittering critique. (CR)In Canada, retired English teacher Dell Parsons, the son of hapless bank robbers, looks back on the heart-breaking events of his teenage years and tries to “take account” of how his life was shaped.

(CR)Walter and Patty Berglund, the seemingly perfect couple who meet at college in the 1970s, are at the heart of Jonathan Franzen’s fourth novel.

(MC)A sprawling, multi-generational tale of a Turkish family who make a new life in London, this novel has a so-called ‘honour killing’ as its centre of gravity. Shafak, a best-selling author in Turkey and many other countries, conjures up the hypocrisy that holds women to different standards, with devastating results. (CR) 3140 Helen Macdonald – H Is for Hawk (2016)When Helen Macdonald lost her father, she acquired a hawk.

(CR)3340 Jennifer Egan – A Visit from the Goon Squad (2010)Time is a central theme of Jennifer Egan’s vibrant A Visit from the Goon Squad, which interconnects stories involving Sasha, a kleptomaniac New Yorker in her mid-thirties, and her music business boss Bennie Salazar.

(MC)3440 Matt Haig – Reasons to Stay Alive (2015)There’s a reason why Matt Haig’s writing on mental health has earned him such high praise, with the Duchess of Sussex among his fans. And it all started with this bestselling memoir in which the children’s fiction author describes falling into a deep depression in his early twenties that left him contemplating taking his own life. It’s not an easy read, but in a society where suicide remains grossly misunderstood and gender stereotypes hinder men from speaking openly about their mental wellbeing, it’s a crucial one.

While Rooney has gone on to publish a second novel, Normal People, which was shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, Conversations with Friends remains her best work. With its snappy short sentences, sophisticated plot and characters so complex that it’s hard to like any of them, the novel established Rooney as one of the most exciting new writers around. (OP)3740 George Saunders – Lincoln in the Bardo (2017)Lincoln in the Bardo tells the story of a single night in the life of Abraham Lincoln – when his 11-year-old son was buried – through an experimental tale involving 166 narrators in the bardo, the transitional state between one’s death and rebirth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. George Saunders’ enchanting tour-de-force won the 2017 Man Booker Prize. (MC)In 2019, female desire warrants shrewd examination more than ever. Thank goodness, then, for Lisa Taddeo, who spent eight years documenting the sexual experiences of three very relatable but very different women.

(OP)An outrageous satire of contemporary race relations, Beatty’s The Sellout tells the story of a black man called Bonbon who is seeking to reinstitute slavery and segregation.

Hilary Mantel –  Bring Up the Bodies (2012)The sequel to Mantel’s Booker-winning Tudor tour de force, Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies did not Let Down the Readers. Her immersive prose takes us back into the poetic, rigorous mind of the archetypal career politician, Thomas Cromwell. The subject is the stuff of school days – Henry Tudor’s marriage to Anne Boleyn, and her fatal failure to produce a male heir. To allow another marriage and safeguard the stability of the country, Cromwell engineers Boleyn’s downfall, constructing capital charges against the queen along with a few of his old enemies to boot.

(CR)140 Toni Morrison – God Help the Child (2015)Toni Morrison died in August her final novel, 2015’s God Help the Child, displays her award-winning powers of elegant prose and imagination.

The book cuts through the myths to reveal Malcolm X in all his conflicted complexity. (MC)440 . Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey – She Said (2019)They wrote the story that changed the world and now they’ve explained how they did it. In She Said, the Pulitzer Prize-winning duo explain how they managed to barge through Hollywood’s ironclad gates and break the Weinstein story, publishing allegations from several women accusing the disgraced producer of sexual assault in The New York Times. While the details are sparse in terms of sources and specific tactics, there are some startling revelations, including how Gwyneth Paltrow became a helping hand and the extreme lengths Weinstein’s team went to in order to thwart both reporters and silence the alleged victims. (OP)Future Sex is perhaps one of the few nonfiction books about sex and relationships that came before #MeToo and somehow remains relevant today. Finding herself suddenly single at the age of 30, Witt immerses herself in the sexual subcultures of San Francisco, trying her hand at everything from polyamory to orgasmic meditation. It’s a fascinating piece of work, one that illustrates Witt’s talents as an essayist and gives plenty of room to many astute observations on sexual liberation. (OP)Every now and then a book comes along that tilts your perspective on the world. This internationally best-selling phenomenon is one of them. Covering just about the entire sweep of human history, it makes you understand the fits, starts and savagery of progress. (CR)The Girls is about exploring the appeal of being in a cult.

(OP)840 Marlon James: A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014)The Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Jamaican-born Marlon James, follows the lives and deaths of seven of the would-be killers in the failed 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley.

(MC)Terminal illness and bankruptcy shouldn’t make for an inspiring read but they somehow do in Raynor Winn’s poetic, provocative memoir. After losing the family home, Win and her husband set out to walk the South West Coast path, shaking a fist at his grim diagnosis. It’s as much a meditation on the power of nature as 1040 Nina Stibbe – Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life (2013)There’s deadpan and then there’s Nina Stibbe, who proves herself the heir to Adrian Mole in this novel written in the form of letters to her sister from a child-minding job in London. A provincial girl grappling with the strange salads of the metropolitan literary elite, Stibbe is comic gold. (CR) The assassins Eli and Charlie Sisters were played by John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the film version of Canadian-born writer Patrick deWitt’s second novel.

The 41-year-old paramilitary leader known as “the Thanks to Margaret Atwood and the state of the world, feminist dystopian fiction is having a moment and Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure is a notable contribution to the genre.

(OP)1540 Anne Tyler – A Spool of Blue Thread (2015)Anne Tyler is a master of stories about family life in middle-class America. A Spool of Blue Thread, the 20th novel from the author of The Accidental Tourist, adroitly shines a light on sibling rivalry, family secrets and the wounding power of grief. Her tale of four generations of the Whitshanks demonstrates again her gift for comic detail. (MC)The Green Road, by Dublin-born Anne Enright, is set in County Clare, a wild place geographically and emotionally. Enright’s keen gift for observation is at play in this family saga based around Hanna, Dan, Constance and Emmet’s Christmas return to the home that their scary matriarch, Rosaleen, is selling. A funny, painful tale of selfishness and compassion. (MC)1740 Amor Towles – A Gentleman in Moscow (2016)The gentleman in question is Count Rostov, a bon vivant and aristocrat placed under house arrest in a fancy Moscow hotel after the communists seize control. His wit and enduring humanity make this charming, quirky novel sing. (CR)When fact meets fiction, the result is almost always fascinating as the reader spends hours trying to discern which is which. Such is the appeal of The Idiot, Elif Batuman’s debut novel, which tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young woman studying at Harvard in the mid-Nineties. After pontificating on the purpose of email, she soon becomes obsessed with an enigmatic Hungarian student whose insouciance will leave you spinning in a state of total frustration.

It was especially surprising that the wolves retrieved the ball for a person they had never met before.”The wolf expert said the similarities between the two canine species can tell us about where the behaviour we see in dogs comes from.She said the results, although probably rare, show our ancestors may have attempted to domesticate wolves as well as dogs.She added: “Wolf puppies showing human-directed behaviour could have had a selective advantage in early stages of dog domestication.”Her team will now continue to work with the data they have collected over the course of three years hand-raising wolves and dogs under identical conditions to learn even more about their behavioural differences and similarities.The study appears in the journal iScience.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

astronauts to the moon during the Apollo program.SpaceX\u0026nbspis carrying out the procedure in conjunction with Nasa, with both organisations using the data to evaluate whether the spacecraft can be certified as safe to carry astronauts.It is expected to be an impressive spectacle, with the “rapid unscheduled disassembly” set to be livestreamed on\u0026nbspSpaceX’s\u0026nbspwebsite.“We expect there to be some sort of ignition, and probably a fireball of some kind,” Benji Reed,\u0026nbspSpaceX’s\u0026nbspdirector of crew mission management, said during a press briefing on Friday.“Whether I

We’ll have to see what actually happens. But I wouldn’t be surprised, and that wouldn’t be a bad outcome if that’s what we saw.”The exact time of the explosion will depend on a number of factors, including launch time and weather conditions, and a dedicated team of recovery personnel will be in place to gather up any debris.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A 2018 regulation means Amazon can no longer sell its own brand products in India\u0026nbspand must instead provide a marketplace for local manufacturers and producers.Jeff Bezos momentarily beaten as richest man in worldJeff Bezos and the farcical philanthropy of the super-richAmazon ‘threatens to fire’ employees for climate change campaigningAmazon driver refuses to deliver sherry to 92-year-old without IDAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Mr Bezos said the company was “excited about what lies ahead”\u0026nbspand has been gushing in his praise of India throughout the trip, at one point saying that “the 21st century is going to be an Indian century” and describing cooperation between the US and India as “the most important alliance in the 21st century”.India, it seems, is not so enamoured with him. A Reuters report said Mr Modi had rebuffed repeated requests from Amazon to meet Mr Bezos during his visit for a prime ministerial photo opportunity.On Thursday, while the CEO took part in a chummy interaction with the actor Shah Rukh Khan at a Mumbai event promoting Amazon’s Prime Video, most media focused instead on the scathing comments of India\u0027s trade minister Piyush Goyal at a security conference in Delhi.Dismissing Amazon’s announcement of $1bn investment in India, made at the start of Bezos’s trip, Mr Goyal told the audience that “it’s not as if they are doing a great favour to India”. He said Amazon had been operating at a loss of around that much over the last year, so “if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars”.On Friday, another senior politician – Vijay Chauthaiwale, the chief of the ruling BJP’s foreign affairs department – took a swipe at Mr Bezos’s Washington Post for its coverage of India, which he called “highly biased and agenda driven”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWithout giving any examples, Mr Chauthaiwale said there were “a lot of problems” with the Post’s reporting. “I am not opposing Amazon as a company, in fact I am a regular customer… Jeff Bezos should go home tell Washington Post what is his impression about India,” he said.But it is the vocal protest movement against Amazon that is likely to have hurt Mr Bezos the most, with placard-waving demonstrators attending outside the business summit he addressed.Rallies were organised in 300 cities across the country by powerful retail lobbying group\u0026nbspthe Confederation of All India Traders, which claims to speak for the up to 25 per cent of the population dependent on small businesses.The group argues that Amazon is putting people out of business with predatory pricing and other “malpractices”. Its national secretary, Sumit Agarwal, called Mr Bezos an “economic terrorist”.Created with Sketch.Jeff Bezos\u0027 plan for future space colonies Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAmazon said it was “confident in our compliance” with marketplace regulations and would “welcome the opportunity to address allegations made about Amazon”.India\u0027s shopkeepers have represented a core constituency for the BJP since the early days of the party, and the comments of Mr Goyal and Mr Chauthaiwale have been widely shared by the party’s vociferous supporters online.But industry executives warned that it was a risky manoeuvre that would likely put off international investment, at a time when the country\u0027s economic growth is already projected to fall to a 11-year low this year. One unnamed leader at an American company operating in India told Reuters that Mr Goyal’s remark in particular was “clearly unbecoming, and it will hurt how the world views India as a destination”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh. Really When it comes to tackling crime on our streets, the majority of us want someone on our side who possesses instinct, courage and common sense.Which you either have or don’t regardless of qualications.NATURISTS John and Donna Price have moved from Kent to Lincolnshire for more privacy because they like to barbecue in the nude.“I love a flambeed banana,” says Donna, .Oooer.Aren’t our AEs under enough pressure Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan have said they wish to be “independent”. A lot of time has been spent working out how that independence can be achieved.Well, here’s the thing. I have a cunning plan for the Sussexes as to how they might be “independent”.What you need to do is get something called a “job”.If you get one of those they give you money which you can use to buy things — a house, some Pot Noodles, a Hot Wheels car racing set — anything, really, within reason.  Remarkable, isn’t it It probably wouldn’t pay for the £million Canadian mansion Meghan is holed up in right now — but they can always ponce a few freebies off their mega-rich friends.It might not quite cover the legal costs Meghan may incur from her upcoming court case. She’s suing a newspaper and her dad is set to testy AGAINST her.You have to say she has a knack, this lass, of getting on the wrong side of quite a few people.I think it’s fair to guess that the Royal Family are not entirely happy with her right now. So she’s hacked off her new family much as she’s hacked off her own one.It’s no huge surprise they’re both heading off to “Canada” .Meghan seems not to like the UK very much. She doesn’t spend much time in it and my suspicion is that the local people haven’t entirely taken to her.We had a bit of time for Harry, once. He seemed an amiably thick rugger-bugger with a mischievous sense of humour. Not any more, sadly.He seems to spend half of his time crying. And he also seems to have swallowed whole the air-headed, ultra-woke, touchy-feely drivel his we has imported from the United States.Still, we were happy to spend an extortionate sum doing up their “cottage” with the most expensive materials money could buy. And we were delighted to see photographs of young Archie — once we were allowed to by madam.For someone who dislikes the starchy formality of the Royal Family, Meghan displays quite a few airs and graces, doesn’t she Hates being photographed and gets her bullying minders to stop people taking snaps. Loves being photographed when she’s promoting herself or her vacuous ideas.But hey, they love each other and that’s the important thing.Let them move to Canada or LA, where they can jabber to each other about climate change and how everyone who doesn’t like her is racist, until the cows come home.But let them do it entirely independently. No money from the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. No royal stipend. No security staff paid for by the taxpayers, either here or there.Let them be truly independent, which is what they seem to wish for.Maybe they’ll find it liberating. Or maybe in a year or two Prince Harry will wake up and think: Crikey, what have I done.DO you remember when you first had a McDonald’s  I remember very well. I was  and had just come down to London from Middlesbrough.My girlfriend told me about these wonderful things called Big Macs. I tried one – couldn’t believe how delicious it was. So I bought another, and then another.Stood there, stuffing my fat face, eyes wide with delight.As the years go by, the pleasure diminishes a little – there’s nothing better than tasting something delicious for the first time.So lucky, lucky people of Rutland. The UK’s smallest county is to have its first ever McDonald’s.A lot of poncey residents opposed this happening because they said it would “lower the tone” of the county.Now the snobs can find out what they’ve been missing all these years.RIVETED with excitement by the Labour leadership contest  It’s a real humdinger, isn’t it I had rather hoped David Lammy would stand, just to give us all a laugh. Sadly, he’s not going to.Ultra Trot Clive Lewis has pulled out. But Emily Thornberry, above – Lady Nugee to you, you lowly serf – is through to the next round.If she wins it will be the final nail in the coffin of this once-great party.SO, Manchester City’s underperforming stars hired a whole bunch of Instagram “models” to attend a party at some posh place in Cheshire.Flew them over from Italy, shoved them in a hotel, Bob’s yer uncle.The wives and girlfriends of the players were not invited to this party. Lovely bunch, footballers, aren’t they And was all of this sanctioned by the supposedly progressive and right-on manager, Pep Guardiola “That was not what I meant, Senor Aguero, when I said you had to get in the box more often.” HERE is yet another Re-moaner head case for you. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves.He has said he fears Britain will be reminiscent of Nazi Germany when we finally leave the European Union. Yup, that’s a sane and rational judgment, you bearded loon.He added: “People are crying when they go to sleep at night and when they wake up in the morning, and all they get from the unfeeling, hard-headed Tories is moans.“They are feeling a sense of loss which is akin to bereavement, and a grieving process has only just begun.“In these circumstances, triumphalistic behaviour, festivals of Brexit and all the rest will simply make things worse.”Who is crying  What bereavement process  What kind of drugs is Lord Greaves taking Let’s all go round to his gaff on January  with a few cans of Stella and try to cheer him up.A BRITISH mum is leading a fightback against the drive to make our children cretins.The unnamed woman went on Mumsnet to explain that she turns the house wi off at .pm every night.And tells her three kids – the oldest is  – to read a book instead. Good for her. Children seem to use the internet for just three things.Bitching about thots in their school. And sending snap-shots of their genitals to -year-old men who are pretending to be teenagers.THERE was a rather cheering plan to ring out the church bells across the land to mark our escape from the European Union at the end of the month.But a bunch of bishops have said we shouldn’t do that because the bells should only be used to summon the faithful to worship.With the greatest of respect, your reverend, b*****ks. You can tell it’s nothing to do with that by their comments.One said: “Two thirds of the population never voted for Brexit in the first place. It’s deeply isive to ring church bells for something like this.”Yeah, Bish – we have a habit in this country of only counting the votes of people who voted, you mimsy frock-wearing halfwit.Another said: “I think we should be ringing bells on February , not to celebrate Brexit but to call people together to pray for our nation at this critical time.”Ah, go shove your bells up your cassock, you miserable Remoaner God-bothering bores.A UKRAINIAN bloke woke up one morning to discover a large metal nut around his old fella.His we had placed it there during the night to stop him shagging other women. And presumably her.It seems to have worked. He couldn’t get the thing off. So he went to hospital where they removed it with a circular saw which spat out sparks as it tore through the metal.I don’t think his todger will be doing very much at all for the foreseeable future.He should have kept the thing on. And the first time he got excited his partner would be hit by flying shrapnel. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit.

We will not dilute our high standards of food safety and animal welfare.“In our forthcoming trade negotiations, this Government will be prepared to walk away from those negotiationsthat is in the national interest.”No added last night: “We have made this commitment a number of times. There will be no reduction in food standards after Brexit”.Meanwhile, Europe’s Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan yesterday tore in to the PM’s hopes of getting a full trade deal with the EU in place by the end of the year, dubbing it “just not possible”.Irish politician Mr Hogan insisted: “Certainly by the end of the year we are not going to get everything that’s in the -page document on the future relationship agreed, because Prime Minister Johnson decided we are going to have everything concluded by the end of the year.”Calling on Mr Johnson to change his mind and agree to extend the transition period for longer talks, he added: “I think we’ve seen that putting ourselves into timelines in the last few years have not been that helpful, especially in the way it played out in the House of Commons”.The skirmish came as German leader Angela Merkel warned Brussels that Brexit is “a wake up call” for the EU.The German Chancellor said she was worried the UK could pose a serious economic threat to the EU, and the bloc has to lt its game to stay relevant.Remainers’ scaremongering over America’s “chlorinated chicken” was a ruse to obstruct Brexit. The left piled in for another chance to attack Trump.But it is simply not a “lower standard” of food, as .million Brits who visit the US each year will attest. US chicken treated with an extremely dilute chlorine solution has a far lower rate of ­salmonella infection than EU chicken.Nor is it credible to complain that the practice disguises unacceptable cruelty in the mass production of poultry, given how blithely we accept our own.Brexit Britain must be open to deals with America and everywhere . That involves importing their produce.Of course consumers must not be exposed to inferior or unsafe grub.But let’s deal in facts, not politically driven hysteria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was an almighty crash, it sounded like Armageddon was going on outside.It went very quickly from just normal storm and wind noise to sounding like a freight train was hitting our window.There was a loud crack and the whole house felt like it was buffering.Our bedroom windows have been pushed in, the UPVC support structures are broken and we have fence and roof damage.Well have to pay to for a new fence and we have people from the insurance company coming round later about the other damage.The main thing is that nobody was injured as far as we know but it was really scary while it was going on.Just last month a family feared for their lives as a freak tornado smashed into  homes in Surrey.A spokesman for the Met Office said: We cannot say definitelya tornado formed or not.

These are typically small and short-lived, but can cause structural damagethey pass over built-up areas.The strength of the winds of up to mph shook numerous houses, sending roof tiles smashing to the ground.A ft long brick wall collapsed under the strength of the gusts while fence  were flung through the air.Part of a garden shed that had been picked up by the tornado smashed a hole through the windscreen of a car.Radar images taken at the time suggest the damage was caused by a tornado, and it has been reported to Torro - The UKs leading tornado and storm research group.Among their ranks is weather forecaster Paul Knightley, who works for DTN Weather - the organisation behind the BBCs forecasts.Mr Knightley said: There were big and heavy showers at the time in question and the damage reported does tie up.When damage is in a clear track - as appears to be the case here - it is more often than not the result of a tornado.I would say it is probable there was one here and the the type of damage reported is consistent with weak, low level tornadoes.Its impossible to say what the exact wind speeds were at the time but my guess would be between mph and mph.Annette OFlynn said: Our garden shed was totally demolished in Seaward Avenue. It felt like the whole house moved and it was very scary.Stephen Maskell said: We were woken by something which sounded like an express train thundering past the house and gravel hitting the windows.It bought down our front fence including snapping a concrete post in half, breaking ridge tiles on the roof and dislodging tiles.

The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages.

It seems like such a waste for them to walk away.This week, Harry launched his Invictus Games with suitably stirring music and a passionate voiceover that showed how much he cares about this terric project, which helps wounded servicemen and women from all over the world.It is such a positive and effective way to give these heroes real purpose. Harry has been the driving force since it was little more than an idea on the back of a fag packet.The next day she made a low-key visit to young girls campaigning to combat climate change.Meghan was relaxed, caring and didn’t look for special treatment.Her visits were without pomp and fuss. You can tell it meant the world to everyone she encountered.She could easily have stayed in her mansion on Vancouver Island, closed the curtains and spent her days being pampered.Instead, she got up off her bottom and tried to do a bit of good for causes she cares about.It is admirable — but would the world have been as interestedthey were just plain old Harry and Meghan, without the aura of royalty And will the world’s Press still give such deserving causes the same level of attention this time next yearHarry and Meghan are no longer members of the Firm I’m not so sure. That’s why I would love them to slam on the brakes and reconsider their position.They can always rehire the staff axed from Frogmore House, especially as a move to Canada as “quasi royals” doesn’t look as welcoming as they first thought.Bedazzled PM Justin Trudeau at first promised that the famed Mounties would provide security and protection, but he has had to embarrassingly roll back on his offer and, while the extremely polite Canadians are happy to have Harry and Meghan as guests, they aren’t so keen on footing the bill to have them there permanently.The Queen would be thrilled to have her grandson back and the chance to get to know her great-grandson Archie properly.She would want to buy him his first pony and watch him learn to ride. He could grow up with his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and be a proper part of the family.There are obviously tensions, hurt feelings and resentments within this clan. But surely the terribly British passive-aggressive arguments and niggles could be ironed out.It can’t really be too late to wipe the slate clean and start afresh.The first thing to be done is for Harry and Meghan to drop that daft court case against a British newspaper which printed a letter she had written to her dad, after he ­voluntarily handed it over.No one is going to come out of that fight with any dignity, and we don’t want to see Thomas Markle forced to give evidence against his daughter in court. They should concentrate their energies instead on trying to salvage their relationship, though I fear that ship has sailed.And brothers William and Harry need to go for a beer and sort out their gripes.Harry also needs to get back in touch with his old pals, who have been fiercely loyal and deeply hurt at being airbrushed out of his le.Surely an agreement can be hammered out which sees Harry and Meghan able to pursue their own causes without being stled by the Palace hierarchy, but also with everyone singing from the same song sheet and not constantly upstaging each other.I know the Queen wants Harry and Meghan’s new roles to be cut and dried as quickly as possible, with minimum fuss. But maybe what is needed is a bit of breathing space. Harry is due to go back to Canada in a couple of days to be reunited with Meghan and their young son.It might be a forlorn hope, but I would dearly like to see them having a rethink about their future and come back in from the Canadian cold.It would be a shamepride and stubbornness on both sides stopped them as I believe they would still get a warm welcome from the vast majority of us.

I’m proud to know her.She lost st after realising she was too heavy and wanted to be healthier for her son.Being overweight subjects you to all kinds of health problems. It is not about fat-shaming.You need to be sensible and take care of yourself.Adele has grafted to provide for her child and now has literally worked her ar*e off to make sure she is around for as long as possible.

My favourites for the role include Britain’s most handsome man Idris Elba, right – obviously – as well as Scotsman Richard Madden and the delectable Andrew Scott.Andrew was a villain in Bond’s previous big-screen outing, ’s Spectre, but let’s not hold that against him.If EastEnders’ Ben Mitchell can have SIX dferent heads over the years, we can surely ignore the slight inconvenience of Andrew’s scheming tech-terrorist trying to bump off all of MI.James Norton is another contender, but I have taken issue with him since catching up with The Trial Of Christine Keeler on BBC.It’s a slightly schlocky take on the infamous Sixties scandal involving the Tory cabinet minister John Profumo, who had a sexual relationship with Christine when she was just  – at the same time that she was “romantically linked” with Russian spy Yevgeny Ivanov.James plays society osteopath Stephen Ward, who acted as a sort of posh pimp and introduced Christine to Profumo in the first place. He is super-creepy in the series, with an intensely irritating habit of calling Christine “little baby” in almost every sentence.If you watch the show and sink a drink every time he utters those annoying words, you will be sloshed about ten minutes into each episode.It has taken the shine off Mr Norton for me, so I’m afraid he has to go to the back of the Bond queue.I AM convinced that when The Masked Singer’s Octopus character takes off its head, it will be revealed as model actress singer Caprice.I have absolutely no insider knowledge and only say this because Caprice actually released a single in the late Nineties.While doing the promotion rounds, on GMTV she very gamely warbled her song on a freezing beach while wearing not very much – in one of that show’s many fabulously surreal segments.If Caprice could cope with all that, then dressing up as a giant, eight-tentacled creature that can squirt black ink from its bottom would be a breeze.HUGH GRANT, who was absolutely brilliant in Paddington , is entitled to his opinion, like everyone . But I take real issue with him perpetuating the myth that tragic Princess Diana was “effectively killed” by British tabloid newspapers.Diana died in an accident because she was being driven by a drunk and didn’t have her seatbelt fastened. She had been stripped of her HRH title, which meant she didn’t have proper security, while the car was being driven too fast in a bid to elude bottom-feeding French paparazzi.To say the British Press were purely to blame is outrageous. And as Hugh Grant’s accusation went unchallenged during his appearance on US TV, most Americans will take it as gospel.They tend to believe posh actors who speak with cut-glass, upper-class accents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They had tothey wanted any viewers at all.Without Auntie, I reckoned that naked commercialism would take over and, soon, we’d end up with television like they had in Italy or Spain.Hours of incomprehensible game shows followed by a shouty weathergirl in not much of a bikini.But then along came Volvo sponsors Sky Atlantic with a host of dramas in which a Swedish detective in a jumper would solve crimes by staring into a lake for six weeks. We loved them.And then there was Amazon and Netflix, who realised thatwe were going to give them our money, they’d better bloody well give us some brilliant, intelligent shows in . So they did.All of this meant thatwe had the cash, we could get home after work and watch Breaking Bad or Ray Donovan or Dexter, or The Man In The High Castle or The Last Ship, or Ozark, or a Swedish woman staring into another lake, or Game Of Thrones, or The Sopranos or The Wire or  or ­Billions, or True Detective.Or we could watch a skateboarding duck on The One Show.Then there’s football. Right now,you’re a fan, you must pay BT, Sky and Amazon to stay in touch.That’s expensive, especially as you are also forced to pay your licence fee for a service that offers almost no live football at all. Or decent sport of any kind.To fight back against the onslaught of choice, the BBC has announced that by  . . . ready . . . drum roll . . . two-thirds of its staff will be based outside London.So what  Sure, you can have a technology hub in Newcastle and locate your Sounds app in Salford butall the decisions are still being made in Islington, over a plate of nuclear-free, vegetarian peace kale, it won’t make any dference.The fact is that the BBC is effectively governed by the monoculture that is social media. It’s ­terried of offending Twitter, so it abides by the rules.Far-right politics are bad. Far-left politics are fine. Veganism is good. Donald Trump is not.You get the impression thatthe BBC made The Crown, the Queen would be played by that guy in a wheelchair from Countryfile and Prince Philip by Idris Elba.And all they’d ever talk about, because all anyone ever talks about on any BBC show, is bloody climate change.I know it’s very noble but after a while, it becomes wearing. And I find myself sitting there ­thinking: “Oh for God’s sake, can’t they just have sex ”No. Obviously, no one can have sex on the BBC because a baby might result. And babies need food which, of course, causes global warming.The BBC was set up to “inform, educate and entertain”. Not “lecture, bombard and lecture again”.It’s got to the point now where the only BBC programmes I regularly watch are Pointless and Match Of The Day.I can’t even bring myself to listen to Attenborough any more. In the past, it was: “Look at this amazing fish which can breathe through its anus.”Now, it is: “Look at this amazing fish that can breathe through its anus and which is threatened by climate change.”Soon, it’s entirely possible the licence fee will become voluntary and when it does, the BBC will quickly learn that to ­survive it must make shows people want to watch.That’s people everywhere, not just ­Twitter people in a Shoreditch juice bar.Killing Eve. Fleabag. Earth’s Tropical Islands. More of that.And less of everything .So it’s good to see Meghan’s still working hard on behalf of those with mental-health issues.I’LL be honest. When it seemed likely that Mr Corbyn would win the General Election, I briefly entertained the idea of emigrating.I figured that there’d be no point living in the UKthe Government was going to take all my earnings and savings in tax.I even went so far as to go online and look at properties for sale in Italy. They all looked lovely – old stone farmhouses with pools – and all for less than a one-bedroom flat in Harpenden.But then I started to think: “Hang on. I don’t have any friends or family in Italy, so in about two hours I’d be lonely.”Then, the next day I’d drown my loneliness with a lunchtime drink, and then another.I’d make a rule that there’d be no drinking before , but soon I’d make that am.And within a month, I’d be pouring red wine on my cornflakes. Within a year, I’d be in a hospital trying to say, in Italian, to a doctor: “Please can I have a new liver ”I’m telling you all this because Harry and Meghan probably think le will be peachy by the sea in Canada.But home is where your friends are.And Harry’s friends, at least, are in the UK. He’s going to miss them. A lot. I guarantee it.WE have learned from American news footage that when there’s a small flood or some wind, we must go on the news and wail like stuck pigs about the injustice of it all.It makes me so angry that even my hair starts to itch.So I was delighted this week to see that when some floods came to the area where Jodie Kidd lives, she simply rolled up her trousers and carried on as normal.It does help, mind you, that she’s taller than The Shard.FOR reasons known only to a lunatic, it would cost £, to ring the bell in Big Ben to celebrate our departure from the EU.Hmmm. Seeing as the tower is currently hidden behind a million tons of scaffolding, why doesn’t someone go up there with a CD player and some big speakers We’d never know.THERE was further proof this week that the stock market is mad and everyone involved with it is Wolf Of Wall Street bonkers.Because apparently, City types now give Tesla a higher valuation than Ford and General Motors combined.Even though the electric minnow takes three months to produce what the big boys produce in a week.And is run by a dope enthusiast who calls random strangers “pedos” on social media. And gets away with it.A FRIEND of mine was driving along a dual carriageway this week when his super-green hybrid BMW i decided to have an electric duck fit.The power steering and power brakes both failed and it was only by using Herculean force he was able to coast, eventually, to a halt on the grass verge.He tells me that BMW hopes to have the car back to him very soon.But he’s not sure he wants it. He reckons he’d be better off with the petrol-powered M they’ve lent him in the meantime. Can’t say I blame him, really.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not only is Brexit now sailing through Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly is back up and running after years in abeyance.Number  is now keen to get on with delivery.Ministers and advisers have been personally reminded that running their departments is far more important than appearing on television or ­talking to the media.Boris wants to restore the kind of Cabinet discipline we haven’t seen since the early Blair years. But moving forward also offers a chance to BRING THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER.As Boris’s great hero Winston Churchill used to say: “In ­victory, magnanimity.”At Prime Minister’s Questions this week, he took a much less confrontational style than usual.With everyone apart from the Labour and Scottish National Party leaders, he went out of his way to be generous and not score party-political points.Given that Boris likes to be liked, this is a more natural approach for him than being confrontational with every opposition MP.Boris wants to occupy the common ground. His approach to Brexit night on January  reflects that.Rather than being out with Nigel Farage and Co in Parliament Square, he will address the nation on this momentous moment from Downing Street.I am told the message will be upbeat but he will also try to reach out and reassure those who voted Remain. It would be tempting for Boris to join in some full New Year’s Eve-style celebration. And there are undoubtedly Leave voters who would love him to do just that.The danger is that this might alienate those who voted Remain but who have now reconciled themselves to the result and want to help the country pull together.What is key is that in the coming weeks, the Government shows it knows what it wants to do to improve voters’ lives. Boris must put meat on the bones of his plan to “level-up” infrastructure and opportunity across the country.He must show he knows not only how to keep the ­economy growing but how to get it out of second gear, which it has been stuck in — along with most of the West — since the financial crisis of .The next few months present a remarkable opportunity for the PM. He has a sizeable ­parliamentary majority and a united government, while both Labour and the Lib Dems are absorbed by their own leadership contests.This is his moment to really crack on.THIS week, the European Union Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said it is “just not possible” to conclude everything on the UK’s future relationship with the EU by the December  deadline for the end of the transition period.But the UK and the EU both agreed to that timeframe in the political declaration.The EU shouldn’t have signed up to itthey didn’t think it was possible to agree things by that date.Boris Johnson is determined not to extend this transition period.He feels the whole process has gone on too long already. So there needs to be some compromise to keep things moving.What is key is that at the end of this year the UK is no longer sending millions to the EU every day the UK determines its own immigration policy and the role of the European Court of Justice in the UK ends on all matters other than the rights of EU citizens.THE Royal Family is in its worst crisis since the death of Diana.By contrast, Boris Johnson is determined to stay out of the current drama.BORIS JOHNSON’S refusal of Nicola ­Sturgeon’s demands for a second Scottish independence ­referendum was definitive.But it will become very hard to ­continue to refuse those callsthe SNP wins a majority at next year’s Scottish Parliament elections, in a campaign dominated by the ­question of whether or not there should be a second referendum.On a list of things that could derail this Government, Scotland is very high up the list.The best way to stop that happening is for the Tories, along with the other unionist parties, to deny the SNP an absolute majority at Holyrood in .That will require the Government to pay more attention to ­Scotland and be more prepared to call out the SNP on its ­domestic policy failures.THE first public hustings of the Labour leadership contest take place today – and the race looks set to be hard fought.A survey this week putting Shadow ­Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey ­narrowly ahead has dented the idea that Shadow Brexit ­Secretary Keir Starmer has it in the bag. It doesn’t look like the contest is going to be a particularly comradely affair.The personal jabs are already coming and the election isn’t over until April. Starmer and Long Bailey are the two front- runners. The Tories believe both candidates provide them with opportunities.Long Bailey wants to continue the Corbyn project. She will not bring Labour back towards the mainstream of British politics. Starmer, though, is the architect of the parliamentary manoeuvring on Brexit and the second ­referendum policy that hurt Labour so badly in those Red Wall constituencies lost in the election.As one Tory grandee puts it: “If they go for Keir, they’re locking in a problem with those Leave-voting seats.”The dark horse is Lisa Nandy. She performed best in the hustings for Labour MPs, put in a far better performance with interviewer Andrew Neil than Jeremy Corbyn did and is picking up some interesting endorsements.The longer this contest goes on, the better she will do. But even Nandy is making missteps and ­providing the Tories with ammunition in the event she becomes leader.This week, she defended free movement. She claimed voters in towns of the North and Midlands weren’t really opposed to it.This flies in the face of the fact that so many of these places voted Leave in , then flipped to the Tories in last month’s “Brexit election”.Nandy won’t pay an immediate price for this misstep, as most Labour members are pro-free movement themselves.But her decision to speak out shows how focused the contest is on Labour’s “selectorate” and not the broader electorate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, we reveal some exclusive extracts.PEOPLE always ask me about the weirdest injuries I’ve seen.Well, I once went out to a man who claimed he had “snapped his k**b”.We whisked him off to hospital. I’m taking his word for it. I wasn’t going to start inspecting it.I’ve also been out to a fair few snapped banjo strings — or, more correctly, frenulums — which are the small tags of skin between the foreskin and the shaft of a penis.One minute someone is making sweet love, the next the sheets are covered in claret.We tell the patient to wrap their old chap in a tea towel and hop on the ambulance.You wouldn’t believe some of the nonsense we get sent to.I’ve heard of someone wanting an ambulance to be sent to resuscitate a dead pigeon, help find someone’s trousers, deal with a hedgehog in a garden, treat someone whose feet were bleeding from wearing new shoes and fix a dislodgedfinger nail.ONE Sunday afternoon, we get a call to a carvery restaurant. Our screen simply said: Male choking.When we swing the doors open, the waft of carvery — old, sweaty veg and cheap lager — almost knocks us backwards.Down his throat I can see a big piece of steak. I pull out my mini-Hoover and suck out the gravy, before pulling out my special forceps and fishing out the offending item.We ventilate the patient and a couple of minutes later he’s sat up talking. As we’re pushing him towards the exit, the whole restaurant erupts into cheering and clapping. I feel like an actor leaving the stage after a triumphant opening night.I COULDN’T tell you how many people I’ve seen dead on a toilet.It wasn’t just Elvis Presley who breathed his last on the throne. It’s so common, we call it the “death poo”.We went to one woman in a care home who died mid-evacuation. The family were on their way, so me and my partner lugged the woman over to the bed and tucked her in, so she looked nice and peaceful.SEEING my first dead body is etched on my mind. I thought people died with their eyes shut, but this guy is staring straight at the ceiling.I’m stood there thinking, “What happens next ”, when my partner does something humbling: He closes the man’s eyes.Back downstairs, my partner breaks the bad news to the dead man’s we: “Your husband has passed away in his sleep. He wouldn’t have known anything about it.”An ambulance person’s job isn’t just to treat the injured and sick. It is also to bring calm and dignity and counsel the bereaved.A MESSAGE comes though: Seven-week-old child, not breathing. cardiac arrest.I switch on the blue lights and floor it. We can only drive an ambulance mph over the limit, and it’s not a rule that’s usually flouted. But this particular job is a case of b******s to the rules.The baby is seven-weeks-old. It is white, floppy and bleeding from the nose.From arriving at the house to arriving at the hospital takes no more than three minutes.The dad had fallen asleep on his bed next to the baby, rolled over and suffocated it. The mum had been out with friends for the first time since her baby was born.After an hour of treatment, the decision is made to cease CPR. The mum screams again, “No! You can’t stop!” But the baby is dead. There is nothing more we can do.In my  years on the frontline, I’ve seen so many lives lost, but so many lives saved.THERE is a superstition in the ambulance service thatanyone says the word “quiet”, the s**t will ­suddenly hit the fan. So we call it “the Q word”, just as actors refer to Macbeth as “the Scottish play”.But there must have been a lot of ambulance workers forgetting ­themselves of late, because the s**t’s hitting the fan every day.Suffice to say that the state of the ambulance service scares me.When that ambulance arrives, I guarantee you will get the best treatment possible.But will it arrive too late  When I started there was a snooker table in the ambulance ­station.Now the calls wait for us and we don’t have time to go to the toilet, let alone make sure our ambulances are ship-shape.It’s not uncommon to be on a job, open a bag and discover something is missing.A JOB comes on our screen: Child fallen over in shower. Unconscious. I try the door and it’s locked. Suddenly, we hear the thud, thud, thud of big feet thundering down stairs. The door swings open to reveal a burly lad with a limp child in his arms.He says, “There you go, mate”, and shoves the child into my chest, asshe is nothing more precious than a pile of dirty washing. I can tell immediately that the girl, who is about two-years-old, has horrendous injuries.Her face is black and blue, as are her legs. Her eyes are half-closed, her pupils dilated and her breathing is noisy and slow. I hand the patient to my crewmate Paul, who can feel her body clicking, which suggests she also has broken bones. We both know something is seriously amiss, but we can’t say that.The doctors agree with us that the girl’s injuries are non-accidental. A short while later, the man is arrested. At home, I can’t shake the image of the little girl in my arms, covered in bruises, wheezing and gasping for breath. Several days later I heard that the girl had died and the man had been charged with murder.This pushed me further towards breaking point. I became more withdrawn at work. I stopped playing with my kids. I started drinking heavily to combat my anxiety and help me sleep. My doctor was so understanding and supportive. She signed me off work and referred me for counselling.The man changed his plea to guilty of manslaughter. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted he’d lost his temper and violently shaken her. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. It felt like this guy had got away with murder.IT wasn’t until I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD that I realised I was vulnerable — and that everyone was. I wrote and posted the first of many blogs, detailing my crash and subsequent road to recovery.I’d been back on the job for a few weeks when my blogs went viral, which was a bit embarrassing. But those blogs, and the responses to them, changed my le forever.Ambulance workers from all over the country sent me emails, thanking me for sharing my story.A COUPLE of months after ing to work, I’m in the ambulance with Paul and a job appears on our screen: Female Bleeding PV .Sprawled in the bath is a woman. There is blood everywhere. My initial thought is that it could be a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Or maybe it’s a miscarriage.But when I ask the guythere was a risk of pregnancy, he replies that there wasn’t. During his examination, the consultant has discovered a severed umbilical cord and delivered a nearly full-term placenta.Later, I learn that the police did find a baby, in a plastic bag in the hallway. Sadly, it was already dead. I didn’t really discuss the job with Paul.He seemed happy just plodding along and I took that to mean he was a stronger person than me. One evening I received a phone call from my manager.The whole time I’d been pouring my heart and soul into raising awareness of mental illness in the ambulance service, my mate had been sinking into an abyss.I’M tremendously proud to say I work for the service and I have a deep love for the job. It might not be the sexiest occupation, but it’s one of the most rewarding.How many people can say they arrived home late from work or missed their child’s sports day because they were saving someone’s le It’s a tough gig, but someone has to do it.

Hundreds gave the left-wing leadership hopeful a raucous welcome as she launched her campaign at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester - where she was first taken  years ago as a child. The Corbyn ally joked “guys, we’re going to have to think of a new song” after activists chanted “Oh, Becky Long-Bailey” to the tune of White Stripes hit Seven Nation Army. Surrounded by dozens of bright-lit screens bearing her name, she pledged to “unite, rebuild and win” after Labour ’s worst election defeat since . The Shadow Business Secretary said: “If someone had told me  years ago when I first came here that I’d be back in , standing on a podium telling you all I was going to be leader of the party and the next Prime Minister, I’d have thought I’d stumbled out of the Hacienda having taken something.” Ms Long-Bailey confirmed details of a key policy - scrapping the House of Lords. In its place would be an elected Senate, based outside London and voted in through proportional representation. Ms Long-Bailey was introduced by new MP Zarah Sultana, who this week described the last  years as “Thatcherism” and once said she would celebrate the death of Tony Blair . But Ms Long-Bailey praised Tony Blair’s election win in , saying on that day “you could literally see people with a spring in their step, with hope for the future again.” She vowed to fight for a string of policies from Labour’s failed election manesto - from “modern democratic public ownership” to a Green New Deal. But she attempted to shrug off claims she is the “Corbyn continuity candidate” - admitting the party needs “a new professionalism” after losing the trust of Jewish voters over anti-Semitism.  “We need to look like a government in waiting,” she admitted. She said members in Salford were faced with people on the doorstep who wouldn’t vote Labour due to the “crisis”. “They didn’t believe in us enough and we’ve got a lot of work to do to rebuild trust,” she said. A YouGov poll of members tonight put Ms Long-Bailey far behind rival Keir Starmer - on % to his % in the final round. Even ardent Corbyn supporter Ricky Tomlinson, the Royle Family star, swung behind Sir Keir. Asked why voters should back her instead of Sir Keir, Ms Long-Bailey said she could reunite communities that didn’t vote Labour despite suffering years of de-industrialisation. She added: “I’m not from Westminster. Not from the London bubble.”  Ms Long-Bailey said a lot of success was down to luck. “A lucky birth, a lucky break at work, a gamble that pays off.” And she said Labour should not wait until winning power to get change on the climate crisis. “We have to use our power as a movement to demand change. If we wait until , we know our time is running out”. The candidate ducked giving a firm answer on whether she would scrap private schools or decriminalise drugs. But she revealed more about her trip to Amsterdam - where she hinted she smoked cannabis. She said: “I’ll leave it to you to decide why I was in Amsterdam. “But it was either my inherent love of flower markets or it was to partake in the local delicacies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lisa nandy am labours next","story":"NewsopinionLisa Nandy: If I am Labours next PM, well tear up the UKs timid rulebookConsecutive Tory Governments have failed to find solutions to some big problems and now we need to revitalise our torn communities with a thriving local economyShareCommentsByLisa Nandy:,  JAN Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video lisa-nandy-says-labour-must-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics lisa-nandy-am-labours-next-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPolitics is actually quite simple – the problem is politicians complicate it. So let me be as clear as I can be. The case for committing the next Labour government to putting UK manufacturing and domestic steel first, couldn’t be clearer. It will create the decent jobs across the whole of the UK we desperately need. It will revitalise our communities which have seen manufacturing jobs lost and communities destroyed. It’s virtuous too – a thriving local economy contributes to an expanding UK economy. The more vibrant our economy the more money we will have to invest. At the moment, too many of the advantages of placing orders in the UK are ignored, including the taxation ed to the Treasury that is lost when contracts go overseas. If I am Labouraposs next PM we will tear up the UKaposs timid procurement rulebook, and we will buy British steel rebuilding our economy and public services while working within our international obligations. This will take the commitment to deliver what you believe and doing what’s right for UK jobs and UK manufacturing. What sort of message does it send about the value of our world-class steel industry when the Government only purchases half of its steel from UK steelmakers  How is it that industrial energy prices for UK steelmakers are double that of their French counterparts, and % higher than in Germany   The absence of political and corporate leadership has forced hard-working steelworkers to compete with one hand behind their backs, for a generation. Thousands of jobs have been lost - despite the best efforts of our unions, consecutive Tory governments have failed to find solutions and starved steel of investment for decades. Take a look at an active government contract, the building of the three support ships to the Royal Navy worth up to £. billion. According to research, awarding the contract to build these ships in the UK would generate over , UK jobs – jobs in steel manufacturing, jobs in mechanical engineering, jobs in electronics, jobs in shipbuilding. If I win the trust of the British people and become Prime Minister I will make sure that where we can build with British steel, we will. What could be more obvious, what could be more logical, what could be better for the UK and the manufacturing sector than these ships being built with British steel   Under my Government, they would be. By failing to have faith in our world-class industries, the Government are failing to be ambitious for our country. It’s also vital that our steel industry has the information and the time to deliver. For years now Conservative governments have been failing to share information about the big public projects that are coming on stream, and they then have no choice but to buy foreign steel because UK producers aren’t set up to make what is needed. As PM I will demand that this dialogue happens, right across Whitehall. Many of the areas that made up my party’s so-called red wall were from a proud steel-making tradition.  Not even the incredible work of incumbent Labour MPs could hold back the tide. For too long, too many in these small cities and towns felt disconnected from power and decision making. The industry they relied on too often cast aside by politicians in Westminster as an industry of the past by those who simply don’t understand its foundational importance to our economy.

Dean Reeves wrote in large black letters: Want your house painting  Don’t be like Terry, pay the bill! Now you will!” over the cream exterior he had painted. Dean, , claims builder Terry Taylor paid him just £ of the £, agreed price for the work. He says Mr Taylor refused to pay the rest until he had done additional work on the building. He claims he worked through his lunch for a week to get the job done on time on the former North Star Club in Bolsover, Derbys, which is being converted into flats. However, he says Mr Taylor told him he wouldnapost be getting paid the remainder of the cash until he gave the back of the house another coat.

He said there was a number of jobs I needed to do before I would get paid.  Dean says he took the drastic action two days after being told he was not going to get the £ he was owed. When contacted for comment, Mr Taylor has denied ripping Dean off and said he was going to pay in full once the work had been completed. Mr Taylor said: The bloke is a prat. He should have just done the work and he would have been paid in full. It’s standard. He wasn’t asked to do additional work, it was offset work by other jobs he was meant to do but didn’t. It was his idea, he said he would do some other jobs to offset what he wasn’t doing. He was getting paid the same to do less work.  I wasn’t going to pay him for the whole job until he finished it, no one would. I’ve spoken to police now. I found out about it last night but I’m completely unbothered. It’s just paint, the idiot.

Rashidul Islam was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court after pleading guilty to communicating  information. He was also banned from Gatwick Airport. The -year-old called police  minutes before his easyJet flight to Marrakesh from Gatwick was due to take off after his train was cancelled and his taxi became stuck in traffic on May  last year. His hoax call caused the flight to be evacuated and all  passengers having to be rechecked by security, costing the airline an estimated £,. A Crown Prosecution Servicespokesman said: Islam anonymously called police  minutes before his easyJet booking from Gatwick was due to take off, warning: aposSomeone may have a bomb on the plane, you need to delay the flightapos. The hoaxer made two further threats in the following minutes - causing crew on the .pm flight to Marrakesh to be evacuated and all  passengers to be checked again by security. Luggage also had to be removed and re-screened, resulting in a three-hour delay at Britainaposs second busiest airport on a bank holiday weekend. The spokesman continued: Islam, who was flying to Morocco to visit his fiancee, made the bomb hoax after experiencing transport dficulties en route to the airport from Cricklewood, north London. Islam first ran into transport dficulty when his train to Gatwick unexpectedly terminated at St Pancras. He instead took a taxi from the central London station but traffic meant he would have arrived at the airport with only minutes to get through security.  The hoax initially succeeded in giving Islam time to check in but he was arrested at the gate after police traced him as the anonymous caller. The flight eventually took off at .pm with a new cabin crew which had to be swapped as the previous crew had exceeded their hours because of the delay.Following his arrest, Islam told police he had panicked about missing his flight because he could not afford another ticket.Natalie Smith, of the CPS, said: Rashidul Islam suggests his  calls were simply a misguided solution to running late and not intended to cause genuine fear.But the bomb hoax was intended to make authorities fear there was a genuine enough threat that they needed to search the plane.

Claire Varin, from Leeds, claims children are being failed after she was taken to court for outing the neighbour. The mum-of-two told Leeds Live she was made to sign a non-disclosure form after discovering her new neighbour was a paedophile. Ms Varin was charged with breaching data protection laws - but the charge was dropped in May  as there wasnapost enough evidence against her to prosecute. The incident unfolded when she became suspicious after he knocked on their door and askedtheir eight-year-old daughter would like to go berry picking with him. Under Sarahaposs Law - officially known as the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme - members of the public can find outsomeone has a record for committing crimes against children. It was introduced following the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne, eight, by paedophile Roy Whiting, in . After becoming suspicious, Claire contacted West Yorkshire Police and discovered he had previously been jailed for possessing child abuse images. Under the conditions of Sarahaposs Law, Ms Varin was made to sign a non-disclosure form, preventing her from warning anybody . However, after her neighbours found out, she was taken to court. She said: It makes you question how effective the law is. Itaposs meant to be there to protect children, but we canapost share the information - technically you arenapost even supposed to tell your partner, although the police did accept I was going to do so to protect my children. The charges were eventually dropped, but following the ordeal, Ms Varin separated from her partner and moved away from the street she lived on.  She said: We were just left to deal with this information. We were told a paedophile had moved onto the street and we were expected to just live with it. The person who is disclosed to, how can you sit back and just watch them interact with children  You are just as bad then, it is on your conscience. The stress of it all meant I didnapost want to live there anymore. He refused to move out until just a few months ago, the -year-old carer added. All I had done was what anyone  would have done. Disclosures of children committing crimes against children have nearly doubled since the law was introduced in , rising from  a year to  annually, according to comparable figures obtained under freedom of information laws by Portsmouth Universityaposs journalism department. Out of the  forces, including the British Transport Police, in the UK,  ed comparable data, revealing at least , disclosures have been made to parents since . However, when including the partial data ed by some forces, figures suggest it could be much higher, with at least , adults informed someone close to their child has a history of sexual offences since .  Applications under Sarahaposs Law can be made by anyone, but the police will only inform the person who is able to protect the child. So, for example, a grandparent may enquire about their daughteraposs new partner, but the police would then inform the mother, not the grandparent,the partner was found to have a history of sexual offences. From the year the law was introduced to the last financial year, , applications were made by members of the public based on  police forces who supplied comparable data. However, incomplete data from other forces suggests the total number of applications from across this period was at least as high as ,. The proportion of applications that resulted in disclosure remained the same, at %, in both   and  .  forces ed comparable figures for the last three financial years, which show a % increase in applications over this period and a % increase in disclosures. Donald Findlater, director of child abuse helpline Stop It Now!, said it was reassuring to see the figures growing.  Mr Findlater, who sat on the  consulting with the government before the scheme became law, told PA: I think the rise is demonstrating a level of interest in safeguarding children and seeking information greater than we have had historically.I would like to see this trend continue because it is demonstrating awareness and vigilance. One in  children experience sexual abuse and one of the biggest problems is people are blind to the reality of it and think, aposit wonapost happen around hereapos. The fact that people are making the applications demonstrates to me that people are aware that the children they love and care about may be vulnerable to abuse. Evenan application does not result in a disclosure, those who enquired are given a pack with information about where to turnthey suspect abuse.

Deborah Alderton, , and her husband Richard, , said they paid extra for a Hideaway package, but the getaway to the Dominican Republic was anything but romantic. The couple, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said their original booking was cancelled before their wedding and on their way to their second choice, the all-inclusive Royalton Punta Cana Resort, a Tui rep repeatedly asked: Are you ready to party  Post Office worker Mrs Alderton claims she fell ill with a serious chest infection and suspected borderline pneumonia during the holiday, and was sent to a private clinic that wouldnapost treat her until she could prove her insurance would pay for it. Have you been on a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror.  Mrs Alderton told : It was such a shame. I waited a long time to meet my husband and our honeymoon was ruined. The hotel really emphasised the honeymoon element of their property and we thought it would be well worth the extra £, especially as Tui had cancelled our original trip. It turns out that it was wasted money. The Aldertonsapos honeymoon was a letdown even before they got married in November last year. They said their original hotel booking was cancelled four months before the holiday because construction work wouldnapost be finished before they arrived.  It left them stressed and scrambling to book another honeymoon, but there was limited choice and prices had risen by hundreds of pounds, they said. When they booked a room at the four-star Royalton Punta Cana Resort at an extra cost of £, a Tui rep promised a romantic honeymoon experience, they claim. But when they arrived they allegedly had to wait  minutes for a Tui transfer to pick them up and the coach next to them was full of bullet holes, said Mrs Alderton. She said: We were exhausted after a nine-hour flight and we had to wait so long to catch our bus transfer. When I saw the bullet holes I felt frightened. My husband and I were desperate to start our romantic honeymoon, but the Tui representative just repeatedly said, aposAre you ready to party apos It was sadly an omen of things to come. The Aldertons said they finally arrived at the hotel four hours after landing, but staff couldnapost find their booking in the computer system and it took an hour to find their reservation. Mrs Alderton added: We just felt lost. I even went directly to the separate Hideaway reception myself, but they just seemed confused.  She said she burst into tears when she walked in and saw that the room overlooked a block of toilets and bins. They were disturbed by the constant noise of bottles smashing, rubbish being thrown into the bins and people passing by. They were given a room in a lower class after they demanded a change.  Mrs Alderton said the next day she began to feel unwell with a chest infection and was charged £ for an appointment with a doctor at the hotel. But, she claims, she couldnapost be treated there due to the severity of her condition and the doctor directed her to a private clinic surrounded by high-security fencing. Mrs Alderton said her chest infection was diagnosed quickly, but the clinic refused to provide any treatment until it had a guarantee of payment from her insurance company. Five hours later, she was told she likely had borderline pneumonia, she claims.  She said she didnapost feel comfortable at the clinic and she wanted toto the hotel, but she had to wait two hours for a prescription. Back at the hotel, the Hideaway pool was full of drunken guests and it hosted raucous foam parties with a DJ playing booming music. Mrs Alderton said: It was definitely more of an - party style hotel. We have no idea why they advertised it as romantic. The Aldertons have now instructed the law firm Bott and Co to pursue a claim for compensation.  The furious newlyweds claim they were mis-sold a holiday. Mrs Alderton said: We feel completely betrayed by Tui. This was meant to be our dream holiday to start our happily ever after. You donapost expect to have to fight for your honeymoon. We had originally paid £,, then paid an extra £. Itaposs an awful lot of money to us. David Bott, Senior Partner at Bott and Co, said: Itaposs a great shame that Deborah and Richard had a honeymoon experience that was endured more than it was enjoyed.  They are wondering aposwhat apos about the honeymoon they could have had, which Tui cancelled without a momentaposs thought. We are exploring the possibility that Tui breached their contract with the Aldertons in not giving them a hotel that was of a similar standard or superior to their original hotel, especially as Deborah and her husband has to pay an extra £ for the holiday. The Royalton Punta Cana Resort has overwhelmingly positive reviews online and advertises evening entertainment such as parties, bars and a casino. The hotel cost cost more than £ than the Aldertonsapos original booking, so Tui covered the dference and offered the honeymoon suite, it is understood.

Jacob Young, , raped and strangled his victim, , in her own home until she was almost unconscious, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Young followed his victim and boyfriend home after the couple had been on a night out and struck after seeing the man leave the flat to go to work. The judge said Young had an extreme form of sexual curiosity or unhealthy fantasy, BBC reports. Young stalked vulnerable young women and took photographs of them on October  last year, when he saw his victim being mistreated by her boyfriend. His defence said Young had intended on helping the woman get home safely but the jury found he executed a apospremeditated planapos to steal her handbag thenit appearing as a hero. The victim hinted that Young enjoyed the violence and she only escaped after she promised him he could do whatever to mehe let her go to the bathroom. Youngaposs family appeared on Supernanny in , where the parents were told the boys had no respect. Judge Levett added: Your mother said appearing on that TV programme led to a campaign of mockery and abuse from the public and peers and school friends. His mother wrote a letter to the court, describing him as someone with good character and said her children had been subjected to a campaign of mockery from the public and peers after featuring on the show.  She went on to say that her son was protective of women ever since a fire that happened in their family home in , which was allegedly started by Youngaposs younger brother. Although she said her son was of good character, the judge dismissed her letter as aposembellishmentapos. Young was sentenced to  years with an extended licence period of five years. His sentence will be served in a Young Offenderaposs Institute. Investigating officer Sgt Rory Prior from the Safeguarding Unit said: I am extremely pleased to see Young behind bars after being handed this sentence.

Many of us will remember the daunting feeling of waiting for the examiner to reveal your fate as they counted the tally marks on your test report. In the UK,  per cent of people fail their driving test on the first attempt and more than a million people don’t pass until the sixth try. Where you take your driving test is usually down to where you live but according to new data provided by car company Peter Vardy, anyone taking their driving test in London, Manchester, Liverpool or Birmingham face slim odds of passing. Using the pass rate of each test centre, the study reports that learner drivers trying their chances at winning their license at the Erith Test Centre in London face the worst odds in the country and have just a . per cent chance of passing.  This means that one in seven hopeful drivers fail according to statistics.  Erith is closely followed by test centres in other areas such as Sutton Coldfield, Rochdale, Speke, South Yardley and Wanstead which all have less than an  per cent pass rate for drivers desperate to ditch their L-plates.  Those taking their tests in more rural areas of the UK fare much better and experts suggest that it might be due to the likelihood of driving on quieter roads than the ones found in larger metropolitan areas. Anyone struggling to pass in London or Manchester should perhaps try their fate in Yeovil in Somerset where the local test centre boasts a pass rate of . per cent.  Test centres in Ipswich, Dundee, Ashfield and Durham all have high pass rates too, with each passing well over half of test takers.  Why drivers fail their practical tests is down to a number of dferent factors which y from nerves, to lack of practice, lack of confidence and lack of skill. In a report published by the DVSA, the most popular reason for failing a test is poor observation at junctions and unsatisfactory use of mirrors.  This led , learner drivers to fail between December  and December .  Peter Vardy found that . per cent of Brits found parallel parking the most dficult element of the practical test and this was confirmed by the DVSA who have revealed that the failure to complete a parallel park is one of the top  reasons why learners fail.  The practical exam is not the only element of learning to drive though the theory test is just as important as the practical but unfortunately, . million of us needed three attempts to pass."},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron evacuated theatre after","story":"NewsEmmanuel Macron evacuated from theatre after mob of protesters try to break inOne political activist was believed to have been arrested after calling for anti-government protesters to rush into the Bouffes du Nord theatre in ParisShareCommentsByPeter AllenTfany Lo:,  JAN NewsFrench president Emmanuel Macron was seen inside the Bouffes du Nord theatre\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Gathering around the pitul corpse of the magnicent black bear they have just slaughtered, the bloodthirsty group smile triumphantly asproud of their pointless kill.However, such sickening scenes are not unusual on Vancouver Island in Canada – where Prince Harry is to join we Meghan and son Archie to start their new le outside the royal fold.Hunting operators encourage youngsters to take up the vile hobby. One of many firms on the island even touts hunting trips for  to -year-olds to encourage “a future generation of hunters”. The company, Canadian Guide Outfitters, displays disturbing images on its website of a number of youngsters posing with the bodies of the huge bears they have killed. One even shows a boy who looks no older than  holding up a dead bear’s paw in triumph. It will horry animal-lover Meghan, , who has made no secret of her distaste for hunting. On her first Christmas with the royals in , Prince Harry missed the family’s annual Boxing Day hunt at Balmoral, with a royal source saying: “Meghan is a keen animal rights campaigner and doesn’t like hunting in any form.” But sadly it is a fact of le on the beautul island that she has adopted as her temporary new home. Hunters from all over the world travel to Vancouver Island to shoot its fearsome black bears, making Canada the “global capital” of the trophy-hunting industry. One company, Diana Hunting tours, offers a five-day trip for £, and boasts on its website: “In this hunting district you will have a great chance to shoot the bear of your dreams. “It is not unusual to shoot a black bear of over seven feet in height and weighing over kg [st lb]. On springtime hunts you can expect to see between five to  bears on an average day hunting. The autumn hunts coincide with the annual salmon run in the island’s rivers. “At this time the bears are extremely active, feeding to put on weight before their winter hibernation.  “Extremely nutritious food sources such as salmon help the bears to grow very large.” Bloodthirsty customers can shoot the bears with ease from boats when the animals go to the river for food. A review on the website of one operator, North Island Guide Outfitters, said: “We are happy hunters. What great bears we all three shot. We have had a big smile on our face for a week now. We all had a great time.” Campaigners have blasted hunting companies for revelling in the slaughter of black bears, which is not illegal because they are not endangered. The Mirror is campaigning to outlaw the vile hobby and to ban hunters from bringing their sick souvenirs back to Britain. Eduardo Goncalves of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting said: “The conservation status of a fun-hunted species is irrelevant – trophy hunting is wrong, pure and simple. Andblack bears aren’t endangered now, they soon will betrophy hunting continues. “Trophy hunters always like to go after the biggest male bears.  “This skewing of the gender ratio of adult populations has been found in polar bears to seriously affect the numbers of cubs born. “You’re also taking the best genes out of the gene pool. This means the species is more prone to diseases and being affected by environmental conditions such as climate change. “It’s happened to polar bears and looks to be happening to brown bears too. It’s only a matter of time before the same happens to black bears.” It is estimated that between , and , black bears were shot for sport over the past decade and bear-hunting is the most popular form of trophy hunting on the planet. Almost , trophies of bears were taken home by hunters in  alone, according to the latest available figures from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Mr Goncalves added: “Thanks to the huge numbers of black bears hunted every year, Canada is actually the global capital of the trophy hunting industry.  “More hunting trophies are exported from Canada than any other country, even South Africa. “In some cases, bears are being hunted supposedly for trophies but in reality for their gall bladders, which often find their way into Asian markets. Here they are turned into pseudo-medicinal products. “There is a huge push by the trophy-hunting industry to get young children involved. The average age of the trophy hunting community is going up as its social acceptability falls.  “So the industry is desperately trying to recruit youngsters in order to keep itself going.” British Columbia banned the hunting of grizzly bears in  but the hunting of black bears is not prohibited. According to a  assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, black bear numbers are increasing and, thanks to this, Canada is the world’s biggest exporter of hunting trophies.  While US citizens are still the biggest customer, a fast-growing number of Chinese hunters are travelling to North America to shoot black bears. In , % of all black bear trophies ended up in China and Hong Kong. Mr Goncalves added: “There is evidence to suggest trophy hunting is acting as a front for illicit trade in gall bladders, which are popular with the Asian traditional medicine market. “CITES records show that almost , galls and gall bladders were traded under the guise of bear trophies in recent years. “Most were from black bears, but some were from brown and even polar bears. Some of these ‘trophies’ made their way directly to known gall ‘medicine’ markets including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong. The biggest shipment – a single consignment of , galls – went from Russia to Lithuania.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds shortest mobile man khagendra","story":"NewsWorlds shortest man who can walk Khagendra Thapa Magar dies aged just Khagendra Thapa Magar, from Nepal, gained worldwide fame and became the face of tourism for his homeland when he became the worlds shortest man who could walk when he turned  in ShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video worlds-shortest-man-ft-in-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news worlds-shortest-mobile-man-khagendra-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees. Even Dominic Booth, Abellio UKrsquos managing director, said: lsquoScotlandrsquos railway needs stability, not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring aboutrsquo. I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world. This is after Miami, Las Vegas and Dubai, and it sits well above th placed London. Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well. It will be a modern fit for the future school."},{"url":null,"title":"work-start-three-new-social-housing-developments","story":"BOSSES at Scottish Borders Housing Association have announced that work

ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The council has launched a public consultation on Haddington town centre parking and transportation and this included an exhibition which showed images of people parking outwithallocated spaces in the current -space long-stay car park which is linked to Tescorsquos own short-stay customer car park.Under the heading ldquoindiscriminate parking, the images showed cars and vans parked on kerb corners and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay car park attached to the neighbouring Tesco supermarket."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-electric-bridge-closure","story":"The Electric Bridge in Musselburgh was built to carry traffic

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Labour is all for multiculturalism, but finds it hard in practice, even with racial identity. As the Labour leadership candidates lined up in all their glory yesterday, I was tempted to say, as Jon Snow of Channel  News said of that Brexit march last year: ldquoIrsquove never seen so many white faces.Only Lisa Nandy can legitimately claim ethnic descent from her father. Such a visual contrast to all those United Colours of Corbyn photo ops during the election.A party which has made a religion of ersity seems set to hand the leadership to Sir Keir Starmer, a wealthy North London barrister, who looks the very image of ldquowhite male privilege that Labour supporters on Twitter love to loathe.For a party that lectures the media, business and academia on gender, the leadership is turning into an intersectional embarrassment. Labour has never had a woman leader, and doesnrsquot seem likely to get one this time. Four out of the five candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn are female, but the straight white guy is ahead by a mile.Mind you, Mr Starmer, as he would like us to call him, has been given a free pass by some feminists on the grounds that he is the ldquohot ticket. According to commentators like Zoe Williams in the , Sir Keir bears a striking resemblance to Marc Drsquoarcy, the austere-but-sexy human rights lawyer played by Colin Firth in the Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary film franchise.In the salons of North London, this apparently makes the Labour MP less pale, male and stale, and more pale, male and phooar. Mind you, I donrsquot think his looks will set many hearts a-throbbing in the pubs and clubs of Workington and Bolsover.As Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir was largely responsible for turning Labour into the Remain Party before the General Election. He made clear he would never support even a Labour Brexit. That convinced tens of thousands of le-long Labour voters to turn to Mr Johnson on the grounds that only the Tories were listening to them.But thatrsquos all water under the bridge now. Itrsquos time to ldquomove on. Forget Brexit. After all, Labour won the argument, didnrsquot they Aware of the Islington millionaire tag, Sir Keir has been trying to burnish his working class image.

Labour should be choosing the candidate best able to lead the party to victory, on merit, rather than someone who fits a hackneyed image of proletarian virtue. Race should be irrelevant in a party that believes in equality.But of course in the Labour Party of today it so obviously does matter. Labour has been hypnotised by identity politics and sees everything through racial and gender eyeglasses. It requires of other organisations that ious minority and gender boxes are ticked. But when it comes to their own leader, well, itrsquos complicated. And when it comes to Scotland, itrsquos more complicated still.Ms Phillips is essentially standing as the only leadership candidate who speaks the language of the working class. ldquoI love the people I grew up among, she says, ldquoand I think that they can tell.

It was anticipated he would receive no more than pound, per year in the role which was to look at opportunities for growth but TLG did not want him directly involved in Barrhead Travel work.But the tribunal heard that TLG chief executive Ninan Chacko had become \"alarmed\" that Mr Munro was averaging seven hours per day which \"exceeded what had been expected\" and had focussed \"almost entirely\" on Barrhead Travel activities.Barrhead Travel TV advert from By May, , Mr Munro was given a -hours-a-month contract was offered with maximum pay of pound a month and his responsibilities were for projects directed by TLGs global head of supply relationships, Andrew Winterton.Mr Munro said he had \"quite a lump in my throat\" when the contract stated there would be no period of continuous employment.The findings of fact document said Mr Munro felt he was being asked to \"effectively forego\" the last  years of continuous service in exchange for a fresh start under the new arrangement.The following month, TLG told Mr Munro of Mr Chackos preliminary view that there was no longer a need for a chairman and that during a consultation process he would be informed of any alternative roles that may be on offer to avoid making him redundant.:Boss of firm who bought Barrhead Travel planned to sack founderBy July he had been made redundant as chairman of Barrhead Travel, and received a payment of pound, while being offered work on special projects on a consultancy basis.Mr Munro appealed saying he found it impossible to continue with special projects while at home, and argued he still had something to contribute to Barrhead Travel.

It was a wonder that anyone was surprised.Glasgow will host up to  world leaders and , delegates.Its due to be the largest policing operation the UK has seen - this sort of thing doesnt come cheap.Calum Steele, the General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, spoke positively about the event on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning, saying there had been nothing like it in Scotland or even the UK before.Mr Steele described it asmore signicant than the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games and would require the largest mass mobilisation of UK police the country has seen.The G summits, he said, \"will pale into insignicance.\"He went into further details. Police Scotland will be unable to manage the event alone. The country will host leaders from the US, Russia, China and Israel, all of whom will demand their own safety and security considerations.Alongside leaders, delegates and guests, the police service has to accommodate hundreds of protestors. Economic opportunities must be leapt on, he added. Scotland will be in the \"spotlight of the world for those two weeks.\"He pointed to the very clear potential economic benefits for Glasgow and for Scotland.Yet even Mr Steele, after these positive sentiments, yesterday on Twitter shared a video of buckets collecting water pouring through the roof of Paisley Police Office. \"Itrsquos not unreasonable to ask,\" he posted alongside the image, \"If we canrsquot even fix a roof how the hell will [COP] be paid for \"Nicola Sturgeon has called for Westminster to honour a pledge made to fund the event, given the UK is the host.Conversely, GMB Scotland called for Glasgow to reject the chance to host the summit. Its secretary, Gary Smith, said the costs would \"sicken frontline council staff and struggling local communities.\"\"The best thing government could do for Glasgow,\" he said, \"Is to ditch hosting the COP and instead invest the money in dealing with the state of the city.\"Its hardly the London Garden Bridge project, which, in case weve forgotten, saw poundm wasted, including pound, on a gala for the abandoned scheme. If nothing , it all served to show the strength of positive feeling towards Joanna Lumley, a vocal campaigner for this extraordinary white elephant, as she should surely have lost her national treasure status over the shameful incident.There is a string of other grossly wasteful examples of public funds. In  it emerged the frequently delayed NHS  new telecommunication and patient information system was going to cost poundm more than originally forecast.The HS railway plans have been described as at risk of becoming \"a bottomless pit for taxpayersrsquo money\". Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs last year that taxpayers were picking a bill of an poundm for two CalMac ferries, which look likely to be delivered four years late, due to \"disastrous\" previous management at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow.There was much back and forth over whether the legacy of Glasgows Commonwealth Games was all it was cracked up to be. The taxpayer spent pound. million on Glasgow  and all anyone remembers is the dancing teacake, it goes.There lies part of the problem. The public is used to politicians chucking its money away - whether on good faith projects such as the Games or ludicrous Boris Johnson vanity projects.Its important that the spending of taxpayers money is carefully scrutinised and those responsible for the mismanagement of publicly funded projects held to account.The public is protective of its taxes, people work hard and want afor their investment, and they do not automatically trust politicians to use their money wisely. Hence the almighty stooshie over Glasgows Lord Provost spending her civic allowance on shoes.Hence repeated grumbles when politicians head off on so-called junkets abroad. Last year the First Minister received pelters after travelling to Paris and straight on to North America.This was at the same time Lib Dem MP Angela Smith referred to people of a \"funny tinge\". My personal preference is for outward-looking politicians who want to make strong global links... not those who blurt out racist epithets without a second thought.Climate change is the most important issue of the day and this is an extraordinary chance for Glasgow, Scotland and the UK to be seen to be leading the way.Squabbling over the costs of policing an event with myriad economic opportunities for the city is such an insular, short sighted way of thinking.This is an international event and we must think internationally. It may be costly but the one thing we cannot afford is to be parochial when all eyes are on us, finally, for something of global importance."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-introduce-laws-tackling-unregulated-beauticians","story":"Such procedures are currently not regulated and can be carried out by anyone.In a consultation document, the Government said there is a ldquogrowing risk as the number of unregulated premises ndash including beauty salons, aesthetic clinics, hairdressers and pharmacies ndash offering the treatments is increasing.:Celebrity culture and social media fuelling rise in young Scots using injectable tan and steroidsThe paper highlights the potential for the procedures to go wrong and the possibility that permanent damage can be caused.Ministers plan to bring in legislation to introduce a licensing scheme for people who are not healthcare professionals and carry out non-surgical treatments which penetrate the skin.They have stopped short of a ban, despite the Scottish Cosmetic Interventions Expert Group effectively calling for such a move by saying the procedures should only be provided ldquoon or behalf of a regulated healthcare professional.The consultation document states: ldquoWe consider that a blanket ban on non-medical professionals carrying out non-surgical cosmetic procedures could be dficult to enforce and might drive unregulated providers underground.In , the law was changed to ensure independent clinics run by a doctor, dentist, nurse, midwe or dental technician had to register with Healthcare Improvement Scotland before they could legally provide cosmetic procedures.The Scottish Government wants pharmacies to be included in this group as part of the proposed legislative changes.Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ldquoWe are committed to patient safety and want to ensure that all those who carry out non-surgical procedures, such as dermal fillers or lip enhancements, are competent and that the treatments take place in safe and hygienic premises.:Keeping the cowboys out of cosmetic treatmentsldquoWe plan to introduce regulations later this year and invite members of the public and interested parties to give their views as part of the consultation on our proposals.ldquoIn the meantime, we urge anyone considering any kind of cosmetic surgery to visit the Health Improvement Scotland website for regulated and approved providers.The consultation opened on Friday and runs until the end of April."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-airport-celebrates-record-year-thanks-new-international-routes","story":"The airport celebrated its busiest year in history with ,, passengers travelling through, up . per centon .December passenger figures for  were also up on the same month the previous year, rising . per centto ,,.:Glasgow Airport to fly worlds largest passenger plane on year-round routeThe international market saw a . per centincrease on December , with strong growth in the short-haul segment.However, the domestic market was down . per centon December  after Ryanair cut the Stansted route from October  and Flybe stopped operating its route to East Midlands that month.Edinburgh Airport said it had the busiest ever year for a Scottish airport.Chief executive Gordon Dewar said: ldquoWersquore delighted to deliver a record year for any Scottish airport as passengers continued to take advantage of new routes, new airlines and the opportunity to expand their horizons and travel the world.ldquoWe never lose sight of the fact that the airport is a conduit to a whole host of things.

CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising.

I think I finally wore him out!”Sharon was tasked with cleaning out cages, the floors and vans.“They gave me all the dirty jobs to try put me off, but it didn’t work,” she said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.stornowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Heros welcome...family and friends met Mark Calder at the Forth Bridges to celebrate his achievement, on the final leg of his mammoth Running Home  challenge.\"  Scottish charity worker surpasses his £, Running Home target viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"A year later, she worked at the centre every weekend and during the school holidays, earning her first wage of £ per fortnight in February .She has remained with the SSPCA ever since, albeit moving up the ranks!But Sharon never ever wanted to become an inspector for her the job was all about working with the animals in their care.She said: “I’ve always had a love and passion for animals but didn’t just want to have a pet I wanted to work with and help look after them.“Originally, I thought of becoming a vet but when you start having boyfriends, that goes out the window!“I already had a job with the SSPCA which I loved anyway so I just decided to work there instead.“I never wanted to be an inspector, though, because to me the best bit of the job is helping animals that come in to us and then seeing them rehomed. “That to me has always been more fulfilling than dealing with what the inspectors have to tackle.“They don’t have much contact with the animals once they take them to the centres so that was never going to be my job.”After leaving school, Sharon became a kennel maid at the Rosebank Centre.In , she became the manager and three years later she oversaw the move to bigger premises at Petterden where she remained at the helm until .She then moved to the SSPCA’s HQ in Dunfermline as the superintendent.She now oversees all the centres across Scotland which, while involving a lot of paperwork and staffing issues, still enables her to build relationships with the animals in their care.For it is a love of animals that has led Sharonto devote the last  years to the SSPCA – and she plans to continue for a few years yet.She joked: “I’ve told my husband David that I’m going to retire in three years’ time, once I’ve worked with the SSPCA for  years. If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"spectacular year of firsts for snh","story":" was a spectacular year for Scottish Natural Heritage#snature reserves, including Forvie.At Forvie, the UK’s oldest ever arctic tern was found: first ringed as a chick at Buddon Ness in Angus, the tern was discovered at the SNH nature reserve in Aberdeenshire and found to be  years old, almost to the day.An average tern lives for only about  years.Forvie also celebrated the grand achievement of  years as a national nature reserve this year.The reserve is one of Scotland’s natural treasures, a place of stark beauty.Covering almost , hectares, it is part of one of the most extensive sand dune systems in Britain and a haven for wildle like breeding eider ducks, four species of terns, many waders and wildfowl, as well as grey seals.For SNH  also included the first-ever black grouse displaying at Beinn Eighe a flowering of aspen trees at Muir of Dinnet for the first time in almost  years a fth record-breaking year for visitors to the Isle of May and , walkers, cyclists and runners flocking to Loch Leven.Black grouse are an endangered species, so their first-time appearance at Beinn Eighe- Scotland’s oldest national nature reserve-this spring was a signicant sign of how the species is faring in the area.The year got off to a remarkable start at Muir of Dinnet in early March with the flowering of aspen trees –the first time since  for a large-scale aspen flowering in Scotland.Stuart MacQuarrie, SNH’s Head of Nature Reserves, said: “Scotland’s national nature reserves are special places for wildle.“But they are also wonderful spots to visit, enjoy a spectacular view and catch sight of an elusive otter or amazing eagle.“Making sure our nature is thriving is also part of the solution to the climate emergency.

HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nine miles I tell you – that’s a Sunday School trip with juice and crisps in your packed lunch box before you even think about running along the West Sands to the strains of Vangelis.: General election: Why I’m scunnered with politics these days – Kevan Christie: After  years, I can finally say it: I hate golf – Kevan ChristieThis carry-on, which is straying into ‘a piece of nonsense’ territory, came to the picturesque Fe mining village of Crossgates where I live the other day.No sooner had I left the grounds of the estate in the Toyota Auris,  plate, than I ran into three sets of temporary traffic lightsthat had turned Main Street into a scene reminiscent of the final hours of the Battle of Stalingrad.Humbug Park, Divito’s and Crystal CornerPanic-stricken white van drivers had abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the road as they rushed to the takeaway to get their daily fix of Lorne sausage on a roll.Squads of workers in high-vis jackets crowded round a small transistor radio eagerly waiting to hear what song Ken Bruce had chosen to kick-off his .am Radio  show with before gathering again to listen to the PopMaster quiz at half-ten. Doing anything but working as they let their young hearts run free.Motorists had time to run into the chemist and pick up a prescription in the time it took for the TTLs to change colour. Utter carnage.The cause of all this consternation was the arrival of a fleet, well two... OK one, articulated lorry dropping off building materials at a new development called Crossgates, Dunfermline.This got the old tether up as, to my knowledge, Crossgates has never been in Dunfermline – although I’m sure some parish boundary pedant will be digging out the ancient scrolls in an attempt to justy the unjustiable.We’re a self-proclaimed People’s Republic in ‘The Gates’ with our own shop selling crystals – Crystal Corner – and we’re also home to The Crystal Bar, a target shooting shop, a hairdresser called Kutz for U and the best ice-cream shop in the world – Divito’s.Our football team are Crossgates Primrose who play at the beautully named Humbug Park where Scotland legend Jim Baxter first graced the turf.So you can keep Dunfermline with their Pars, fancy Abbey, Robert the Bruce and his Spiders from Mars.I may add that none of the above have paid me in cash for the shameless plugs and the four boxes of Caramel Wafers I received are on the cusp of their sell-by date, give or take a day or two,No plug for property developersBut the property developers – who shall remain nameless – have felt compelled to attach the name of the nearest big toon to the new houses in the hope this attracts the aspirational . children brigade and their funny wee yappy dugs. “Be gone with your toonie ways – there’ll be no avocado on toast in my backyard.”The area around Dunfermline has doubled in the last few years with no end of new builds springing up in the Duloch Park suburb – which is handyyou’re looking for next-day deliveries from the Amazon warehouse just off the M and a manageable commute to Edinburgh. They also have their own giant Tesco for the milk and maltesers. “Come to Duloch, where dreams are made.”It sometimes takes a while for things like medical practices and schools to catch up when developers decide to create a small town in a field in the middle of nowhere but residents will be spoiled for choice when the inevitable fast-food outlets arrive ahead of the game.All of these shenanigans remind me of a friend from the old country over there in Embra, where this kind of stuff really matters, who told everyone he was from posh Ravelston as he shared the same EH postcode as them.The fact that he lived a stone’s throw from his local The Doo’Cot Pub in sunny Drylaw mattered not a jot as he fancied a better class of pigeon that hung around the “bought hooses” up the road.Upper DuddingstonMy friend and I also like to tell people “we’re old Academy boys” and enjoy watching the confused look on their faces as they try to work out how you can talk like that after going to Edinburgh Academy when we really mean the Leith version.Duddingston and Corstorphine are just two of many ‘desirable’ areas of the Capital that are rapidly expanding with estate agents quick to crowbar anywhere within a five-mile radius into their listings.So, the perfectly decent housing estate of Magdalene becomes Upper Duddingston and similarly Clermiston is incorporated into Corstorphine in the minds of the deluded to whom these things matter.I recently heard the Bellevue area described as North New Town which is a bit of a leap in terms of increasing property values.We can all laugh at this status anxiety and I’m sure everyone can name an area from their part of the country where this exists – a network of spam valleys.Conversely, hipster types look to the more edgy parts of town like Leith in the hope of gaining a bit of street cred and I’m starting a campaign to make Piershill trendy.My last bit of advice folks is to keep your eyes peeled for this type of shenanigans andyou see a sign for new builds that’s been vandalised with marker pen changing “near” to “nowhere near”, it wisnae me.

I am sure many thousands do. I am equally certain many thousands do not.Personally, the prospect of a second, isive ballot over whether my country should be split apart fills me with dread.I cannot bear the flag waving, the visceral hatred that explodes into le when our political debate is rooted in nothing more than identity.: A lesson for Nicola Sturgeon about politics and prostitution – Susan Dalgety: Susan Dalgety: Can we bet the farm on equality reform We got a glimpse of that earlier this week, when Lisa Nandy, one of Labour’s four female leadership candidates, suggested that social justice can overcome narrow nationalism, citing Canada and Catalonia as examples of where this has happened in recent years.Scotland’s speaker’s corner – Twitter – erupted with accusations that Nandy, one of the more thoughtful politicians around, was, with her reference to Spain, advocating state brutality against supporters of Scottish independence.Social justiceOne newly elected SNP MP, Kenny MacAskill, even tweeted a black-and-white image of British soldiers arresting an Irish nationalist at gun point, with the question “Would Lisa Nandy as a Labour MP a century ago have supported the Black and Tans”.At that point I switched off my phone. Instead I got to wondering, what do women in Scotland really want My wish-list soon filled up. Equal pay, now and not in  years’ time. Childcare that doesn’t cost more than the average wage. Healthcare that recognises that the women’s physiology is dferent from men. More public toilets. An education system that properly recognises – and nurtures – dferent abilities.I could go on. Achieving social justice is so much more complex than re-writing a constitution, but perhaps what women in Scotland – and where – want, above all , is simply this. Respect.When an experienced, expert woman says she is thinking of running for national office, she doesn’t want her long-time political colleague to dismiss her ambition with a snarky “a woman can’t win”, as happened to presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren when she told her old friend, now rival, Bernie Sanders of her desire to become leader of the free world. And she certainly doesn’t want him to publicly deny ever saying such a thing, effectively dubbing her a lying woman.All Elizabeth Warren wants is a little respect.Single-sex safe spacesWhen a rich, successful African American woman moves to a new country, changes career and tries to build a new le with her Prince Charming, she doesn’t expect to be greeted by a toxic mix of snobbery and racism, as Meghan Markle found when she married into the British establishment.I am sure the Duchess of Sussex didn’t want any special treatment when she moved to the UK, but I am sure she expected more than a little respect.And when women, theand breadth of Scotland, express concern about the Government’s plans to make it easier for men to legally become women, they don’t want to be dubbed transphobic. Or right-wing. Or zealots.They want their experience as women and girls to be believed. They want their Government to take their views as seriously as those of teenage boys who are flirting with changing their identity. They want to be respected.When women say that they don’t want their daughters to share a school toilet with hormonal teenage boys, it is not because they are bigots.It is because they remember the anxiety of dealing with the bloody mess of menstruation in a tiny cubicle, inches away from a crowd of shrieking girls.How much more terrying must that experience be,at  you’re forced to change a tampon in a space full of booming blokes.When women say they want single-sex safe spaces, such as refuges, protected for women only, it is not because they lack sympathy for a trans-woman who has been abused. It is because they recognise that abused women need an environment where they can heal, without sharing it with someone of the opposite sex.‘Profoundly dangerous’Because at the heart of this public debate is an essential truth that we are sometimes too frightened to say out loud, for fear of offending, or worse, being dubbed a fiend.Sex is real. Some humans – around the same proportion of people with natural red hair – are born with disorders of sexual development , but they are still either male or female. True hermaphroditism, when a baby has both oies and testes, is extremely rare.Our biological sex has a signicant impact on our health – even common diseases such as heart disease affect women and men dferently. It matters too when it comes to love. Homosexuality is same-sex attraction, it is not based on gender.And it is our biological sex that defines our le chances, whether we dare to be the President of the United States or are forced into sexual slavery.Of course, there are many men who dream of being more feminine, of adopting the gender stereotypes that women have spent much of their le escaping. There are teenage girls who are so scared of their lust for their female friends, that they become convinced they must be boys in disguise.And there are lots of people who simply enjoying playing with their sexual identity at dferent stages of their lives. We should respect each and every one of them.But that doesn’t mean allowing anyone to legally change their sex on a whim, or at , as the Scottish Government proposes in its reform of the Gender Recognition Act.Campaigners against the reforms, such as the LGB Alliance and For Women Scotland, believe they are “profoundly dangerous to women”.But the First Minister, a self-declared, committed feminist, insists there is no tension or conflict between women’s rights and trans rights.Sadly, like the debate over a second independence referendum, there appears to be no middle ground when it comes to the sex versus gender ide.And, it seems to me, not enough respect for the reality of women’s lives as we live them, and not as someone imagines they should be lived.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament bosses wrong to remove eu flag says snp msp","story":"A senior SNP minister has weighed in to an escalating row over the removal of the European flag from outside the Scottish Parliament at the end of January.Brexit secretary Mike Russell claimed it was the “wrong decision which needs to be changed”.His comments were made after Holyrood Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh wrote to all MSPs on Thursday to inform them of the decision taken by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body .The body, which makes decisions on the running of Holyrood and is made up of a representative from each political party, agreed the flag should be removed at pm on Friday, January .: Scottish Parliament to stop flying EU flagMr Russell said on Twitter: “The flag is not only a symbol of our solidarity with the # and all EU citizens in Scotland, it also represents our wish as a nation toto membership of a union we never voted to leave.”Posting a picture on social media of the EU flag flying alongside the Saltire outside the Parliament building, he said there was “strong support” among MSPs for it to remain after Brexit.Hitting out at the Parliament’s decision, he added: “There is strong opposition to this regressive and isolationist policy and every effort will be made to change it.”Tricia Marwick, Mr Macintosh’s predecessor as Presiding Officer, said MSPs could force the Parliament to change its decisionthey voted for the policy to be reversed.A spokesman for Mr Russell said later that Scotland’s clear vote to remain in the EU “needs to be properly demonstrated by Holyrood continuing to fly the EU flag”.He added: “Taking the flag down on Brexit day would send completely the wrong message. We believe all MSPs should be able to have their say on this issue and we are now looking at how this might be brought to a vote of the full Parliament.”The European flag, with its gold stars on a blue background, was designed to stand for the “ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe”.It was first developed by the Council of Europein the s and also adopted the EU some  years later.The UK Government recently underlined its committment to the CoE after Brexit was completed.Speaking last week, the UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, said: “As we leave the European Union, the country and the world should know that this nation stands for liberty, freedom and human rights. “One mark of our standing for those values will be our continued vigorous participation in the Council of Europe and our subscription to the convention on human rights.”In his letter to MSPs, Mr Macintosh said the SPCB had agreed that after Brexit, the Scottish Parliament “will no longer fly the EU flag on a daily basis”.He added Holyrood will still fly the Council of Europe flag on Europe Day “as a mark of our continued ties with that body”, adding the Parliament’s flag policy will now be “amended to reflect these decisions”.A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “The decision taken reflects the legal position that the UK will no longer be a member of the EU from  January.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"council to carry out churchyard safety check ","story":"Unsafe memorial sign.Surely a #This memorial has FAILED# # notice should be red  Bairns who may not be of reading age, but who know about traffic lights, and those who left their specs at home, will very likely think a green notice means the structure is sound.Unless they#re colour blind.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"man handed payback order and told to pay compensation ","story":"A man was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay £ in compensation after he admitted taking a backpack from a pub which did not belong to him.Richard Oswald Layfield, , of Horseshoe Close, Virkie, was in the Douglas Arms pub in December  when he took the pack, believing it to belong to a friend he was with at the time.But when he got outside he realised the bag, in fact, belonged to somebody .Instead of putting it back, however, he held onto it – and its contents, which included a £ i-phone, £ in cash and a set of car keys.Layfield admitted a charge of reset when he appeared in the dock before Sherf Ian Cruickshank yesterday.Procurator fiscal Duncan MacKenzie said it would have been simple for Layfield to have rectied his mistake.“It was not the case that he was in a drunken state.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff.

Established in January , the six week project has witnessed a record  participants sign up for this year’s programme. Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet!

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

BumpAlongtheWay premiered at the stGalway Film Fleadh last July, where it won the award for Best First Irish Feature, and had its international premiere at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival. Speaking at the Derry premiere last October Bronagh said it was very much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Its about a woman in her s who goes on a night out and gets pregnant, much to the disgust of her -year-old daughter.She thought she couldnt have anymore kids and she finds herself about to have another one. Its a bitter sweet comedy because its about serious subject matters that women have to deal with like fertility, menstruation, endometriosis and menopause.They are heavy subject matters that can impact peoples lives and cause a lot of unhappiness. But theres also humour and a lot of jokes about down below so I think we got the balance right anditsvery much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Bronagh says it was a pleasure to work with her sister Louise and shehopes to do so again in the future. Wevedone a couple of bits and piecestogether but this is the first major feature film together. Im so proud of her because she is so professional and she really, really cares for the people she is working with.Im also very proud that we made the film in Derry and I look forward to working with the next young generation of film makershere in the city because there is so much talent and the sky is the limit.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years. His success is all the more remarkable because he is a year younger than most other candidates.Andrew is studying A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Down High.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Sam McBride: Ignoring an elegant solution, petition of concern reform undermines Belfast Agreement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanStorm Brendan NI BLOG: Widespread disruption, roads closed, coastal flooding and power outagesWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as widespread frost and cooler temperatures expectedBelfast Celtic defend Jay Donnelly signingThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
