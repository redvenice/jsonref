In the US, the use of certain Huawei equipment is already banned on security grounds and the UK is now being pressured to take a similar approach       Earlier this year founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei (pictured with China´s President Xi Jinping), said the company had never been asked to share \u0027improper information\u0027 Huawei has been the subject of concern for some years because of allegations of close ties to the country\u0027s government.Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to \u0027support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\u0027.A deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, Robert Strayer, said on Monday that Huawei \u0027was not a trusted vendor\u0027 and any use of its technology in 5G networks was a risk.And his position was backed by a Conservative member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Bob Seely, who said: \u0027Huawei cannot, by definition, be a trusted vendor. It is required by law to co-operate with Chinese secret services. It is close to, if not part of, the Chinese state.\u0027China has achieved great things, and we need to respect it and develop good deep relations with it, but it also has a reputation for wholesale intellectual property theft and state hacking.

New research from the Anna Freud Centre shows excluded children are more likely to experience behavioural and attention difficulties, emotional problems, difficulties with peers and perceived stress.Stephen Taylor, the school’s founding head teacher, said: ‘Having parents there is key to making a change. It means that, when the child gets back into mainstream, this is a parent who is supportive of the school because they’ve realised some of the difficulties – rather than being a parent who maybe assumes that a school is picking on their child or has got it wrong.’         Kate is involved as part of her ongoing work with mental health charities. Pictured as she attends the 2017 Gala Dinner for The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families        Working parents can share the burden, come in for half days or send grandparents in their place. Parents have to attend a one-day learning programme every week to coach them in skills to deal with challenging behaviour. Part of the journey is bringing parents out of the ‘denial’ that their child has a problem, Mr Taylor said. ‘It’s challenging for the parents because they have to acknowledge there’s things that they could do differently,’ he said.However, he said the classes are ‘non-judgmental’, adding: ‘Even those parents with the most challenging young people in the most challenging situations, they want something better.’Mr Taylor said the centre focusses on conveying a ‘message of hope’ to families and helping them to become ‘engaged’ with their child’s schooling.Much of pupils’ time is spent learning the National Curriculum. However, they also attend therapy sessions with experts accompanied by their parents.Last year, the Duchess announced a new project to help mend ‘broken Britain’ through supporting families in difficulty.She has made early-years intervention one of the cornerstones of her public work after seeing how so many problems faced by adults she had met – mental health issues, addiction and social exclusion – stem from their childhood.The Duchess has set up a task force of experts to investigate the issue, with a view to announcing a series of findings and recommendations later this year."},{"url":null,"title":"Ice cream vans facing extinction UK councils ban polluting vehicles","story":"Share this articleIce cream vans banned from London streets in crackdown on pollution | London Evening Standard"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/29/22/12877156-0-image-m-15_1556572021333.jpg","title":"Facebook Secret Crush embarrassing version Tinder Twitter users say F8 Conference","story":"Share this article                            Many expressed how they merge of dating and online friendships was unwanted         The idea of Facebook Dating\u0027s Secret Crush feature was downright creepy for some people Facebook told DailyMail.com that users are able to block or report from inside Dating messages or from their Dating Profile if they don\u0027t want to interact any longer.A representative shared that messages are also limited to text only to prevent someone from sending inappropriate photos and links.  They said anything in Facebook Dating will not be used outside of the feature at all and it will not affect ads or what users see in News Feed algorithm. Only those 18 and over can use Facebook Dating.It was only available in Colombia, Thailand, Canada, Argentina, and Mexico until Tuesday when it expanded to 14 new countries: Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, and Suriname. The Facebook rep told DailyMail.com they are looking forward to rolling out in other countries and plan to launch in the US the by the end of the year.          Zuckerberg had said that he believed the future was private during the event this week         A tweeter pointed out that the announcement wasn\u0027t in line with Zuckerberg\u0027s vision of privacy         Facebook\u0027s Fidji Simo speaks during the F8 Facebook Developers conference  in San Jose       Facebook Wants to Connect You With Your \u0027Secret Crush\u0027 | WIRED"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman discovers biological father mothers fertility doctor","story":"Share this article \u0027It\u0027s really important to protect vulnerable people,\u0027 she told The Dallas Morning News. \u0027You spend a lot of time with those doctors.

Photograph:  Brian Lawless PA Wire Every time Sinn Féin says it will approach the forthcoming Northern talks with “positivity” or “hope”, its leaders soon add a qualification – there has to be a plan if they don’t work.It’s easy to see that the party isn’t very optimistic that the talks will reach agreement on the relaunching of the institutions. Of course, the only route that the party sees for a successful conclusion of the talks is one that delivers its requirements – an Irish language Act, the legalisation of same-sex marriage and the extension of abortion rights to the North – the trinity of demands that the party now refers to as the “equality agenda”.If the DUP won’t agree – and it won’t, as Sinn Féin knows, at least not immediately – then Sinn Féin wants the two governments to step in. Or, more accurately, it wants the British government to step in and legislate for its “equality agenda” at Westminster, over the heads of the DUP.In fairness to it, the party acknowledges the two obvious things about that request: firstly, it faces the obstacle of the DUP’s confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives and, secondly, looking to the British to govern Northern Ireland because its parties can’t isn’t very self-determination-y, is it?When pressed, senior party sources acknowledge that the Irish language Act is of a separate order to the same-sex marriage and abortion issues, which have really been adopted by the party only relatively recently.Sinn Féin’s current position on abortion, after all, is less than a year old. And for all the prominence given to the two social issues now, you could easily forget that they had nothing to do with the collapse of the institutions in 2017.Litmus testThe Irish language issue, though, is more important and is regarded by the party and much of its base as a litmus test for any new administration. The party wants, and feels it needs, “a win” on the issue, not just because it would be a signal to many of its supporters about parity of respect for Irishness in the North, but because it’s so hard for the DUP to swallow. In the North’s bitterly polarised politics, a win for you is a loss for me, and vice versa.Senior party figures have also signalled that they will not accept any agreement to reconstitute the assembly and the powersharing administration that runs the risk of collapsing again after a few months. This rather pointedly ignores the fact that it was Sinn Féin which brought down the powersharing institutions two years ago over the botched renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme (and that the DUP has a standing offer to relaunch them without pre-conditions) but it does underline the low expectations that the party has about these talks.There is a lingering suspicion around some quarters that the Taoiseach’s office and Number 10 Downing Street announced the talks without a clear plan for what would happen next. In fact, there has been extensive work done by officials behind the scenes preparing for these talks. That is no guarantee they will reach any satisfactory conclusion, though. Judging by the mood music, the chances for success hardly look overwhelming right now.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876732.1556658985!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar urges concessions from dup and sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan and Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald:  The party believes the British government should legislate at Westminster for abortion, same-sex marriage and an Irish language act for the North if the DUP refuses to agree. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has appealed to the Northern parties to compromise in order to revive the Stormont institutions, while Sinn Féin has warned that the Irish and British governments must have a “plan B” to legislate for the Irish language, same-sex marriage and abortion rights at Westminster in case the talks fail.Mr Varadkar urged Sinn Féin and the DUP to be “generous” and make concessions in the Northern talks to achieve a breakthrough that would enable the powersharing institutions be reconstituted, rather than focusing on what happens if they are not successful.“We’d like people to focus on making them a success and that really requires all the parties, but particularly the two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, making progress and being generous and even making a few concessions that would allow us to get the powersharing institutions up and running,” Mr Varadkar said.The Taoiseach was speaking after Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the two governments needed to have a “plan B” for what happens if the talks fail.‘Positivity’“We will go into these talks with hope and positivity,” Ms McDonald said. “We will also go in with our eyes wide open, because we have been to his place before. Whatever happens, we’re very clear that the current political stalemate cannot continue. It’s simply unacceptable at this stage.“So in the event that we cannot resolve the equality issues, that the DUP cannot join with us to hard-wire equality into the system of governance . . . in those circumstances then the two governments will have to intervene.”The party believes the British government should legislate at Westminster for abortion, same-sex marriage and an Irish language act for the North if the DUP refuses to agree.Talks aimed at restoring devolution are set to begin next Tuesday following Thursday’s local election vote in the North. Stormont collapsed in January 2017 when the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister.British prime minister Theresa May has told her cabinet the London and Dublin governments are engaged in “intensive preparations” with the Northern Ireland parties ahead of the start of a fresh round of talks next week.After the British cabinet meeting, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “The PM said that while momentum exists around the need to commence the talks process, we should not underestimate the challenges facing the Northern Ireland parties.“Intensive preparations are now taking place between the UK and Irish governments and with the Northern Ireland parties on the structure and substance of the talks.”However, Sinn Féin sources said they had not been given any details about the timing, schedule or agenda for the talks yet.Meanwhile, the former head of the body responsible for decommissioning paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland is concerned by the political vacuum left by the still-incomplete resolution to the decades-long Troubles.John de Chastelain, one of the international peace brokers whose work led to the 1998 Belfast Agreement, says that it was never a “hard and fast political solution” to all the problems facing Northern Ireland, but rather a “blueprint” showing what should happen, with a lot more work required to make it happen.“My great regret is that more than 20 years after the agreement was brought into effect, there are still those who are seeking to use violence to change what is achieved, particularly when a whole new generation of people who weren’t alive during the Troubles are now voting.”Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876624.1556651284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour reaffirms policy that identifies second referendum as an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Jeremy Corbyn: the SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”. Photograph:  Stefan RousseauReutersJeremy Corbyn has fought off an attempt to change Labour’s policy on Brexit by committing the party to a second referendum in all circumstances. The ruling national executive committee (NEC) agreed after a five-hour meeting on Tuesday to retain the current policy that identifies a second referendum as “an option” if Labour cannot force changes to Theresa May’s deal or trigger a general election.“Labour’s European elections manifesto was agreed at the NEC today and it will be published soon,” a party spokesman said. “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”Pro-Europeans led by deputy leader Tom Watson wanted the manifesto to commit Labour to putting any Brexit deal approved by MPs to a confirmatory referendum. After the meeting,some pro-European MPs claimed that the decision meant that a vote for Labour could still open the way for a second referendum.However, Gloria De Piero, a Midlands MP who insists that the outcome of the 2016 referendum must be respected, also welcomed the decision.“Labour’s manifesto for the European parliament will not contain a pledge to hold a second Brexit referendum.The party’s ruling national executive committee agreed that another nationwide poll should only be “an option” if it cannot force a general election.” The Scottish National Party (SNP), Change UK and the Liberal Democrats said the NEC’s decision showed that Labour was not committed to a second referendum. The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”.“Jeremy Corbyn today had an opportunity to help bring an EU referendum closer, but instead he has chosen to continue his complicity in the Tories’ plan to remove us from the EU.” Indicative votesMrs May wants talks with Labour over a common approach to Brexit to conclude by the middle of next week. If the two sides fail to agree a common approach, the government will schedule a series of indicative votes on options for Brexit, probably including a customs union and a second referendum.Two former Conservative ministers, Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, said on Tuesday that they would chair a new initiative to develop “alternative arrangements” for the Border to avoid the Northern Ireland backstop.\u0026nbspThe Alternative Arrangements Commission will seek to develop detailed proposals to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border with\u0026nbsp“comprehensive customs co-operation arrangements, facilitative arrangements and technologies” as set out in a document agreed between Britain and the EU in Strasbourg in March.The commission said it had engaged a technical panel of border and customs experts, practitioners and lawyers with detailed knowledge of trade, business and community relationships in Ireland, as well as EU, UK and international trade regulations.“Nine working groups have been created covering topics including the Border and the movement of people in the context of the Good Friday agreement, tax, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, small traders and trusted trader schemes,” the commission said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their

recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very

The third item that makes up the regalia, a mirror, is not permitted to leave Ise Shrine, in Mie Prefecture, the spiritual home of the Shinto religion.Chamberlains also presented the two seals of state to the emperor, who wore a formal suit with a red sash and a white bow tie. Skies cleared over Tokyo on Wednesday morning, although the heavy rain overnight had not stopped countless Japanese people celebrating the arrival of the new era on the stroke of midnight. Television footage has shown revellers dancing in the streets in the Shibuya district of Tokyo at midnight, many wearing T-shirts bearing the two characters for the name of the new era - which means “beautiful harmony”. Thousands more braved the rain to be outside the imperial palace at midnight, with one man who had travelled from Kyoto for the occasion telling Kyodo News, “I wanted to see this place to have a special memory because this is a once-in-a-lifetime event”.People celebrate as new Emperor Naruhito\u0026#39s era of Reiwa, or \u0026#34beautiful harmony\u0026#34 began early Wednesday, May 1In the city of Dazaifu, in south-west Japan, more than 1,500 local people were marshalled into the shape of the characters for Reiwa, with 68-year-old Hiroshi Nabeshima saying, “I feel lucky to be part of the celebration”. In Yamagata, five couples got married at a hotel at midnight, while hundreds of others registered their marriages at city halls within seconds of the start of the new era.Elsewhere, a fully-booked charter flight flew over Mount Fuji at dawn and local officials on Minamitorishima Island, Japan’s most easterly point, gathered on a beach to see the first sunrise of the Reiwa Era. Japanese Emperor Akihito leaves the Chrysanthemum Throne, in picturesThe new emperor and Empress Masako will make their first public appearance at the imperial palace on Saturday, greeting members of the public from a balcony. A number of further ceremonies are scheduled for the coming months, culminating in the Sokuirei Seiden no Gi, the formal enthronement of the emperor, on October 22. Local elections 2019: What time do the polls open tomorrow and when will we know the

cave boys get 70000 netflix tale survival","story":"Netflix and SK Global Entertainment have signed a deal to recreate the Thai cave rescue storyThe families of the 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave last year in an 18-day ordeal that captured the world’s attention are set for a financial windfall after streaming giant Netflix announced a joint venture to recreate their story. Netflix announced on Tuesday that it will team up with the production company for the blockbuster movie “Crazy Rich Asians” to tell the dramatic tale of how the boys and their football coach were rescued by ers from the flooded Tham Luang cavern in northern Thailand.  Thailand’s culture ministry first revealed plans to sign a Netflix deal in March, announcing it would be a miniseries and that the families of the young survivors would each be paid a sum of $94,000 (£72,000). The 13 Thumluang company, set up by Thailand\u0027s government to guard the interests of the boys and their coach, and which awarded the rights to Netflix and SK Global Entertainment, has also committed to donating 15 per cent of the project’s revenues to charity organisations that focus on disaster relief.The Wild Boars football team became trapped while exploring the vast cave complex last June when heavy rainfall flooded the exit. A short film clip of the astonishing moment they were found sheltering on rocky shelf by two British ers went viral around the world and led to a daring underwater extraction mission carried out by an international team of cave ers and the Thai navy SEALs. The Royal Thai Navy during the rescue operationWe are grateful for the opportunity to thank the people and organisations from Thailand and around the world who came together to perform a true miracle, by retelling our story, said Ekapol Chanthawong, the boy\u0027s coach, in a press release. We look forward to working with all involved parties to ensure our story is told accurately, so that the world can recognise, once again, the heroes that made the rescue operation a success,” he added. Jon M. Chu, the American filmmaker behind the global success of Crazy Rich Asians” and Nattawut Poonpiriya, a Thai filmmaker, will be directors on the project.Mr Chu tweeted last year that he would not allow Hollywood to “#whitewashout the Thai Cave rescue story! No way. Not on our watch. That won’t happen or we’ll give them hell.” An independent film called The Cave,” has already been shot by Irish-Thai director Tom Waller and is expected to be released later this year.Please review our commenting policyTurner Prize in gay rights row after choosing Stagecoach as sponsorJohn Worboys charged with four sexual offencesChristchurch police say bomb not linked to mosque attack\u0026#39Oliver Twist\u0026#39 school criticised for bread and butter lunches if parents fall behind on paymentsFrench police fire tear gas at protesters in Paris May Day demonstrationUS says military intervention \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 in Venezuela as Guaido calls for massive May Day protestBrexit latest news: Theresa May will have \u0026#39no option\u0026#39 but to agree to a customs union, says Labour Chris Grayling cancels no-deal Brexit ferry contracts at cost of £50m to taxpayers How Emperor Naruhito was shaped by his studies at Oxford and encounters with the British royal familyJewish Labour activists call on Jeremy Corbyn to quit after heChurch warden relished ‘project’ to kill pensioners and inherit their Maids Moreton houses, court hearsJulian Assange jailed for 50 weeks for going into hiding as judge reveals his asylum cost UK taxpayer £16mMeghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewLocal elections 2019: What time do the polls open tomorrow and when will we know the results?US police officer who shot dead Australian yoga teacher Justine Damond convicted of murderDefendant in critical condition after dousing himself with acid in the dockComment: The Cambridge inquiry into slavery is a dangerous threat to the robust reading of history A mirror, a sword and a gem: Inside the mystery-laden coronation of a new Japanese emperorWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us says military intervention possible venezuela guaido calls","story":"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a television interview on Wednesday that the United States was prepared to take military action to stem the ongoing turmoil in Venezuela.Military action is possible.

In a highly\u0026nbspcompetitive sector, it\u0027s\u0026nbspthe sort of thing that could drive them out of business. And the improvement certainly isn’t anything to shout about when put in the context of how important the service has become and the impact that the poor performance of broadband providers can have on iniduals and their businesses.\u0026nbspThe regulator has correctly recognised that action is necessary to correct their collective failure.\u0026nbspThe regular publication of the figures is a part of that, but it has also recently taken more concrete steps. \u0026nbspPerhaps its most important reform is the demand that firms automatically compensate customers when they suffer outages or are hit with delays. This also applies if engineers schedule appointments and don’t turn up. Customers are being given more and better information about the speeds they can expect when they sign up, and the power to walk away form contracts if they have a problem.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAll this means that firms that fail to shape up could find themselves facing a significant financial penalty. Bad news for TalkTalk in particular. It again found itself at the bottom of the service league table.Ofcom\u0026nbspalso wants to show its charges a carrot as well as a stick. It hopes that firms scoring more highly will be rewarded with more business.But do people look at Ofcom’s scores and factor them in when choosing a broadband provider? Is there enough differentiation between the firms at the top and those at the bottom to have a meaningful impact on the business they bring in?The figures would suggest otherwise and the industry’s fairly dismal reputation may\u0026nbspserve to put people off switching full stop. Who wants to risk going without broadband for several days, even with the\u0026nbsppromise of compensation if it happens?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The numbers really aren\u0027t as good as they look\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentSainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe pleased the City with first set of results after the collapse of his planned merger with AsdaSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe needed to pull a rabbit out of his hat after his attempt to merge the grocer with Asda was blown up by the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority.With his full year\u0026nbspnumbers, he has managed to find one. It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long.\u0026nbspThe numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss favoured profit over logic in the Asda mergerCMA slays Sainsbury\u0027s, Asda attempt to create supermarket Thanos Sainsbury\u0027s £12bn merger with Asda blocked by regulatorUnderlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the idend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs.\u0026nbspIt was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on.\u0026nbspBut all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five.\u0026nbspThen there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspso keen for people to focus their attention on. It excluded\u0026nbspfully £396m worth of supposedly “one off” items.\u0026nbspIn addition to the money the company blew on the deal, Sainsbury’s listed\u0026nbspcosts relating to guaranteed minimum pensions, retail restructuring, “Sainsbury’s Bank transition”, and the integration of Argos into the business.\u0026nbspAfter factoring them all in,\u0026nbspprofits\u0026nbspslumped by 41.6 per cent to just £239m. That’s a lot less fluffy than the underlying number Coupe was so keen to show off.\u0026nbspIt has risen for two years in a row but pre tax profits have been down for three.

Kantar’s authoritative retail survey has shown the group consistently losing market share. Sainsbury’s complains that it doesn’t include Argos and general merchandise in its numbers but the same is true for, say, Tesco, which has been doing a lot better when it comes to what Kantar does include.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to corporate results and the City decided it fancied these ones despite the issues I’ve raised. Coupe has bought himself some breathing space. It will, however, prove temporary if he can’t stop Sainsbury’s from wilting. Make no mistake, that’s what it has been doing while he’s been he’s been off trying to strike a mega deal. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mark Zuckerberg is expected to give more detail on the company\u0027s attempts to stress privacy and security, as part of a plan to deal with the fallout from its various data scandals.But it appears to have published those announcements earlier, presumably by accident, setting a page detailing them live. It has since been removed again, with the link only showing an error page.When it was up, the post revealed all of the updates that Facebook plans to bring to its messaging app, showing off both new features as well as the ones it intends to work on in the future.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

They include private chats that the company says it can\u0027t read, in addition to new ways of talking to friends.Facebook\u0027s redesign will help make it an easier way to find groups and other new features of the site, the company said.But it also brings an entirely new look, one of the most dramatic redesigns of how the homepage looks on computers since it was launched. Mark Zuckerberg noted that the app isn\u0027t even blue anymore, which is also true of the website.The Facebook icon has also been changed to make it more lively and modern, Mr Zuckerberg said.As well as the visual redesign, the new website and app\u0027s look also come with a variety of changes underneath, which should allow them to load more quickly and more efficiently.Facebook said the redesign and the focus on groups were part of its mission to become the public square of the internet. But it also acknowledged that it was part of a plan to rescue the company\u0027s reputation from the various problems it has faced in recent weeks.People have always come to Facebook to connect with friends and family, but over time it\u0027s become more than that – it’s also a place to connect with people who share your interests and passions, Facebook said in a release.\u0026nbspToday we’re making changes that put Groups at the center of Facebook and sharing new ways Facebook can help bring people together offline.The change will arrive straight away in the Facebook app, and the new desktop version will come in the next few months, Facebook said.Facebook now has tens of millions of active groups, and more than 400 million people belong to them, it said.Alongside the redesign, Facebook will add a host of new tools aimed at making it easier to be a part of groups.It has an improved discovery tool, that will feature better recommendations, to let people find groups they might be interested in more easily.It will also now be easier to share to those groups, Facebook said. Users will be able to share anything they find directly into groups from the news feed, just like happens now with sharing to friends and family.There will also be a host of new features specifically tailored to members of different kinds of groups. In Health Support groups, for instance, users will be able to ask questions or post information without having their name attached to it job groups will feature new templates to advertise for postings gaming groups will allow people to chat within the group itself and buy and sell groups will let people more easily ask questions and buy things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it could eventually roll out to all users, leaving them unable to see how many likes their posts get.People will still be able to see when someone likes their posts, and clicking through will show everyone who has done so. But the only way to find out how many of them there are would be manually counting up, since Instagram will no longer show the big number next to the post.“Later this week, we’re running a test in Canada that removes the total number of likes on photos and video views in Feed, Permalink pages and Profile,” an Instagram spokesperson told\u0026nbspTechCrunch, which first reported the news. “We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Many influencers and other people who are paid to post on Facebook use the like metric as an important way of understanding how popular and engaging a post is. Those numbers can then affect how much brands will pay them to post, making likes an important number for those users.Facebook quietly announces exposure of millions of Instagram passwordsInstagram said it was aware that hiding the likes could therefore be financially difficult for many Instagram users. It told Techcrunch it was thinking through ways for them to communicate value to their brand partners and that the idea was still in its exploratory stages.As anxiety about the damage social media is doing to people\u0027s mental health and wellbeing has spread, the idea of removing some of the more obvious and competitive markers of a person\u0027s popularity has spread. The idea has gathered support from people including Kanye West, who last year sent a flurry of posts about the damage that like counters were doing to social media users.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Operators say that\u0026nbspas a result, they need to make up that shortfall by charging customers instead.They say they also need to increase fees as consumers increasingly switch to contactless payments, meaning fewer people are using cash machines.But Link said there was no danger of free cashpoints disappearing.John Howells, the chief executive, said: “Free access to cash is vital for consumers and the UK enjoys extensive coverage that Link is committed to protecting.“There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK, 10,000 more than we had in 2009, and currently 12,700 pay-to-use cash machines, down from over 23,000 in 2009.“Less than 3 per cent of withdrawals at Link ATMs incur a fee.”A spokeswoman for Cardtronics said: “The decision on whether to introduce a fee is taken on a case-by-case basis and reflects the economic viability of the inidual machine. We only ever charge a fee when there is no other option apart from removing the machine altogether.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And because UC is an all-in-one benefit, with all your eggs in one basket, when things go wrong for claimants the financial fallout can be dire.”Ms Garnham said there were “practical, inexpensive” changes the DWP could make to “clear the fog”, such as improving the information it provides so that universal credit claimants are not “floundering in the dark about their award”.\u0026nbsp“Clear and accessible information on how decisions are made and your right to appeal is the bare minimum we should expect from a modern benefit,” she added.It comes as the a separate report from a parliamentary committee said the\u0026nbspDWP\u0026nbspmust “prove it is up to the job” before a single existing benefit claimant is moved onto universal credit by a process known as “managed migration”.The House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee said Amber Rudd\u0027s department should immediately set up “tests of operational readiness” based on recommendations from a number of experts and should ensure it can meet those tests before beginning pilots of the migration.Universal credit to see 1.9 million people ‘lose £1,000 per year’DWP kept ‘alarming’ universal credit findings secret for 18 monthsGovernment treating universal credit witnesses ‘like dirt’, say MPsCommittee chair Frank Field said: “Anyone who sees their income slashed or their circumstances and life chances reduced, or any of the other messes universal credit is getting people across this land into, will find no comfort in learning it didn\u0027t happen on purpose.”Does\u0026nbspDWP\u0026nbspwant to explain to them it didn\u0027t bother to find out how they might be affected? Will it be a comfort to learn\u0026nbspDWP\u0026nbspdid take a look at that, but didn\u0027t bother to apply its findings?\u0026nbspDWP\u0026nbspshould not move one person onto UC until it does test, and does learn, and proves it is ready to safely do so.“A DWP spokesperson said: “More than 1.8 million claimants receive a monthly statement advising them of their entitlement, how it has been calculated and what to do if they think the payment is incorrect.\u0026nbspHelp is also available from work coaches, the freephone Universal Credit helpline, gov.uk and through our ‘Help to Claim’ partnership with Citizens Advice.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government\u0027s freight capacity contracts for the summer period are no longer needed and have therefore been terminated.The government has taken this decision now as it represents the best value for money for taxpayers.The termination of these contracts has resulted in less cost to the taxpayer than the termination costs reported by the NAO in their own analysis of the freight capacity contracts.The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has expressed concern about a foreword written by Jeremy Corbyn to a century-old book which argued banks and newspapers were controlled by Jews.Marie van der Zyl called on the Labour leader to explain how he came to write his preface describing JA Hobson\u0027s Imperialism: A Study as a great tome, saying the book contained an obvious anti-Semitic message.In an open letter to Mr Corbyn, she said of the book: This is pure and unequivocal racism and there can be no apology for it.Ms van der Zyl said the disclosure followed the Labour leader\u0027s long record of sharing platforms with, and offering support to, groups which had made unambiguously racist comments and in some cases endorsed terrorism against Jews.The British public is entitled to know how you account for these actions and we expect a full explanation, she wrote.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable calls for a \u0027fresh approach\u0027 to climate change and urges the government to oppose the expansion of Heathrow.\u0026nbspMay says she is proud of the government\u0027s record.Labour\u0027s Liz McInnes\u0026nbspasks about smear tests, saying laboratories are overwhelmed due to a recent public awareness campaign.

Puts pressure on May to match it or spread the \u0027hostile environment\u0027.May says he is asking English students to pay for the commitment.Blackford says she is blinded by ideology and asks if the government will extend visas to allow\u0026nbspEU students to study in Scotland.May says its rich for the SNP to say she is blinded by ideology and tells them to stop obsessing about independence if they are worried about students.Corbyn says May has got\u0026nbspher \u0027head in the sand\u0027 and the social care system is in crisis.\u0026nbspHe pivots to\u0026nbspviolent crime\u0026nbspand asks her to accept there is a violent crime epidemic that needs to be addressed with more money.May says there should never be gaps in social care provision.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Salvini was tagged in the post.\u0026nbspThe viral image was widely shared after Italian activist Marco Furfaro posted it on Facebook alongside the caption: “Caltanissetta protesters. Love beats hate 3-0. Trolling Salvini to the extreme. You rock Gaia and Matilde.”The hashtag #GaiaeMatilde – the names of the two young women in the photo – has gained traction on Twitter.Gaia can be seen appearing to attempt to take another photo kissing her friend after taking the first one but a security agent appears to swiftly place their hand in the way in order to separate the two young women.“The hand of another friend that ides,” says the caption of an image which can be seen on her Instagram Stories.Mr Salvini has been mocked in the wake of the image – with an influx of memes\u0026nbsppoking fun at the expression on his face. Others have hailed the women’s “brave” and “glorious” protest.“When the minister urged those present to take the stage and take a selfie with him, we had this idea because he participated in World Congress of Families as a minister,” Gaia, who has only been identified by her first name, told Euronews.\u0026nbsp“We made a provocative instinctive gesture, not at all premeditated. On stage, Salvini did not expect us to take a picture like this. When we kissed, an agent I think, separated us sharply and Salvini then told us ‘I wish you luck’ so we took off thanking him ironically.”Campaigners argue women’s rights are being rolled back\u0026nbspunder Mr Salvini and\u0026nbsptraditional stereotypes about the role of women are also worsening.The political leader was fiercely criticised after neither he nor any Minister from the League chose to attend national celebrations which sees Italy mark\u0026nbspthe liberation from fascism on 25 April each year.Campaigners protest against \u0027medieval\u0027 anti-abortion summit in ItalyLast week, Italian media documented neo-fascist demonstrations, desecrations of memorials of participants of the Italian resistance against fascism, and drawings of swastikas across the country. Some 30 people held a banner reading “Honour to Benito Mussolini” while performing fascist salutes in Milan.A day later, a garland commemorating a partisan who fought fascism in WW2 was burned down in Milan. Other memorials were desecrated across the country.The League, which supports far right and anti-immigration policies, formed a government coalition with the Five Star Movement in June 2018, after it won about 17 per cent of the vote in a general election.

The Spanish parliament contains a constellation of smaller regionalist parties, including some who advocate independence for their regions from Spain. It was however Mr Sanchez’s inability to reach an accommodation with these forces earlier in the year that originally led to him calling a snap election.The largest regionalist party, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), which advocates Catalan independence, said earlier this week that it would not write Mr Sanchez a “blank cheque” to govern, but that it was willing to cooperate.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A military member throws a tear gas canister near the Generalisimo Francisco de Miranda Airbase La Carlota, in Caracas, Venezuela.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You begin to think, why is this happening to me ”Margaret is now campaigning for better rights for homeless people after she became the subject of online abuse - with trolls accusing her of using her children in order to get a home when she posted viral pictures of them sleeping on plastic chairs last year.Margaret didn’t help her case when she had to appear in court in October  for shoplting over  Euros worth of clothes from Penneys in Dublin. She avoided jail but was put on probation for a year, telling the Irish Sun: “The clothes were for the kids. I feel like I am being targeted. It is letting the Government off the hook.”In the show, we see Margaret speaking at a protest in the Irish capital about the desperation of homelessness. At one point, she is filmed receiving a phone call from the council about news of a possible house but, just a few weeks later, her hopes are dashed as the offer of housing fails to materialise – the council is unable to guarantee accommodation for a family as big as hers.Her devastation is apparent, but she remains hopeful and speaks on the show about dreaming of living in a house where her children can go out and play with children in the road, and I can put on their pot of dinner and wash their clothes in a washing machine – stupid little things that mean nothing but mean everything when you haven’t got it.The programme moves on to traveller Tony, the ex-husband of glamour model Danielle Mason –who is opening a tanning salon with his millionaire pal and neighbour, Colin.But Tony’s dreams of having a successful business are postponed when he receives a -month prison sentence for offences of driving without a licence, dangerous driving and failure to stop for the police.His ex Danielle describes his unpredictable nature, saying: He craves the family le but then he never calms down, he’s out of control - that’s why I can’t be with him.Tony’s his own worst enemy. He really tries to pull it together and do the right things by everyone but then he’s always got that other side to him which is really wild.”The programme also covers the funeral of  year-old Mikey Connors  – a legend in the traveller community who was killed in a car accident while racing his horse-trap. Organised by his devastated -year-old brother Simey, we witness the biggest traveller funeral ever that includes a parade of  white Rolls-Royces, thousands of mourners and horse-trap races that cause chaos on the roads of Ashtead in Surrey.As Paul Brown, the chief undertaker, says: “The amount of money that has been spent is immense.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One minister, Jeremy Wright, told yesterdayaposs Cabinet meeting the choices were like being in an acid bath while Michael Gove said an unpalatable” deal was better than a disastrous one. And Chief Whip Julian Smith reportedly warned: Itaposs a customs union or a second referendum, and we are not having a second referendum.

We are fleshing out the details to see how far the Government can move towards us and then we will be able to ascertain how far we are able to move towards them. There are certain issues that we think they will be prepared to move on and we might be prepared to support certain positions. There are certain areas which we havenapost seen any movement at all. We want to take a view on the whole package, the whole deal, to seethere has been any true movement. By next week, five weeks will have passed since Brexit was due to take place. And both main parties will have seen the results of tomorrow’s local elections in England, which are set to be overshadowed by the ongoing EU withdrawal crisis. If the talks break down, ministers are planning to give MPs another series of votes on Brexit options, though this time using a preferential system so that they are forced to agree on at least option.    Government insiders hope this would pit Mrs May’s own proposal into a run-off with the next favourite option - probably a softer Brexit - and focus the minds of Tory Brexiteer rebels to finally back her deal. Tory ministers are split over whether to move to Labouraposs position on Brexit - which includes a customs union with the EU, the most controversial area for compromise. Brexiteers led a failed bid to rush the Withdrawal Agreement Bill back to Parliament, pushing MPs into another Brexit vote within days. And Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the Government risks losing Tory supportit agrees a customs union. “If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don’t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain Labour MPs,” he said. But Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told the Cabinet the options are like being in an acid bath... because there are no good options, the Times reports.  Chief Whip Julian Smith told members of Cabinet it was “time to get real” over the options, after Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal was defeated three times, thereports.

Brexit was delayed last month until October , with EU chief Donald Tusk warning: Please do not waste this time.

Sir Stephen Sedley warns the “opaque” way the benefit is paid forces hard-up families to “guess and grope” at whether payments are correct. That feeds into poor claimants’ “stress and worry” and affects their children, the Court of Appeal judge from  to  says. He accuses the six-in-one benefit of a “systemic failure to meet basic standards”, adding: “None of this is compatible with the rule of law.” Sir Stephen’s damning statement is part of a charity report that warns the “opaque and inadequate” UC system is leaving families “in the dark”. The Child Poverty Action Group studied the decision to issue a single monthly UC payment, with only a “basic” breakdown of how it was worked out.    This “inadequate” information means many of the UK’s .million UC claimants don’t knowthere has been a mistake, CPAG said. Of , cases flagged to the charity’s Early Warning System, a fth involved an administrative error by the Department for Work and Pensions . In one case, a man with terminal cancer struggled by for several months with £ a month less than he was owed until an advisor spotted the error. In another case a grandmother only discovered she was being wrongly charged the Bedroom Tax after six months. In another, a working mum with two part-time jobs only found about errors costing her £ a month after she saw a welfare rights advisor. In a foreword to the report, Sir Stephen wrote: “There is something Orwellian about a system which is intended to alleviate hardship yet is administered in ways which generate and aggravate human misery.”  Sir Stephen said it is a “fundamental principle” that government decisions must be clearly explained and open to appeal. But “the DWP is repeatedly falling down on every element of these public law obligations in its administration of Universal Credit,” he wrote. He warned the “opaque” system makes it “hard to comprehend” how much of each month’s payment is for housing costs or childcare. In turn that makes the final amount dficult to challenge, leading to “disaster” where the DWP gets it wrong, he wrote. “People in need are left to guess at and grope for things which should be clear and tangible,” he wrote. According to the report, UC helpline staff were often unable to explain how a claimant’s award was worked out because it was processed automatically. CPAG called for more information to be put in claimants’ monthly statements, including a full breakdown of how each payment was calculated.  And it demanded the UC online account, through which people manage their claim, is redesigned to put all key decisions in one place. CPAG Chief Executive Alison Garnham said: “Transparency should be a the heart of a fair social security system. But our research shows Universal Credit claimants do not always understand the amounts they’re getting. “That is all the more worrying as the number of universal credit claims is set to double this year to million. “The scope for misunderstandings, omissions and errors is vast.” A DWP spokesperson said: “More than . million claimants receive a monthly statement advising them of their entitlement, how it has been calculated and what to dothey think the payment is incorrect. “Help is also available from work coaches, the freephone Universal Credit helpline, gov.uk and through our ‘Help to Claim’ partnership with Citizens Advice.”  Meanwhile MPs sound the alarm today over a trial that will move , existing benefit claimants over to Universal Credit. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee says the DWP must prove it is “up to the job” before beginning the pilot of so-called ‘managed migration’, which kicks off in Harrogate in July. After the trial, million existing benefit claimants will migrate to UC from a delayed start date of summer  up to December . But Committee chairman Frank Field warned even the pilot scheme must not start until further tests have been carried out to ensure it works. He said the DWP “is yet to prove it’s up to the job” of preventing “messes” that slash people’s income or cut their le chances.

Only this time itaposs from a nondescript room in Labouraposs Westminster HQ where  party officials have been thrashing out a Brexit policy. Labour chiefs today agreed what the party will say about a second referendum in the May  EU elections. Labour WILL back a second referendum - but onlyit canapost get a general election or changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal. It was subject to a huge row in the run-up to the decision, with Tom Watson, who wanted Labour to go further, walking out of a meeting. Now that itaposs over, everyone is trying to claim victory. So what has actually been agreed and what does it mean  Hereaposs a quick guide.  Labour has agreed its Brexit manesto pledge for the European Parliament elections on May . The carefully-formed wording was signed off by the partyaposs -member ruling National Executive Committeeat a gruelling five-hour meeting today.The manesto will say Labour backs the option of a second referendum on Brexit - but only in certain circumstances. These areLabour canapost get a general election or canapost get the necessary changes to Theresa May ’s Brexit deal.Otherwise, Labour is still pushing ahead with its own Brexit plan. And talks with the Tory government about a compromise Brexit plan are continuing. Why is there a party row Remain figures, including deputy leader Tom Watson, wanted to go much further - by demanding a public vote onanyBrexit deal that is agreed.Under their plan, any deal would have been put to a confirmatory referendum letting the public choose between that deal and Remain. Pro-EU Labour backers sent more than , e-mails to the NEC urging them to back a confirmatory vote on any deal. The Unison, GMB and Usdaw unions - who all have NEC reps - also demanded the manesto included the policy, as did key members of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. And more than  MPs and MEPs demanded it too. Who aposwonapos today  Allies of Jeremy Corbyn won a victory by ensuring the more nuanced wording went into the manesto. According to reports, Remain-backers on the NEC - led by the TSSA union - tried to pass an amendment that would have committed to a referendum onanyBrexit deal.But it was easily defeated, according to reports. The agreed plan means there will not be a public vote under all circumstances. Thataposs been branded a fudge by some Remainers and leaves much more wriggle room later on. However, it also acknowledges fears that becoming the aposreferendumapos or aposRemainapos party would alienate voters in Labouraposs northern heartlands. So why are Remain MPs claiming victory   Despite apparently losing the day, Remain MPs celebrated. Thataposs because they believe the necessary changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal wonapost be achieved - because talks with Labour have been grinding on for weeks. And that means in the end, Labour will be forced to back a public vote. A Remain-backing Labour MP told the Mirror: I can’t see how they will get the necessary changes. And in any case, the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs will not back a deal without a confirmatory vote attached. Simple as that. Numbers haven’t changed. Labour Remainer Ian Murray added: Given there wonapost be a general election and the Tories will agree customs union and single market, the manesto commits to a public vote. Theyaposre also relieved that the words public vote will appear in a Labour manesto - which, after all, is a big sht from the partyaposs stance a year ago. Labour Remainer Wes Streeting said the NEC had made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manesto. So... this means all things to all people   Yes. Compare the Remainersapos claims to Gloria De Piero, who represents a Leave seat. She said the manesto will not contain a pledge to hold a second referendum.Or Labouraposs many hard Remain enemies, like Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP leader said: Labour is a Brexit supporting party.Even second referendum campaigns Best For Britain and People’s Vote couldnapost agree whether Labour’s policy was a good thing. Best For Britain’s Naomi Smith said Labour has “come a long way” and is keeping second referendum as an option. But Labour MP Bridget Phillipson of People’s Vote said Labour has done the “bare minimum” with a “mealy-mouthed” manesto pledge. “Labour risks demoralising activists, depressing turnout among supporters and decreasing the share of the vote for candidates who - like the overwhelming majority of our party - are fighting for a People’s Vote on any Brexit deal,” she said. How does this relate to the conference policy   This all unfolded the way it did because of another careful bit of wording - agreed six months ago at Labouraposs party conference in Liverpool. Back then, Labour agreed:If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the Government is confident in negotiation a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.Youaposll notice todayaposs wording is a bit dferent, because it makes specic reference to getting necessary changes to the governmentaposs deal. So itaposs very much in the spirit of the conference policy, but moves it on and makes it a bit more specic. What does it mean for the EU elections  Labouraposs enemies on both sides will try and paint todayaposs decision in the worst possible light. Remain parties will say Labour is backing Brexit and Brexit parties will say the party is moving towards a second referendum. Both will have the benefit of being, at least partly, true. Today’s decision leaves the possibility that Labour MEP candidates could break ranks from the official aposparty lineapos in the EU election campiagn. By this morning  of Labouraposs  MEP candidates had signed a pledge to campaign for a referendum, then back efforts to remain in the EU.

The Prime Minister has been nicknamed the “Maybot” amid claims she dodges questions and instead repeats responses from a set, pre-programmed menu.  Now, researchers have evidence she is less open than other Conservative PMs.  University of York academics have been studying the way she deals with TV and radio interviews, comparing her performance with answers offered by David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.  They found that during two interviews after she became PM in  and four during the  general election campaign, Mrs May answered just % of questions put to her.  In contrast, Mr Cameron answered % of questions in the  general election run-in, while both Mr Major - now Sir John - in the  election and Margaret Thatcher in  answered % of questions they were asked.   Mrs May proved even more evasive at Prime Minister’s Questions, according to the research led by Professor Peter Bull of the university’s department of psychology.   During  sessions of PMQs in -, she was said to have answered only % of the questions from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn . The previous year, however, Mr Cameron answered % of Mr Corbyn’s questions over the course of  sessions.  Prof Bull, who presents his findings to the British Psychological Society’s annual conference in Harrogate, accused Mrs May of honing a series of “covert” tactics for dodging questions.  “Of particular interest are her distinctive techniques of ignoring awkward questions, without even acknowledging that a question has been asked, which accounts for % of her evasive responses,” he said.  “She also responds to her own modied versions of questions, not to the version that was originally posed - % of her evasive responses are of this kind.” Prof Bull warned the dodging could undermine trust and may have fuelled the ongoing Brexit crisis.  “If Theresa May fails to answer questions, or even to acknowledge that she is not answering questions, to what extent can she be believed ” he said. “The consequent decline in her political credibility and authority has arguably played an important ongoing role in the current Brexit crisis.”  Mrs May’s spokesman hit back saying: “The Prime Minister has spent very signicant amounts of time in the House of Commons, not just at Prime Minister’s Questions but throughout the Brexit process, answering the questions of MPs.”  The Tory leader is expected to make her first public comments for three weeks today when she appears in the Commons for Prime Minister’s Questions.    She missed last week’s showdown - scheduled to be the first after the Easter break - so she could attend the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee in Belfast.  Askedthe PM had been “hiding”, her spokesman pointed out going to the reporter’s funeral in Northern Ireland was “the right thing to do”.  He said she had “been out campaigning on a number of occasions in recent days”, adding: “She will be in the House of Commons tomorrow and then she will taking questions from the Liaison Committee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"russian donor paid 135000 dinner","story":"NewsRussian donor paid £, to have dinner with Theresa May and cabinet membersLubov Chernukhin - whose husband was formerly an ally of Russias Vladimir Putin - paid for a meal with Theresa May and other top Tories on MondayShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTheresa May and several other top Tories went for dinner with the Russian banker \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe we of a former Russian minister dined with Theresa May and six female cabinet members on Monday night after winning an auction at a Tory fundraiser.

But the deliveries led to leaders of Marshchapel troop in Lincolnshire quitting, after they breached scout rules - which state the organisation and its members are non-political. The youngsters have received an apology over the affair. The leaflets were to promote Conservative candidates Paul Rickett and Daniel McNally. The pair are campaigning for the East Lindsey District Council elections this Thursday.    A spokesman for the Scout Movement said: We can confirm that a complaint was made to Lincolnshire Scouts about the st Marshchapel Scout Group delivering information for a candidates in the upcoming local election. Following receipt of this complaint the local volunteer manager spoke with the Group Scout Leader of the Scout Group concerned and it was clear this was a genuine error on behalf of the Group and one they have apologised for. In accordance with Scouting’s rules the matter was reported to the Charity Commission by the local volunteer manager. “Subsequently the Group Scout Leader of the st Marshchapel Scout Group submitted his resignation after taking full responsibility for the incident. “Other volunteers have also since resigned.

Delivering leaflets for a political party breaks our rules.   Scout leader, Matt Whall has posted a message on the village Facebook page apologising for the error.He said: I have stepped away from involvement with Marshchapel Scouts.Sadly, this is as a result of recent events in our community. “As you may be aware the Scouts recently distributed leaflets around the area. This was done in exchange for one year rent on an allotment space for the Scouts to grow veggies and learn about all things green, and not for financial gain for the group. “We hoped to run a soup kitchen for the community using veg grown in the village. The leaflets happened to be for a candidate in the local elections.    He added: ...The Scouts were  % safe at all times during this activity. I did not ask the Scouts to distribute leaflets for political gain or promotion but did something purely with the motive to provide an enriching opportunity for the Young People in the Group. It was an error on my part. As a consequence of this, coupled with a total lack of support for our Leaders from The Scout Association itself and their approach in dealing with the complaint, all the other Leaders have independently decided that they no longer wish to continue in their roles.” The councillors were approached for comment.

The neighbours, a family of six, had the extension done before moving in a year ago according to Neal, who said he has no relationship with them. Iaposm disgusted by the way this has been handled, Neal, who works as a driver,said. The neighbouraposs extension is actually touching the guttering of our house. I can reach out and touch it. He added: Itaposs definitely knocked value off the property.    The estate agents valued the house at £, but weaposve only had one offer of £, since then. Ten people have also not turned up when viewings have been arranged and people have actually driven past our home, seen the extension, and decided not to view it. We want to move out of the area but we canapost. Neal lives in the property with we Denise, , son Scott, , and daughter, Emma, .    The family first raised concerns about the extension when building work began in December . Neal insists the planning application should never have been approved. He said: I feel asmy concerns have been disregarded from the start. Council planning manager Gavin Prescott said Nealaposs complaint has been investigated but insists there was no fault in the councilaposs decision making process.  He said: Mr Robinsonaposs complaint has been fully and thoroughly investigated by both the council and the local government ombudsman. The councilaposs investigation concluded that full consideration had been given to the planning application and all relevant legislation. The ombudsman report also concluded that there was no fault in the councilaposs decision making process.

Sophie Hines, , Googled celebrities with large height dferences before she started dating Miles Lloyd, , to be reassured that they wouldnapost look ridiculous together. What is now a happy relationship could have actually started ten years previously when the then strangers posed together in a club because of their height dference, a recently emerged photo showed. One of the most common questions they get asked is how they have sex - a topic also on Sophieaposs mind when they first got together.    Despite the fact they have been mistaken for a dad and daughter, the lovebirds are happy with the ft in between them. Some online commentators are less content with the height dference however. Sophie has had angry taller girls rant at her online and say she should leave the tall boys alone and pick on someone her own size. Sophie and Miles, who share six-month-old son Remy Lloyd, admit it is a struggle when posing for selfies together and Miles often ends up with his head chopped out. Sophie, from Westclf-on-Sea, Essex, said: Our height dference hasnapost affected our relationship at all. I wouldnapost have him any other way.    I always say to him, aposdo you wish I was taller apos but he always says, aposno, I love it that youaposre smallapos. Iaposve never met any other couple with the same height dference as us. When we go out we get so many looks. It was weird at first but weaposve definitely embraced it now. Miles is so oblivious to it. When we first got together it was when Kourtney Kardashian was going out with Younes Bendjima and they had a massive height dference too.I was Googling pictures of Kourtney with her boyfriend and was worrying we would look ridiculous, so I had to Google to make sure I wasnapost the only one.I think people notice his height more because Iaposm so short. If I was  or something, I donapost think they would really notice it as much. But thereaposs such a contrast between us it makes it more noticeable.    Miles, who sometimes feels like a normal man in a tall manaposs body, enjoys the size contrast between their collection of size  and size  trainers. Miles, also from Westclf-on-Sea, Essex, said: I like our height dference. I love being out with her and showing off. We look very good together. We never spoke about the height dference when we started going out. I like that sheaposs small, I just like her. Itaposs amazing though. I canapost believe there are so many people interested in us. We just embrace it. I feel like Iaposm a normal man stuck in a tall manaposs body. I donapost even feel like Iaposm that tall - itaposs really surprising when people say it. I must get comments five or six times a day. I always ask them how tall they think I am because they always get it right first time anyway, so itaposs pointless, they didnapost need to ask.    The couple, who both work as underworkers in the same bank, had always noticed each other at the office but never spoke until Sophie joined Milesapos team. Sophie said: Iaposve known him since I was  - not to talk to, but Iaposve always seen him around. I saw him out loads of times and we worked in the same place for five years. Iaposve always known him as aposMiles the tall boyapos. We had never had a conversation but had seen each other around before we started going out. I remember just thinking how tall he was. We got a picture in a nightclub together, randomly, from when we were about . I think I just got the picture with him because he was so tall.    Itaposs so weird, and we look so dferent in the picture - and then  years later we have a baby together. Itaposs so strange. I donapost remember it. The dad-of-one claims he had always been shorter than his friends as a teenager, but suddenly shot up by six inches when he turned . Miles said: Thataposs the thing - all my friends were taller than me at one point. It was only when I turned  that I shot up. Iaposve not always been this big. I probably went from about  to about  or  in a year - I grew about six inches in a short space of time. My dad is  and my mum is  which is quite tall for a woman. Now weaposve got a little boy called Remy, and heaposs got massive hands and feet.    The couple claim they get a lot of questions about the logistics of their relationship and are even quizzed on their sex le. Sophie said it all works for us. Sophie, who is a mum-of-two, said: Loads of people ask us how we kiss. He has to crouch and I go on tiptoes - there is no other way. We get so many comments about how we have sex. I actually said that to him before we get together - how do you do it  But he said itaposs only his legs that are long - his body is a normal size. It all works for us, anyway. I just canapost believe that thataposs the first thing that people think of. I find it hard to frame a picture with both of us in. I normally just take selfies and things in the car because I know I can fit both of us in. Weaposve got a fullmirror in our house and Iaposve got loads where his head is just completely cut off. Itaposs him neck down, and thataposs it.    But despite being very happy together, Sophie claims she does get challenged by taller girls and has received negative comments online. Sophie said: A lot of angry tall girls have said I should leave the tall boys alone. There are a lot of angry tall girls who say, aposmy boyfriend is smaller than me, why have you taken a tall oneapos. But I canapost help it, can I  Itaposs such a silly comment. You canapost help who you like. Iaposm not going to dismiss someone because theyaposre tall and just go out with someone who is . I % confront people when they make comments about him - I have to do it. Miles definitely gets bored of [being asked about his height]. I want to get him a little card made up so that when people come up to him he can give them a little card that says, aposIaposm , no I donapost play basketballapos. He just has to say the same things over and over again.

She spent more than  minutes chatting to donors, supporters, architects and staff from the charity. Speaking about the building the duchess told one group: It must be so wonderful for you to see it. The organisation brings together experts and leading practitioners in neuroscience, mental health, social care, child development, research and education - working alongside children, young people and their families.     The centre will also provide training for professionals and postgraduate teaching.

As a society, we have a moral imperative to drive change on children’s mental health. “Opening our new building is our contribution to this – giving parents, communities and practitioners the skills, knowledge and support to help children build their health and wellbeing, and the confidence to seek professional help when needed.

Jay Barham and orce  mum-of-two Linda fell in love in  - despite their  year age gap. While many of their friends and family told them it would never last, the happy couple, from Harwich, Essex, have now enjoyed  years together. Now Jay, , and Linda, , have said the secret to their happy le is to never go to bed on an argument and spend lots of time together. Jay said: Linda has been called a child snatcher, Iaposve been called a granny basher. Weaposve been called names in the street, and sometimes people think she is my mum. But we donapost care what people say.    Our marriage has lasted a lot longer than many others and we are still very much in love. Jay was a trainee youth worker when he first met council youth worker Linda. The couple say they were instantly attracted and bonded during driving lessons she gave him and through their love of music. Jay added: For eight weeks she was helping me learn how to drive. And then one time a track just started playing and we just kissed. For the le of me I canapost remember which one but it had to be Elton John because heaposs our favourite. It was completely unspoken up until that point, but as it happened it was like the sun just came out and it was a shock to both of us. It took Jay, who had had three previous serious girlfriends before Linda, three days to get over the shock of the kiss before asking her out on a date.    At the time Linda, from Hardcourt, Essex, was concerned for the feelings she felt for a boy the same age as her son Simon. She said: I just thought: aposthis is wrongapos, I felt awful. But I was orced for five years, my children were all grown up and knew that it just felt right Lindaaposs children Alan, , and Simon, , were shell shocked at the idea of the relationship but decided that as long as mum happy, nothing  matters. For Jayaposs parents, who were over a decade younger than his new girlfriend, they thought it was just a flash in the pan. Jay said: They were okay about it, they just thought: aposOh well it will lastit lasts.apos We were more worried about how my nan would react, but she was fantastic about it. In spite of doubtful friends that were certain the relationship would never workout, Jay and Linda got married eight months after meeting in July . Jay said: We got married at Colchester Registry office on Friday the th, and everyone told us that we shouldnapost as it was an unlucky day.    And then my suit didnapost fit, our car broke down, the ring didnapost fit and it got to the point that Iaposd just wear trackies and a top Linda said: We were happy to get a bus to the wedding, but our family stepped in and sorted us out Jay and Linda have worked together for most of their married lives at an Asda bakery and are now opening a small cafe together near their home in Hardcourt, Essex. Jayaposs mother Valerie, who died in , was  years younger than Linda but the two were still extremely close. He said: Linda and my mum gelled really well, there were absolutely no problems. My dad has a really good relationship with Linda, he actually describes her as aposthe daughter he never hadapos. We all go on holiday together and weaposre incredibly close. In fact, bemused onlookers always mistake that Jayaposs dad Stephen and Linda as his parents.    Of course people always think Iaposm their child and theyaposre my parents, but we just laugh at it. Itaposs understandable, all sorts of people ask all sorts of questions. But Iaposve never thought about age, I just think about the woman I love. Jay and Linda are un-bothered by peopleaposs comments about their extreme age gap. Jay said People have said horrible things to us in the street. The couple have even had their car windows smashed in what they assume to be an attack on their marriage. Jay said: We just got on with it, even now people frown on it. I always reply to people like that asking how many orces theyaposve had. Most marriages have all split up, regardless of their age. Linda thinks there is some hypocrisy in judging older woman more so than older men that have young partners.    If itaposs a man then youaposre doing well for yourself, but thenyou are a woman then youaposre disgusting and frowned upon. We just love each other, we havenapost done this for fame or for money, we just love and think about each other. When the couple first got married, Linda was still able to have children but Jay was never keen in being a parent. I never wanted to be a father, Iaposm one of those people that just keep the toys to myself. Iaposm just not the parent type, I much prefer having grandchildren as you get to give them back. Linda has seven grandchildren between the ages of four weeks and  years-old. Jay says that he never thinks about the likelihood Linda will die before him: I treat everyday as my last so thereaposs no point in worrying about numbers. Personally the biggest positive about being married to an older woman is the civility, being able to speak about feelings and not pushing them under.    We have adapted our lives [for Lindaaposs age] for example instead of walking ten miles weaposll go for a ride in the car. Although they have adapted their lives in some aspects, they certainly havenapost changed anything in the bedroom. Jay wasnapost a virgin when he starting Linda and he described himself as well experienced. You donapost just stop having sex when you reach . She still has that drive, I donapost know why people think you die sexually at . The secret to a happy marriage, according to Jay, is simply about loving one another. I think itaposs spending so much time together, we love each other and we do everything together. The only think we argue about is the cat, and even then we never go to bed without sorting everything out.

Due to the aggressive nature of her disease, Esme simply does not have that long so they need to raise £, for a private transplant in weeks.    Esmeaposs dad said: “Having been told that a second transplant would be the fallback option for a failed first cord transplant, we have now learnt that the Marsden, to whom we have inexpressible gratitude for their expertise and care, are sadly blocked from supporting a second transplant until  months from the first due to NHS England policy. “Whilst we understand this policy from our extensive conversations with AML experts in the US, we know that for Esme the best course of action is try to get to a second transplant as soon as possible, rather than bide our time for seven months with maintenance chemotherapy to try and keep the disease at bay. “In the US and other private centres, second transplants are offered within one year but unfortunately that is not the case here in the UK. For her second transplant the plan would be to use an adultdonor and manipulate more aposgraft versus host effectapos to eradicate the leukaemia - so there is every hope for a permanent cure.

Siobhan OaposKeeffe, , suffered the injury eight miles into the  mile race then continued for more than four hours with her fibula bone snapped in half. She fought back the tears and battled on through excruciating pain to finish in just over six hours. But that was after the plucky runner had to stop after eight miles to get her ankle bandaged up by first aiders.     It started hurting after about four miles but it just got worse and worse, said Siobhan, from Surrey. I had to stop after eight miles. It felt bruised and really heavy, I thought it was sprained. I didnapost think itaposd be possible to run on a broken ankle. The pain was unbearable but all I wanted to do was finish. I had tears in my eyes. The adrenaline just kicked in. Siobhan was forced to stop after eight miles when she came across St Johnaposs Ambulance medics. She says the lower part of her leg was swollen and red, and was advised to stop running by first aiders.  But determined Siobhan, who was running in aid of the Children With Cancer charity, says dropping out of the race was never an option. She has raised £, for the charity with her work colleague, Sarah Hopkins, , and with her ankle now wrapped in bandages, picked herself up and started running again. Siobhan, who initially wanted to complete the marathon in around five hours, said: The St. Johnaposs Ambulance people said aposmaybe you should stop nowapos. But I needed to get to the end. All of my family were there and I was running for charity. I didnapost want to let anyone down. The pain was really bad. I had to walk a bit but did carry on running. I ended up running with the pacer.  I was in a group of people and that really helped me along. I knew I wasnapost going to get the time I wanted so I just ended up wanting to finish at all. I was gutted. I think Iaposd be able to hit my target. Siobhan had spent four months training to run the marathon on Sunday. She had nailed her race preparation and was buzzing with excitement on the start line of one of the worldaposs most famous races. But Siobhanaposs once-in-a-le-time marathon experience has been overshadowed, she says. Running was just agony. I canapost explain how much it hurt. I joked with another runner thatfelt as though I was running on a broken ankle.    I feel like I have unfinished business with the marathon. I did say never again when I finished but Iaposll never say never. Siobhan says the pain never went away and was only temporarily numbed by the roar of the crowds as she ran down The Mall towards the finish line. But even after picking up her finisheraposs medal - Siobhan says she didnapost go to AE until the next morning. Siobhan went home to celebrate with her family and even went to sleep with her ankle still broken - before waking up at am in agony. She went along to AE at West Middlesex Hospital in the early hours of Monday morning.    She was taken for an X-ray which revealed her fibula bone has snapped near her ankle joint - leaving doctors baffled at how she managed to complete the race. Siobhan said: The orthopedic surgeon said he had no idea how I ran with it. He said it was a trauma break. He couldnapost believe it. Everyone at hospital said Iaposm amazing for what I did. No one can believe it. Siobhanaposs ankle is now encased in a cast and will find out on Fridayshe needs an operation. If not, she will need to wear the cast for up to six weeks but her recovery may go on for longersurgery is required.

Built on the site of the old Waldorf Astoria hotel on fth avenue, the art deco style building is one of New Yorkaposs most recognisable landmarks. It is also a movie star, wedding venue, and office building which attracts millions of visitors from around the globe each year. Here are  secrets of the tower which have helped make it world famous.  . Race to be the biggest New York’s economy was booming in the late s and builders all wanted to have the kudos of creating the world’s tallest building. The main competition was between  Wall Street’s Bank of Manhattan and the Chrysler building. But the race hotted up when plans for the ,ft tall Empire State Building were announced.Chrysler added a fixed stainless steel spire to the top of his skyscraper to make it ft.But then the designers of the Empire State went back to the drawing board and added more floors.When it was eventually completed in  it was ft tall and remained the world’s tallest building for  years until he completion of the first World Trade Centre tower.  . Itaposs original design plan The owners of the Empire State Building were convinced that transatlantic airships travel was the future. So the building was fitted with a mast as a docking port for airships.The plan was the aircraft could dock alongside the building and passengers could exit via an open-air gangplank.But high winds at the side of the building meant it was virtually impossible for pilots to navigate. The closest thing to a “landing” came in September , when a small dirigible tethered itself to the spire for a few minutes so the airship plan was abandoned.  . Home to daredevils In April , British thrill seekers Alastair Boyd and Michael McCarthy hid parachutes under their coats, bought tickets to the Empire State Building and then hurled themselves off its th floor observation deck. The pair landed safely more than , feet below on rd Street, but were both charged with “reckless endangerment” and “unlawful parachuting.” Twelve years later, Norwegian parachutist Thor Alex “The Human Fly” Kappfjell repeated the stunt by jumping off the building’s th street side.Kappfjell managed to escape and parachute off the Chrysler Building a few days later, but he was eventually arrested after jumping off the World Trade Center.    . Struck by tragedyIt took , workers one year and  days to build the Empire State Building, and sadly five construction workers lost their lives on the mammoth project.The deaths were hardly surprising when you look at the images of workers on the site without safety harnesses or hard hats.Including the land, the skyscraper cost £m to build.  . Film history The tower has provided a dramatic backdrop for many famous films including Elf, Sleepless in Seattle, The Amazing Spiderman and An Affair to Remember. Perhaps its most famous role was in the  movie King Kong  where the giant gorilla scales the side of the building with his hostage Ann.    . Love is in the air Every year the building runs a competition for couples to win the chance to get married on one of the famous observatories on Valentine’s Day with the stunning Manhattan skyline behind them.Usually the winning couples have a romantic story which involves the building such as first saying “I love you” at the top of the tower.    . Race to the top Every year the Empire State Building Run Up challenges athletes from across the world to race up its  flights of stairs. You can get to the observatory in the lt in under a minute, but the fastest runners can make it to the top in about  minutes.This year’s race takes place on May . . Bolt from the blue It has a lightning rod at the top which is struck by lightening round  times a year.The lightning rod provides a low-resistance path to the ground which carries the enormous volts of electricity away from the building to protect it and any people from damage or injury.  . Daily grind Only the Pentagon is bigger. The Empire State building has ,,  square feet of floor space,  elevators and , windows. It is home to so many businesses that it has its own zipped .    . Star power More than  million people have visited the Empire State Building’s famous observatory since the building opened in .Famous visitors have included the Queen, Fidel Castro, the rock band KISS, Ronald McDonald, Lassie, and Tom Cruise.

Itaposs an unbelievably high figure, but itaposs an easy mistake to make. The size of our boobs can change for a number of reasons, includingwe lose or gain any weight, but lots of us of guilty of getting measured and sticking to that size for years. So how do you knowyouaposre wearing the right bra  And how often should you buy a new one  Marks and Spenceraposs bra fit expert and technical manager Julia Mercer has spoken to theto answer these important questions.  How do I knowIaposm wearing the right bra  There are a few tell-tale signs that youaposre not wearing the right size bra. Under-boob This is when it looks like your boob is coming out under the cup. Itaposs caused when the underband is too big and the cup is too small. Julia says: A good fitting underband should fit firmly but not too tight. The best way to check that a bra is fitting correctly is to lt the arms up and twist the body, the bra shouldnapost move and stay in place at all times. Side-boob This is when the boobs spill out of the side. Itaposs caused by the cup being too small. It can be very painful. To check the cup fits correctly, make sure it is fully encasing ALL the breast tissue. Tight straps  You should adjust your straps so you can just fit two fingers on top of each other underneath. A good way to checkyour bra is giving you enough support is to slide the straps off and seethe cups are still supportive. The straps are designed to hold the cups up, not to give support. Julia says: Some larger breasted ladies may suffer with sore red marks on their shoulders where the straps have been over adjusted with the intention of gaining extra support. If straps are shortened too much the breast will fall forward and the back of the bra will work its way up, therefore not giving support at all. The four-boob effect This is when the incorrect cup size pushes the tissue up. It can look very unflattering when youaposre wearing clothes. Julia says: This is a common problem we see regularly. Itaposs very common with women who have put on weight as the breast is made up of % fat. Some women donapost want to go up a cup size and continue to wear the wrong size which can make outwear look unflattering. Did you know thatyou wear the correct cup size you can actually look smaller  Back fat According to Julia: Unfortunately every woman, no matter their size, has this issue and can be made worsethe underband of the bra is too tight.  A good tip is to wear a shaped back bra as this smoothes any lumps and bumps. Cups are too big If youaposve lost weight recently, there is a good chance you cups will be too big. This means they wonapost support the breast tissue properly, and it can also make your bra look unflattering. The cup and the underband should fit snugly. How are bras measured  Bras are fitted by taking two measurements, and it only takes a few minutes.  You can wear your old bra while these measurements are being taken. The band size is the size of your rib cage, and is taken by measuring just below the strap of your existing bra. Itaposs recorded in even numbers, e.g. , , , . The second measurement is the bust. The person doing your fitting will when work out the dference between the rib cage and the bust size and work out your cup size. This will be a letter, e.g. A, B, C, D, DD. How long do bras last  If weaposre being honest, most of us have bras in the drawer which have seen better days.  Theyaposre not quite white any more and theyaposre definitely no longer sexy - but theyaposre just so comfy. But it looks like we should be replacing them more often than we thought. Julia says: In my opinion, a bra is at its best in its first year of being worn. How often should I wash my bra  This is something that causes of a lot of debate between women. Some will wash their bra every time they wear it, as they would with knickers, while others will wear it a number of times before popping in the laundry basket. Julia says: I would recommend washing after each use as this keeps your bra clean and fresh. What can I do with my old bras  Of course you can just pop them in the bin, but lot of shops offer a great recycling service. How do I pick the right sports bra  When it comes to buying a sports bra, lots of women find themselves a bit lost. Luckily, Julia has a few tips for finding the right one for your shape. She says: A good fitting sports bra can reduce the amount of bounce and provide extra confidence, in turn helping you make the most out of your workout.  Having the right support for your breasts during exercise is so important and provides the foundation for a great work out. Your breasts move in a figure of eight motion when youaposre running and can move up to cm in any direction during exercise so finding an impact level that bests suits your activity is key.

Largely regarded by the scientic community as a myth, the Yeti is part of Nepali folklore and is said to live high in the snow-capped Himalayas. In a tweet accompanied by pictures, the Indian army said it had sighted footprints measuring  by  inchesclose to a camp near Mount Makalu, Nepal, on April . For the first time, an Indian Army Mountaineering Expedition Team has sited Mysterious Footprints of mythical beast aposYetiapos it said in a tweet.  Located on the border between Nepal and China, Makalu is the fth-highest mountain in the world. It stands near the Makalu-Barun valley, a remote wilderness that has also been surveyed by researchers hunting for the Yeti. Daniel C. Taylor, who has extensively explored the Makalu-Barun area and written a book on the mystery of the Yeti, said the footprints were likely those of bears.  If that is the footprint of an animal or a single animal, itaposs the size of a dinosaur, he said. He added that repeated measurements of the footprints were required to ascertain their origin. One needs to really confirm those measurements of the footprint size because we know for sure that there are no dinosaurs living in the Barun valley. Tales of a wild hairy beast roaming the Himalayas have captured the imagination of climbers in Nepal since the s, prompting many, including Sir Edmund Hillary, to go looking for the creature.  In , Japanese climbers ing from a mountain in western Nepal said they had seen footprints, which they thought belonged to the Yeti. And although they carried long-lens cameras, video cameras and telescopes, they hadnapost seen or taken any photographs of the creature. But scientists have found little evidence of the Yetiaposs existence so far.  In , a group of international researchers studied multiple purported Yeti samples collected from across the Himalayan region and concluded they belonged to bears. In , two men in the United States said they had found the remains of a half-man, half-ape, which was eventually revealed to be a rubber gorilla suit.

Logan is set to ease Aberdeen’s injury crisis by targeting a comeback against Celtic on Saturday.The Dons right-back has been sidelined for three months having undergone ankle surgery in February.Manager Derek McInnes confirmed the -year-old has ed to training and has the weekend’s showdown against the league leaders in his sights.Celtic need just one point at Pittodrie to secure the Premiership title crown.McInnes faces an injury nightmare with skipper Graeme Shinnie, Niall McGinn, Gary Mackay-Steven, Connor McLennan and Tommie Hoban all out.Defender Andy Considine is also suspended having been sent off in the - loss to Rangers at Ibrox.However, Logan is set to deliver a timely boost by ing to action for the first time since a - Scottish Cup defeat of Queen of the South on February .McInnes said: “All being well Shaleum should be involved in the game against Celtic, which is a boost. He was back training last week and has done some bits of work.“Rangers came too quick for him but he will hopefully get a full week’s training this week.“He has worked extremely hard so hopefully Shaleum gets his reward for that. Having him back would help us.”Logan suffered ankle tendon damage in February’s defeat of Queen of the South and had to be taken off in the cup game.His long-term absence was the latest blow for boss McInnes in the weeks after the January transfer window closed.On-loan Tommie Hoban suffered a season-ending cruciate ligament injury in February.Hoban ed to parent club Watford and is expected to be ruled out until October.Defender Hoban is out of contract at Watford at the end of the season although the Hornets will oversee his rehabilitation.McInnes has admitted he would be keen to potentially sign Hoban next seasonhe is fit and available.In reaction to the Logan and Hoban injuries, McInnes secured free agent Greg Halford on a short-term deal.Former Cardf and Wolves defender Halford has made just one substitute appearance with midfielder Dom Ball preferred in the vacant right-back role.McInnes said: “Shaleum has always had the Celtic game in his sights.“That would be his target for the timescale to come backhe had ticked all the boxes, to be available for that one.”In another fitness boost, winger Gary Mackay-Steven has also stepped up his recovery and training schedule.Mackay-Steven has been sidelined since suffering an ankle injury in the - Scottish Cup draw with Rangers on March .McInnes is hopeful the winger, who is set to go out of contract, canto action before the end of the season.“We are still hopeful that hecan be back before the end of the season,” said McInnes.“Gary’s training and running has started to increase his work load. He will not be back for Celtic but maybe before the end of the season.”If Mackay-Steven canto action before the end of the season at Hibs on May  it would deliver a boost to Aberdeen’s Euro bid as all of the Dons’ recognised wingers are out injured or struggling.Niall McGinn is out for the season with an ankle injury and is set to undergo surgery. Teen winger Connor McLennan limped off early in the loss to Rangers after suffering a hamstring tear.He is out for the game against Celtic and the Dons fear he could be ruled out for the season.McInnes said: “McGinn is getting his operation.“We are really short of wide players and hopefully we can get one or two coming back.“We are also without Shinnie.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cc2fdb94c6587.05276450.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet strider tara and bond are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This handsome pup is one year old and has been neutered.Strider is a friendly boy with lots of love to give the right family.He will need a new owner who has the time to continue his training as he is strong and has not been good with other dogs while in the kennels.He is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children due to his boisterous nature.Can you offer Strider his forever home Tara is five years old and has been neutered.This lovely girl is a larger dog who will need a home with access to lots of space for her to run around in and a secure garden as she can jump quite high.She needs a home with no other pets but is used to children over  years old.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest. The screening could not be more prominent. WHP will, however, paint the installation green or brown or whatever colour the local planning authority wishes to see.ldquoThe value of property is not a planning issue, however, in an age where connectivity is ever more important for e-commerce, including: real-time tax s education health services requirement to attract tourists social wellbeing and emergencies there is expected to be a positive value to property as a result of being connected.ldquoNo connectivity in the UK is not acceptable to purchasers in the st century.As a result of the number of objections received, the application will be decided by councillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee.The committee is due to meet on Monday, April  to deliberate on the proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"community-group-targets-steading-to-ease-ettrick-housing-demand","story":"PLANS are in place for a community development company to buy a redundant steading in the Ettrick Valley to ease housing pressures.With many farm and estate cottages being sold over the past decade or so, affordable rentable accommodation in the rural valleys south of Selkirk has dwindled.The Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Companyhope to reverse the trend by buying Kirkhope Steading, outside of Ettrickbridge, and convert the buildings into inexpensive homes to rent.EYCDC have also launched a housing survey to identy the demand for affordable housing in the area.The group have commissioned Rural Housing Scotland to independently run the survey to gauge opinion on affordable rent, buying prices, size and type of home required.A paper copy of the survey, along with a reply paid envelope, can be found in the Post Office in Selkirk, Honey Cottage Caravan Park shop in Ettrick, the Cross Keys pub in Ettrickbridge and from the Gordon Arms in Yarrow.The survey form can also be filled in online at https:www.surveymonkey r TNDLDIn , a full survey was carried out which highlighted a need for more affordable housing in the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys.And it is thought the need has increased signicantly during the past  years.Project Manager of EYCDC, Vicky Davidson said: ldquoWe are concerned that the lack of affordable housing is impacting on the number of children living in the valleys, with fewer families and young people able to find somewhere to live.\"We are urging anyone who might be interested in living in the valleys but do not think they are able to find a suitable house, at an affordable rent, to complete the housing survey as soon as possible.\"And to pass on the survey link to anyone who might like toto live there now or within the next couple of yearsthere was an affordable option available.\"The EYCDCs plans for Kirkhope Steading include some workspace areas and potential office units as well as rentable housing.Funding has been provided by the Scottish Land Fund to carry out an independent valuation, get a structural engineers report and to prepare some architect options for the site.This work is now complete and it was presented to a public meeting in Ettrickbridge on April .The proposal is to start work on the site in the beginning of  and be at completion during spring the following year.For more information contact info@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-chip-in-extra-42k-for-hawick-regeneration-scheme","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has agreed to chip in an extra pound, for a Hawick regeneration scheme, in order to receive a million pound grant from Scottish ministers.The local authority has already been awarded pound.m from Historic Environment Scotland to fund the Hawick Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme .However, the council intended to provide just pound, to the pot, to acquire a pound.m grant, but instead has had to stump up an extra pound, in order to secure pound.m.Along with private sector contributions of pound,, the project will have a budget of pound.m to go towards restoring shop fronts and historic buildings in the town centre.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council executive committee on Tuesday, April , councillors waved through the extra money and emphasised the positives the CARS scheme will bring to Hawick.Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull told the meeting: ldquoThis is a great news item for Hawick and will help with the town centre regeneration.ldquoIrsquod just like to publicly record my thanks to the team which has put in so much work to achieve this, I wish the project well and every success over the next five years.Kelso and District councillor Tom Weatherston, who has experienced the CARS scheme in Kelso, added: ldquoI welcome this as great news for Hawick.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly.

flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

his possessions to fund a two-year volunteering mission across Africa and has ed with a renewed sense of perspective.During his travels across Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda Dominic witnessed violent election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Together, they reached out to the people, especially those who faced disability, discrimination and natural disasters.Naruhito was presented with the imperial sword and jewel, each in a box and wrapped in cloth, at a morning ceremony that marked his first official duty.His we and daughter, Empress Masako and -year-old Princess Aiko, were barred from the ceremony, which only adult male royals, his brother, now Crown Prince Fumihito, and his uncle Prince Hitachi, were allowed to witness.

sports pitches, were formulated last year.However, public consultation showed little appetite for any changes to be made.Dunbar Community Council received word on Monday evening that a further consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local community."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-year-old-praised-for-taking-action-to-stop-dog-fouling","story":"Seven-year-old Ava Lily Davidson, a P pupil at Stoneyhill Primary School, was inspired to make

If approved, two new homes would also be built on the sitersquos eastern boundary, near Dirleton.A supporting statement included in a planning application to East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe Bank of Scotland has been funding the previous expansion of Archerfield and in addition we have been contributing part of the monies raised from selling the [housing] plots at Archerfield.ldquoIt has been quite challenging financing Archerfield up to this point and it has been most beneficial that the [housing] plots at Kings Cairn are now managing to pay back some of the financial support given to us by the Bank of Scotland. To enable the proposed increase in the number of hotel bedrooms [cabins], extensions to the spa and laundry facilities etc, we need to give the bank further comfort to continue supporting our ambition to build Archerfield into Scotlandrsquos premier hotel accommodation with a top-of-the-range spa, golf courses, conference facilities, cinema etc.ldquoThe bank has security over all the property and land at Archerfield but we now need them to extend our facility to allow us to finance the poundm projected costs.If given the green light, the project would also result in further jobs being created with  per cent more staff in line to be employed.Tom Drysdale, who lives in nearby Dirleton, is chairman of Gullane Area Community Council.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Hydropower is used to heat the propertyrsquos water and radiators, enabling the Stewarts to reduce oil consumption, as well as powering the log splitter to feed the stove. ldquoI now use about , to , litres of oil when a house this size would normally require , litres, Mr Stewart added, ldquowhile I get paid for whatever energy is generated regardless of how much actually goes to the Grid.ldquoItrsquos now part of our le.The only downside, he adds, isa dry spell hits and the local farmers opt to use additional local water to irrigate their crops, leaving an insufficient flow to power the system.Hydropower has recently surged in popularity, with dozens of community-run schemes now either in operation or in the planning stages.Hannah Smith, senior policy manager at Scottish Renewables, said: ldquoHydropower is one of Scotlandrsquos great unsung heroes, using our notorious wet weather to provide  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross electricity demand while reducing the carbon emissions which cause climate change.ldquoMr and Mrs Stewartrsquos turbine is one of Scotlandrsquos oldest, and the fact it is still in service in its th year demonstrates how hydro delivers subsidy-free power long after support provided by government has ceased.She added that the Scottish Renewables Hydro Conference, in Perth on May , is set to explore further ways to ensure hydropower technologyrsquos role in the future energy landscape, particularly in wake of the closure of the Feed-in Tarf scheme earlier this month."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9419645.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackay-five-key-issues-the-yes-movement-must-address-if-it-wants-to-win-well","story":"The Yes movement, which in  was vibrant, optimistic and positive, has become typied by marching and shouting. Therersquos a sense that it has degenerated into a st century Grand Old Duke of York. People parade around towns waving Saltires, but to what avail  Whorsquos being convinced  Which minds are being changed :European election results can help Nicola Sturgeon in push for Scottish independenceEven worse than the gesture politics of pointless parades is the dominance of ugly voices among the grassroots. Itrsquos asthe tide went out after the first referendum ndash taking with it the upbeat, the persuasive, the intelligent, the charismatic ndash leaving behind the abusive, the vulgar, the reactionary, the dumb.Instead of the broad spectrum of informed voices and big ideas of , wersquore left with well-meaning marchers going nowhere, and internet trolls in their basements.Many of the problems stem from the vacuum left after defeat in  ndash the base wanted to keep on, but the SNP leadership chose slow, pragmatic, managerial politics. Whorsquod blame them  The SNP is a political party which wants to win office. It had to keep throwing red meat to the base with cries of ldquoindy is coming, while trying to maintain electoral appeal beyond independence voters.There are five key issues the Yes movement must look to ithopes to win independence well. The first is the tone of debate. Before the last referendum, many voters inherently distrustful of nationalism were brought over to Yes because it seemed open and embracing, it offered an alternative to failed Westminster. Progressives and centrists, and even some on the right, found a comfortable home as Yes voters. There was still a brittle, nasty online presence but it seemed of little intellectual importance.However, today, it appears asthis shrill minority is the dominant voice. The table seating needs readjustingtherersquos to be success. Put these petulant ldquoshouty people at the back of the room.This isnrsquot about silencing voices, they are free to say what they please, but those in leadership positions must speak up against this fringe which repels those considering a Yes vote. Stop following these people on social media, stop amplying their nasty messages ndash especiallyyoursquore in elected office.Which takes us to our second point ndash outreach. The Yes movement must once again start chasing voters and not talking to itself. Woo undecideds. Woo Unionists. Woo everyone. Self-congratulatory backslapping does nothing. Waving a Saltire in the face of Unionists wonrsquot win votes. Marching around a town wonrsquot change anyonersquos mind.Itrsquos not just that many in the base of whatrsquos left of the Yes movement arenrsquot attracting enough new voters to their side, some are wilfully deterring newcomers. The use of the derogatory term ldquoYoonto describe Unionists is guaranteed to offend and repel. Do some really believe insulting people and laughing at them will convert anyone  If MI wanted to cook up an intelligence operation to undermine Scottish independence they could do no better than many of the biggest online voices who claim to back Yes.A banner was unveiled outside the SNP conference at the weekend saying ldquoEngland get out of Scotland. We donrsquot need those who would try to make independence ugly. Scotland isnrsquot occupied. England isnrsquot an enemy. The banner was by a member of Scottish Resistance. Resisting who exactly  English paratroopers over Peebles  Get a le and get out of the way of people who really want to change this country for the better.:Scottish independence poll: One in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeons Indyref planItrsquos even worse when those not part of the lunatic fringe embarrass. Also at the SNP conference was Dave Thompson, former SNP MSP and chair of Voices for Scotland which is meant to be an ldquoinclusive\" Yes campaign group. Mr Thompson used Gaelic and Scots to introduce himself to delegates and added: ldquoApologies to those who do not have the two proper languages of Scotland. Really  It may have been a joke, but is this what we want to hear from a party which says it welcomes EU residents Thirdly, the Yes movement needs to get real over dficult questions. Voters have been exhausted and terried by Brexit. The SNP grassroots may want to scrap the pound, but itrsquos not a policy thatrsquos going to win new Yes voters ndash it will only scare them. When it comes to independence, undecideds are now worried about trade deals with England and a possible hard border. Brexit has made independence more dficult as itrsquos raised more questions.No-one sane wants independence to pile on more ision after Brexit. Thatrsquos why the creation of Citizensrsquo Assemblies, to work out the future of Scotland, is a welcome move. Take these big frightening questions directly to the people and to experts and letrsquos hear the evidence and the truth. Momentous change needs rigorous analysis and adult honesty.Fourthly, independence is too big for the SNP alone ndash Scotland is not the SNPrsquos country, it is the peoplersquos, and Citizensrsquo Assemblies can help us work out what is in all our best interests when it comes to our constitutional future, rather than in the narrow interests of one party. It must be said over and over again that a Yes vote is not an SNP vote.I want to see Scotland independent but I want to know the full hard truths before I vote again ndash and I fervently do not want to see this country ided against itself.Perhaps, then, the fth issue is the hardest for many Yes voters to accept ndash that a mere win in any second referendum is not enough, maybe we need to set ourselves a  per cent margin before enacting change. It would be bold, it would ease fears among Unionists, it would show that the Yes movement cares about the country, not just itself, and many may find that appealing and attractive.Most importantly, do we want Scotland in the wake of a close win for independence ndash like a - margin ndash to go through the pain and hatred Britain has already gone through with Brexit  I want independence ndash but I do not want that.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-country-house-hotel-put-up-on-market-at-325m","story":"The -bedroom Leonardo Boutique Hotel Huntingtower, built in Tudor style, is a wedding venue and also generates signicant revenues from meetings and events.

It recommended the introduction of six tests to guide that transition, one of which is the financial requirements of Scottish residents and businesses.ldquoThose tests were back by SNP conference on Saturday. Our position is clear. Until a new currency can be safely and established in the interests of the whole economy, the currency of an independent Scotland should continue to be the pound sterling.Mr Kelly said the SNP wanted to drop the pound immediately, devaluing savings, and would make Scottish families and business ldquosignicantly worse off.Mr Mackay, who was on the Growth Commission, said he was ldquodelighted the currency resolution he co-authored was passed - after activists added ldquoas soon as practicable.He said: ldquoWe have set out, in terms of currency, the position that we continue with the pound. Wersquove set out the tests that will guide our decisions.ldquoIt will be for an independent Scottish Parliament when the time is right -there is that change - based on the right economic position for Scotland.ldquoAnd those tests - fiscal sustainability, central bank credibility, financial requirements of Scottish residents and business, sufficiency of foreign exchange and financial reserves, fit to trade and investment patterns, and correlation of economic and trade cycle - these are sensible tests that would guide such a decision.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos only been three days since the vote at his conference and already the cabinet secretary is in full retreat from the position set out at that conference.He asked what work had been done on the ldquoextra transaction costs for Scots firms trading with the rest of the UK - Scotlandrsquos biggest export market - using a dferent currency.Mr Mackay said: ldquoWe will be keeping the pound on independence, and of course we can build our options as an independent country.ldquoWersquove set out the tests that we would apply to any potential change of currency.ldquoWersquove set out our preferred position. And wersquove also shown, really importantly, how our economic policies would be enhancedwe had the powers of independence.ldquoThat would grow our economy, deliver greater fairness and empower us to make the right decisions by the people of Scotland.In response to SNP MSP Bruce Crawford, Mr Mackay agreed the currency would remain the pound after a Yes vote and only change when an independent parliament decided that.ldquoOur policy is that we will support a change as soon as it can done safely and securely in the interests of the country, the economics of the country, when the time is right.Mr Mackayrsquos comments followed more criticism of the plan to ditch the pound.A former member of and an adviser to the partyrsquos Growth Commission both questioned the move, saying it could jeopardise peoplersquos savings and was not a priority.Richard Marsh, an external adviser to the Growth Commission, warned savers and householders could he hammeredthe new currency has less value than sterling.In , the Scottish Governmentrsquos own Fiscal Commission Working Group warned a new currency was a ldquosignicant undertaking in the short-term, though not unprecedented, and Scotland would need to ldquore-denominate all domestic wages, prices and contracts.Ms Sturgeonrsquos special advisers were unable to say at the weekend whether a new currency would be pegged to sterling - with the Scottish pound worth the same as a UK pound, for example - or float on the international money markets, and potentially be devalued.Mr Marsh said devaluation could wipe out yearsrsquo of savings and leave , householders trapped in negative equity, as their mortgages were recalculated in the new currency.He told the Scottish Daily Mail: ldquoThe Scottish Government may seek to absorb some of this risk to protect mortgage and asset values by pegging the currency.ldquoBut [given] this could be at the cost of public services and delivery, this would be a dficult decision for any new administration to make.ldquoIf Scotland took a lsquobig bangrsquo approach with a new currency set up shortly after a vote for independent, then it would mean businesses, iniduals and the Government would need to take account of movements in exchange rates between the newly established Scottish pound and sterling.Dan Macdonald, a former member of the Growth Commission, said currency was ldquoalmost irrelevant compared to economic growth and ldquosecondary in the independence debate.He said: ldquoWe need plans for the economy over the next five to ten years. That is more important than any one issue, including the constitutional question - we need to build the economy first.Financier Peter de Vink, a friend of Alex Salmond who backed Yes in , said a fledgling independent Scottish currency would be a magnet for speculators.The director of Edinburgh Financial and General Holdings said the result could be worse than Black Wednesday in , when speculators made millions betting on sterlingrsquos devluation, sending interest rates soaring.He said: ldquoThe pound was devalued by  per cent and that was in Britain - Scotland is a tenth of the size, so it would be even more of a problem.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wartime militarist governments worshipped the emperor as a living god until Naruhitorsquos grandfather renounced that status after the countryrsquos  war defeat.Akihito during his three-decade reign embraced an identity as peacemaker and often made reconciliatory missions and carefully scripted expressions of regret on the war. His immersion in that role leaves Naruhito largely free of the burden of the wartime legacy, allowing him to carve his own path.Palace watchers say he might focus on global issues, including disaster prevention, water conservation and climate change, which could appeal to younger Japanese, while also emulating his fatherrsquos focus on peace.That is what many Japanese hope Naruhito will pursue.ldquoI hope the new emperor will be like the Heisei emperor , who cherishes peace, said Takayori Kobayakawa, a -year-old retired person from Shizuoka, central Japan.-- vw,vw,px, px\"The motorcade of Japanrsquos new Emperor Naruhito, second from right, leaves the Imperial Palace--ldquoI have high hopes for him.Naruhito also faces uncertainties in the imperial household.

This is a curious thing, as the proportion of people who actually have a boat is quite small. And yet there is research somewhere – or,there isn’t there should be – that shows that just about everyone at some time or another thinks “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a boat ” In many cases that is as far as it goes in others, the thought becomes a reality and le as they knew it changes forever. That is the essential revelation of boat ownership: nothing is ever the same.Of course, many people do not realise that having a boat is well within their means. Boats can obviously be extremely expensive: a good number of the sleek yachts to be seen in the cruising grounds of the Caribbean and the Mediterranean will not be the fruits of honest labour, but are the status symbols of hedge-fund managers and the like. These boats usually bring unhappiness, in a contemporary Faustian sense, perhaps, as the owners of super yachts will always be jealous of those whose yachts are bigger than theirs. They are just that sort of person. So when, from a tiny passing boat, or from the crowded  of a cheap and cheerful cruise ship, one sees these people basking on recliners on their pristine teak decks, do not imagine that they are happy. They are not.: Extraordinary le of Captain John Isbester recalled in new bookAt the other end of the spectrum – where most of us find ourselves – the urge to have a boat can be very easily satisfied. Small, knockabout boats are not at all expensive, especiallyacquired second-hand. A rowing boat may be bought for a few hundred pounds, as may a kayak. These are boats, and they float,put in the water the right way up. That is something you should perhaps be certain of before you put your newly acquired boat in the water. You should also familiarise yourself with bungs. These, to use land-based language, are the corks that boats have. You will find them down at the bottom, usually at the back . Make sure the cork is in, or your boat will fill with water and sink.You should also be careful what bit of water you put your boat into. Broadly speaking, water falls into two categories: saline and non-saline. Saline water is known as the sea, and it is very dangerous in every respect. Non-saline water is to be found in rivers, lochs and canals. You can put your boat into a river, but remember that when you put a boat in a river it tends to end up in a dferent place from the place in which it was first launched.A loch is a safe bet, although a large loch can get rough in the middlethe wind blows up. As a general rule, the wind is always blowing up, especially during those months in which it is not meant to be blowing up. There are also certain places where the wind is so strong that any form of boating is not recommended. Scotland is one of those places. Greece is another, where there is a wind called the Meltemi that blows up every afternoon.People who buy boats usually have no idea where they want to go in them. As a result, most boats you see in coastal waters are not going anywhere at all, but are simply circling about before theyto the place from which they set out. These places are called marinas, and are highly profitable to the people who run them. They have shops there known as chandleries that will sell you things for your boat. These things are regularly needed as most things already on boats will fall into the sea and require to be replaced.:  of the best sailing holidays in ScotlandThe crew of boats also regularly fall into the sea and require to be replaced. To limit the need for replacement, people wear le jackets. These are now triggered by exposure to water and are self-inflating. In Scotland, where we are all exposed to water in the atmosphere, these le jackets may inflate at odd moments. These occasions can be treated as practice drills.Many delights await youyou are fortunate enough to sail on a slightly larger boat . These are equipped with galleys, where food such as cold sausages, may be prepared. They also have toilets, known as the heads, which are designed to be ecologically sensitive and therefore do not work.Calling in on a harbour in one’s boat is a very particular pleasure. Medical attention will usually be available, and thereafter one may go to a harbour pub and listen to people singing about being out at sea. The usual song is Spanish Ladies, although you will hear The Mingulay Boat Song in places like Stornaway or Ullapool. You do not need to know the words of these songs to sing them to some effect.The happiest day of your le is the day you buy your boat. An even happier day is the day you sell it. The bit in between can be full of joy, too, in its special way. Read Patrick O’Brian and find all about it.

But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used.

While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: Tribute paid to Portadown College principal Simon Harper Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph digital named uks best regional news site","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He promised to abide by the constitution that stripped emperors of political power, and to fulfil his responsibility as a national symbol while “always turning my thoughts to the people and standing with them”.“I sincerely pray for the happiness of the people and the further development of the nation as well as the peace of the world,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  People gather in the compound near Imperial Palace in Tokyo Naruhito is considered a new breed of royal, his outlook forged by the tradition-defying choices of his parents. Emperor Emeritus Akihito devoted his three-decade career to making amends for a war fought in his father’s name while bringing the aloof monarchy closer to the people.Naruhito’s mother, Michiko, was born a commoner and was Catholic educated. Together, they reached out to the people, especially those who faced disability, discrimination and natural disasters.Naruhito was presented with the imperial sword and jewel, each in a box and wrapped in cloth, at a morning ceremony that marked his first official duty.His we and daughter, Empress Masako and -year-old Princess Aiko, were barred from the ceremony, which only adult male royals, his brother, now Crown Prince Fumihito, and his uncle Prince Hitachi, were allowed to witness. Their guests included a female Cabinet minister, however, as the Imperial House Law has no provision on the gender of commoners in attendance.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito with Empress Masako The banning of female royals at the ceremony underscored the uncertain future of a paternalistic imperial family that now has just two heirs.Nevertheless, Japan festively celebrated an imperial succession prompted by retirement rather than death. Many people stood outside the palace Tuesday to reminisce about Akihito’s era others joined midnight events when the transition occurred, and more came to celebrate the beginning of Naruhito’s reign.Dozens of couples lined up at government offices to submit marriage documents to mark the first day of Naruhito’s era, known as Reiwa, or “beautul harmony”.Today marks the beginning of the Japans new era, Reiwa   beautul harmony.

He and his family will continue living at his Togu Palace until they switch places with his parents after refurbishments.Naruhito, , is the nation’s th emperor, according to a palace count that historians say likely included mythical figures until around the th century.The emperor under Japan’s Constitution is a symbol without political power. Wartime militarist governments worshipped the emperor as a living god until Naruhito’s grandfather renounced that status after the country’s  war defeat.Akihito during his three-decade reign embraced an identity as peacemaker and often made reconciliatory missions and carefully scripted expressions of regret on the war. His immersion in that role leaves Naruhito largely free of the burden of the wartime legacy, allowing him to carve his own path.Palace watchers say he might focus on global issues, including disaster prevention, water conservation and climate change, which could appeal to younger Japanese, while also emulating his father’s focus on peace.That is what many Japanese hope Naruhito will pursue.“I hope the new emperor will be like the Heisei emperor , who cherishes peace,” said Takayori Kobayakawa, a -year-old retired person from Shizuoka, central Japan. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The motorcade of Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito, second from right, leaves the Imperial Palace “I have high hopes for him.”Naruhito also faces uncertainties in the imperial household. Crown Prince Fumihito, , and Fumihito’s -year-old son, Prince Hisahito, can currently succeed him. The Imperial House Law confines the succession to male heirs, leaving Naruhito’s daughter out of the running.Naruhito’s we, Empress Masako, is a Hard-educated former diplomat who may prove an adept partner in his overseas travels and activities. But much will depend on her health, since she has been recovering from what the palace describes as stress-induced depression for about  years.

The tense relations are notable given how Mr Barr breezed through his confirmation process, picking up support from a few Democrats and offering reassuring words about the justice department’s independence and the importance of protecting the special counsel’s investigation.The first hint of discontent surfaced last month when Mr Barr issued a four-page statement that summarised what he said were the main conclusions of the Mueller report. In the letter, Mr Barr revealed that he and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had cleared Mr Trump of obstruction of justice after Mr Mueller and his team found evidence on both sides of the question, but did not reach a conclusion.Mr Barr is likely to defend himself by noting how he released the report on his own, even though he did not have to under the special counsel regulations, and that doing so fulfilled a pledge he made to be as transparent as the law allowed. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  There are reports that special counsel Robert Mueller raised concerns over the way his conclusions had been represented He may say that he wanted to move quickly to give the public a summary of Mr Mueller’s main findings, as the justice department spent weeks redacting more sensitive information from the report.After the letter’s release, Mr Barr raised eyebrows when he told a congressional committee that he believed the Trump campaign had been spied upon, a common talking point of the president and his supporters. An insider said Mr Barr, a former CIA employee, did not mean spying in a necessarily inappropriate way and was simply referring to intelligence collection activities.He also equivocated on the question of whether Mr Mueller’s investigation was a witch hunt, saying someone who feels wrongly accused would reasonably view an investigation that way. That was a stark turnabout from his confirmation hearing, when he said he did not believe Mr Mueller would ever be on a witch hunt.Bob Mueller was a great HERO to the Radical Left Democrats. Now that the Mueller Report is finished, with a finding of NO COLLUSION  NO OBSTRUCTION , the Dems are going around saying, “Bob who, sorry, don’t know the man.”— Donald J. TrumpApril , Then came Mr Barr’s April  press conference to announce the release of the Mueller report later that morning.He repeated about a half dozen times that Mr Mueller’s investigation had found no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia, though the special counsel took pains to note in his report that “collusion” was not a legal term, and also pointed out the multiple contacts that took place between the Trump campaign and Russia.In remarks that resembled some of Mr Trump’s own claims, Mr Barr praised the White House for giving Mr Mueller’s team “unfettered access” to documents and witnesses. He suggested the president had the right to be upset by the investigation, given his “sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fuelled by illegal leaks”."},{"url":null,"title":"derry trades union council hosts second annual may day lecture tonight","story":"Derry Trades Union Council will play host to the Second Annual May Day Lecture on May Day, tonight at the Unison Building on Clarendon Street at .pm.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThis years lecture will by delivered by Derrys renowned Irish labour historian and author Dr. Emmet OConnor on the subject of Irish Labour and Chinese Slavery in South Africa, -.\"In  Britain’s Conservative government agreed to address the labour shortage in the Rand goldmines by importing indentured workers from China. By  there were , Chinese in the Transvaal. Well before the first Chinese arrived in June , British trade unionists were alarmed that a precedent was being set for the importation of cheap labour closer to home, and Britain’s ‘Non-conformist conscience’ was disturbed at the spectre of ‘nameless practices’ developing in compounds of young men separated from their families. ‘Chinese slavery’ would be a major factor in the crushing defeat of the Conservatives in the  general election.\"In Belfast, William Walker, Ireland’s best known Labour leader before Big Jim Larkin, made much of ‘Chinese slavery’ in his efforts to become a Labour MP in Belfast North. Hoping to present himself as a patriotic imperialist and build an alliance with the Belfast Protestant Association, Walker raised the issue on Belfast trades council and in the Irish Trades Union Congress, the labour press, and his election campaigns.\"The Irish reaction reveals trade union attitudes towards the empire, South Africa, and race. It also illustrates similarities and dferences between Irish and British labour activists, and between labour leaders in nationalist Dublin and in Unionist Belfast. And it provides an unusual perspective on the controversy about how ‘British’ contemporary Belfast labour actually was.\"The second May Day Lecture and will take place in the Unison Building, Clarendon Street, Derry on the evening of May Day itself, Wednesday May  at .pm.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club. Later, when police checked on the speedboat, they discovered that it had been removed from the mooring.It is believed that the owner of the boat had taken it away, but Strangford police would like the owner to confirmthis was so.KILLOUGH mdash Down councillors have run into snags over their plans to provide playing fields in Killough.The council has applied to the Department of Education for a vesting order for land, but two objections have been entered by residents and the Department wonrsquot proceed until all possible alternatives sites have been investigated.SPA mdash The sixth annual inspection and display of First Spa Company of the Boysrsquo Brigade took place in the Arnold Hall over two nights last week.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

Nothing less than root and branch reform is needed. Indeed,Downing Street was as concerned about ex security force personnel as Theresa May has insisted she is, then it would have already launched a review of how we ever ended up in this scandalous situation.There has been a massive investigative focus on state forces that prevented civil war, costing millions of pounds.The Bloody Sunday inquiry, civil actions , the Police Ombudsman’s Office , the PSNI legacy branch which is % looking into state killings, the section prosecutor orders which are almost all into state allegations. One of the only such orders that is not focused on state is the Stakekne probe, but it is focused on state and terrorist. Any such investigation into intelligence penetration of the IRA should be an attempt to identy the successes of such vital work, and how to improve it in future so that agencies can penetrate and diminish current and future terrorists. It would be unforgivablethe end result of all legacy probes was anything other than a overall celebration of the work the intelligence agencies did in saving le via their brave agents.There have been minor welcome legacy developments: funding for a Hyde Park civil case, a Birmingham massacre inquest, a new focus on Airey Neave’s murder. But this is only the beginning of what is needed. Under no circumstances should a ‘police misconduct’ body be introduced without a comparableto examine terror murder and lesser offences by paramilitaries. If the state is judged to a sub criminal standard, where it is easier to find against them, then so must be terrorists – and on a comparablescale.Doug Beattie: In its desperation to deliver a Stormont

He said that there were areas which “unionism has in the past only touched on a superficial basis, perhaps because of perceptions that it was not worth it given the lack of potential votes”.Mr Dougan accepted that abortion was not primarily an issue for local government but said that it was a topic on which he felt passionately and “I believe these big issues are important” and councillors had a role in lobbying beyond their council work. However, he said that  posters were removed in what he believed was “an organised exercise”.Mr Ó Coigligh said: “I have found huge support for the DUP stance on abortion in nationalist republican areas ... people as erse as a former GAA county captain and a former member of the UDA who served a sentence in Long Kesh in the early s said that cross-community support for the DUP was the way forward and that they admired my modest efforts in this regard.”Mr Dougan said that he had respect for the Irish languaage – and Mr Ó Coigligh translated one of his booklets on Orangeism into Irish – but did not support an Irish language act.DUP-Free Presbyterian tension as party’s gay candidate choice moves it further from church roots Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"would you do a blind interview","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Diversity and inclusion in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays Northern IrelandIn a recent global survey by Hays for International Women’s Day, we asked over , respondents on a scale of one to five how committed their employer was to achieving gender equality. Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/DEB.jpg","title":"debenhams pushes on with cva and store closures","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Debenhams has launched its cost-saving plans as it reveals it will push forward with the closure of  of its stores next year, it has emerged. The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
