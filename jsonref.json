So you can\u0027t say for example only women can apply.\u0027It probably would be a problem due to positive discrimination. It may also be against GDPR.\u0027To ask what their diet or belief is is probably an intrusion into their private information.\u0027But you can have positive action. So if two people of the same level apply for a job you can chose one person over the other for a particular reason.\u0027A spokesman for Acas, the workplace experts, added: \u0027Employers can ask applicants if they have certain protected characteristics only if they can prove it is crucial for the role.\u0027They added: \u0027If you are planning on doing this, Acas recommends you first take legal advice.\u0027Ms Joyce said the post was for a volunteering position not a full-time role.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord zelenskiy skips the pleasantries as he addresses the d%C3%A1il","story":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad on Wednesday. Photograph: MaxwellsThe women from Ukraine sat in the public gallery directly above the Taoiseach. Two months ago they could never have imagined this day, but here they were, unexpected guests of the Irish parliament, still trying to process the tragedy of their new reality.An air of excitement rippled round the Dáil chamber as TDs and Senators gathered for Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address. Diplomats and their aides packed the public gallery. The press gallery was full. The Distinguished Visitors’ Gallery was reserved for Ukrainian ambassador Larysa Gerasko and her party.The sense of occasion was heightened by the many sartorial expressions of silent support for Ukraine, transforming the drab benches into a vibrant canvas of blue and yellow. A sketch artist in the gallery captured the scene.In normal times, the special guest is escorted into the chamber by ushers and noisily applauded. But on Wednesday, the familiar figure of president Zelenskiy silently materialised on two big screens. The politicians turned as one to face him.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl opened proceedings, welcoming “a friend and ally whose people, whose country and whose democratic institutions are under monstrous, bloody and vicious attack”.When his turn came, Zelenskiy did not waste time on pleasantries. “Dear people of Ireland, this night our territory was again hit by Russian missiles.”The atmosphere in the chamber instantly changed. Zelenskiy’s audience listened intently, his chilling words relayed into the strained silence through an interpreter as he listed the latest litany of carnage.On a missionHe was not delivering a speech for the ages. He was on a mission to seek help for his country.Kind words butter no parsnips. But even if they did, there won’t be any to butter this year. It is the sowing season now in Ukraine and Russian troops are planting landmines in the fields.It was hard to comprehend the brutalities this brave, dignified man described: appalling scenes of death and degradation in Bucha and the hopelessly deteriorating conditions in the besieged city of Mariupol, where bombing “continues 247” and “there is not a single house left intact in a city of half a million. None.”When he spoke of bodies left lying in the streets, a young woman in the gallery buried her face in her hands, silently rocking back and forth as her president outlined the depravities inflicted on her compatriots.A little girl with pink bows in her hair sat quietly and closely beside her mother in the back row of the Distinguished Visitors’ Gallery, looking around, wide-eyed, taking everything in.Speaking from his office in Kyiv, Zelenskiy called on Ireland to show more leadership and convince its EU partners to bring in tougher sanctions against Russia. The economic lifeline to Putin’s regime must be terminated. His words will have resonated with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, who chairs the Eurogroup of EU finance minsters.SincereBut Zelenskiy was sincere in his gratitude for what the Irish Government and people have already done for his country.When he signed off with his thanks, the chamber responded with thunderous applause and a prolonged standing ovation. Some TDs were in tears. The four members of People Before Profit-Solidarity got to their feet but did not clap.A principled gesture, but for the day that was in it, it left a bad taste. Richard Boyd Barrett later made an impassioned anti-war speech supporting the people of Ukraine, but little else. The Ukrainians in the gallery did not applaud him. Ideology will not bring back their murdered loved ones and it won’t feed starving people.The Taoiseach spoke with passion and emotion, addressing the screen as if Zelenskiy was there in person. “Russia will have to live with the shame and ignominy of what they have done in Ukraine for generations,” he said, promising full support for Ukraine’s EU application.On the screen, Zelenskiy listened impassively. He looked exhausted but he said what he needed to say, signing off after Martin had spoken. The leaders of the main parties and political groups were yet to come, but everyone understood their honoured guest’s time is precious and hasn’t he suffered enough?Apart from the speech from Boyd Barrett – which may have angered some TDs and Senators but was the socialist deputy’s democratic right to deliver – all speakers agreed that Ukraine must be given every support in repelling the Russian invaders.They said all the right things. But it was the contribution from former Irish army officer Cathal Berry which drew the biggest reaction from the Ukrainian in the gallery.SuggestionPicking up on the president’s plea for more leadership, he had a suggestion to make. “One hour’s drive from here in the Curragh Camp,” he told the Taoiseach, “there are hundreds of anti-tank rockets nearing the end of their shelf life that could very easily be transferred to the Ukraine defence forces.”Directly behind him, Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy shook their heads in disapproval.“Very, very easily done,” said Berry.And in the gallery, the Ukrainians cheered, applauded and waved their flag.Mark Daly, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, closed the session by “welcoming five-year-old Anastasiia to the parliament of our republic”.He said she left Kyiv with her mother, Yana, after their home came under artillery fire. Yana’s husband stayed behind in Ukraine “and is fighting to keep it free and independent for his daughter’s future”.As the chamber cleared, the Taoiseach went up to meet little Anastasiia and her mother. He posed for a photo with her.Yana Semonova lived in Donetsk until the Russians invaded in 2014. She fled to Kyiv. On the first day of the invasion this year, the family went to her in-laws’ home in Makariv about 100km west of the city.They had to leave Makariv under Russian artillery fire, moving back to Kyiv for a few days before moving on to Poland. They arrived in Ireland on March 18th.In his speech, the Taoiseach had told Ukrainians who have arrived in Ireland: “You have safe harbour her for as long as you need it. Our home is your home.”Full coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine"},{"url":null,"title":"you have not remained neutral volodymr zelenskiy thanks ireland in oireachtas address","story":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressing the Dáil and Seanad on Wednesday morning: ‘I’m grateful to you, to every citizen of Ireland, thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia.’ Photograph: Oireachtas TVPAUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said although Ireland is a neutral country, it has “not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine” in an address to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas on Wednesday morning.Speaking via video link, Mr Zelenskiy thanked Ireland for the humanitarian and financial support it has provided to his country.Mr Zelenskiy also called on Ireland to show “more leadership in our anti-war coalition” and convince European Union partners to introduce more rigid sanctions against Russia “that would really make sure that the Russian war machine will stop”.TDs, Senators and foreign diplomats gathered in the Dáil chamber, including Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland Larysa Gerasko, to hear Mr Zelenskiy’s address and gave him a standing round of applause after he spoke.Mr Zelenskiy is the 22nd person to address a joint sitting of the Houses of Oireachtas since the first Dáil was established.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl introduced the Ukrainian president to the Oireachtas, who spoke via a translator.Mr Zelenskiy said since the very first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ireland had supported Ukraine despite being a neutral country.“I’m grateful to you, to every citizen of Ireland, thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia. Thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your caring about Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land.”Mr Zelenskiy said 10 million Ukrainians had been left without shelter as of Wednesday and this was “something we can not come to grips with, but it means that Russia hasn’t yet abandoned their plans”.Mr Zelenskiy said there must be an end to trading with Russia and he could not tolerate “any indecisiveness” after everything Ukraine had gone through.“We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed Russian military machinery with new sources of funding.”Mr Zelenskiy said a principled approach of some political and business leaders, who still thought that “war and war crimes is not something as horrific as financial losses”, was lacking.“I am sure that your leadership can make a difference and change this,” he added. “I’m sure that the whole of Europe will be able to stop this war and bring peace and stability in the east of Europe.“We cannot delay any longer, the longer this aggression of Russia will continue, the worse will be the consequences, not only for our continent but neighbouring regions.”Hunger, killingsMr Zelenskiy outlined some of the losses and damage Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion began on February 24th.He said 42 days since the war began, at least 167 children have been killed, 927 educational institutions damaged, as well as 258 hospitals, and 78 ambulances have been shot at.Mr Zelenskiy said Russia was targeting sea ports and vessels and they were using hunger “as a weapon” against “ordinary people . . . as an instrument of domination”.He said there would be a food shortage and prices would go up, adding that in the city of Mariupol, Russia was blocking humanitarian access to half a million people.“They’re not allowing anything to come through, neither water nor medication,” he said. “While it was snowing, people could melt the snow to get water, now they don’t even have that. They are bombing 247 . . . there is no single house left intact in a half a million city, none.“The dead and killed were simply buried in the yards of the condominiums and in many cases they couldn’t even do that, the bodies were just left there lying on the streets in the remnants of the buildings, in the basements, and we don’t know how many citizens of Mariupol have been killed by Russia.”‘Ukraine will prevail’Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland was “resolute” in its solidarity and support for Ukraine and thanked Mr Zelenskiy for his “heartfelt, honest, clear and historic address” to the Houses of Oireachtas.Mr Martin said Russia would have to live with “the shame and ignominy of what they have done in Ukraine for generations”.“Those responsible will be held to account,” he said. “We are with Ukraine and I am certain that in the end, Ukraine will prevail.“We are a military-neutral country. However, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of war crimes, quite the opposite.”Mr Martin said Ireland’s position was informed by “the principles that drive our foreign policy support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order”.“We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles,” he said.The Russian ambassador to Ireland Yury Filatov did not accept an invitation to the event after Mr Ó Fearghaíl invited all of the diplomatic representations based in the State to the address.Full coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine"},{"url":null,"title":"people before profit tds defend decision not to clap for zelenskiy oireachtas address","story":"Video footage from the Dáil chamber shows the People Before Profit TDs stood, but did not applaud.

Footage from the Dáil chamber showed Paul Murphy, Richard Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny and Bríd Smith standing after the speech but not applauding with the other TDs and Senators present. Mr Murphy later said he and Mr Boyd Barrett had “stood for the people of Ukraine and stand with them in the struggle against the Russian imperialist invasion”.However, he added: “We can’t applaud calls for more sanctions which are hurting ordinary Russians and only bolstering the Putin regime at home.” Mr Murphy also criticised steps taken by Mr Zelenskiy’s government in domestic politics, particularly the banning of “opposition parties with almost 20 per cent of the vote”, which was a “worrying attack” on democratic rights. Mr Murphy said that he and Mr Boyd Barrett had also not applauded Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s declaration of support for Ukrainian membership of the EU, which was a matter for the Ukrainian people to decide.Ms Smith said the group “stood in solidarity and respect” for the Ukrainian people, their president and the “war crimes they are suffering at the hands of Putin”. She said they disagreed with calls made previously for Nato involvement in the war, which could “escalate an already dangerous situation”. ‘Extraordinary’Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney later said the group’s decision did not “reflect the views of the vast, vast majority of our people”.“The idea that you wouldn’t stand and applaud his courage, his bravery, his leadership, but also out of respect for what his country is going through, to my mind, is extraordinary,” he said. Minister of State Patrick O’Donovan said it was a “source of terrible embarrassment” to be in a chamber where members had refused to clap. He accused the People Before Profit TDs members of a “warped ideology” in seeking to support the country Ukraine but not its leader. He accused them of bringing shame on the House and asked them to apologise. Meanwhile, Donegal Independent TD Thomas Pringle said he clapped initially out of solidarity with the Ukrainian people but then stopped because he was concerned about what he described as the “talking up” of NATO and what he felt were attacks on Irish neutrality.Video from the Dáil shows Independent TDs Catherine Connolly and Joan Collins not clapping, although it is thought they adopted a similar approach to that of Mr Pringle. Ms Collins and Ms Connolly did not initially respond to queries on Wednesday. Following Mr Zelenskiy’s address, several Government TDs applauded Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald’s call to eject the Russian ambassador, Yuriy Filatov, from the State.

I felt fear and a little bit of craziness, but there was no doubt that it was a just cause,” he added.Such views are held across Argentina, where street names reference Las Malvinas, the Castillian name for the remote archipelago, and where neighbourhood walls are adorned with murals depicting the islands in the sky blue and white of the Argentine flag. Along with the late Diego Maradona, the Falklands are also a favourite tattoo for many working-class Argentines.One poll last year found that 81 per cent of Argentines wanted Buenos Aires to continue its efforts to recover the Falklands from the United Kingdom. Equally, Argentines today overwhelmingly agree that the campaign should be pursued exclusively through peaceful, diplomatic channels.Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and foreign minister, compares the UK’s acquisition of the Falklands to Russia’s seizure of rebel enclaves in eastern Ukraine. “For Argentines, Luhansk and Donetsk remind us of the Malvinas,” he says.That belief is rooted in geography – with the islands located on a continental shelf 300 miles from Argentine Patagonia but 8,000 miles from the UK – and history. The Falklands were first discovered, uninhabited, by a British expedition in 1690. They subsequently passed through British, French, US and Spanish hands, with Madrid controlling the islands when Argentina declared its independence in 1816. The UK then occupied them in 1833, expelling a Hamburg-born trader who Buenos Aires had charged with exploiting the islands’ resources.The history resonates so much, says Carlos De Angelis, a sociologist at the University of Buenos Aires, because Argentina’s borders have remained relatively unchanged since independence. British sovereignty of the Falklands is perhaps the most significant perceived foreign intervention during the nation’s 200-year history.That context is something all Argentines are taught at school and is often repeated by politicians, especially the former president and current vice president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, of the Peronist party. In a typically symbolic move, Peronist politicians last month proposed renaming Rivadavia Avenue, one of Buenos Aires’ principal thoroughfares, “Argentine Malvinas Avenue”. They claimed the move was a tribute to the 649 Argentine servicemen who died during the Falklands conflict and even greater number of veterans who subsequently took their own lives.On the anniversary itself on Saturday, president Alberto Fernández led a ceremony with veterans and families of the fallen at the recently-opened Museum of the Malvinas in the Argentine capital. “The Malvinas are Argentine and also Latin American,” he said.The Falklands can also be used in Argentina to attack rivals. Last year, the opposition politician Patricia Bullrich, who had been a minister during the 2015-2019 centre-Right presidency of Mauricio Macri, which had downplayed the Falklands claim, made the mistake of joking about the islands, suggesting Buenos Aires use them to secure Pfizer Covid vaccines. She was forced to apologise after national uproar.“In school, they place a lot of emphasis on 1833. It’s a watershed. The islands are a feeling, an idea that unites all Argentines,” says Juan Bautista, 24, an international relations student at the Catholic University of Córdoba.He also draws parallels between Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and the decision by Galtieri’s military dictatorship to invade the Falklands in 1982: “In both cases, an authoritarian government sought to revindicate itself through a nationalist military adventure.”Yet Argentine curriculums do encourage independent thinking, says Gabriel Luna, 21, a film student at Buenos Aires’ National Arts University, who is more indifferent about the Falklands. “I just don’t like nationalism, or shouting your beliefs in other people’s faces,” says Luna. “Nationalism is harmful.”The Falklands war had profound consequences for Argentina – most obviously in hastening the fall of the junta.The dictatorship was already in serious difficulties when it launched the invasion, having presided over an economic collapse – including a 10-fold devaluation of its currency – and under increasing international pressure for its brutal, paranoid suppression of dissent, “disappearing” thousands of real and perceived political opponents. Just days before Argentine troops’ amphibious assault on the Falklands, an estimated 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Buenos Aires to protest – at the time, an unprecedented show of bravery against the dictatorship.The national mood was turned, briefly, on its head by the grab of the Falklands. Two days after Argentina had seized the islands, some 100,000 cheering, flag-waving citizens crowded into the Plaza de Mayo, the square that had previously become the venue of the lonely protests of the mothers of the disappeared.The euphoria was not to last. As swiftly as the British Armed Forces proved their superiority over their Argentine counterparts, the mood in the country turned to fury against a military government that had even proven incompetent at what was, supposedly, its speciality, namely fighting wars.“The invasion was like the grasping of a dying man,” says Dr De Angelis. “But it backfired completely. These generals and admirals were seen as not even able to organise a military campaign, as opposed to dealing with unarmed Argentine civilians.Veterans of the war were also treated as a national embarrassment. Mr González, who eventually forged an eclectic career working the lights in a theatre, as a security guard and teacher, recalls how prospective employers would see the stamp denoting that he was a veteran on his national identity card and then decline to hire him.“Employers didn’t want veterans. They thought we were trouble, difficult. They never said that to your face, but you knew,” he says. Four decades on, his life remains marked by that brutal month he spent on the Falklands, including occasional stabbing pains in his toes.“For me, it was a war between two governments, not against the British people. It’s clear the junta were criminals. They did unforgivable things – kidnap, torture, murder.“I think the British are a civilised people, with their mistakes, of course, like any other people. When I was captured, I was treated in a gentlemanly way. But I still believe in the Malvinas, and I don’t have any doubt that sooner or later, they will be Argentine.”More from NewsNorth Korea could hold nuclear test as soon as next weekThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Ukraine can ‘absolutely’ win the war, says US Thousands of adults to partake in UK\u0026#39s first cannabis clinical trialInquiry to probe leak of Queen’s death plansMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"allowed transition 18 without question regretted","story":"The debate about trans identities and gender dysphoria has become very polarised – even for those of us who have lived through it.When the Government announced this week it would not go ahead with a Bill to ban conversion therapy for trans people, my response was mixed. At 18, I’d been prescribed testosterone by a private GP so I could transition to living as a man. The GP didn’t attempt to explore the possible causes of my gender dysphoria, such as my mental health problems or my difficulties fitting in socially. But even if they had, I might have insisted on going ahead anyway. I thought I knew everything about myself – nobody could tell me what to do.  I was raised in Lancashire, in a very masculine environment. My mum used to work nights, so I was looked after by my dad. I also had two stepbrothers, eight years older. I wasn’t brought up with them, but we did socialise as I was growing up. After my parents orced when I was 11, I spent a lot of time with my dad because my mum used to work three jobs.When I started school, I struggled to make friends with other girls. I didn’t care for Groovy Chick, or Barbie or Bratz – I just wanted to play football. There were a lot of social rules to female friendships. Male friendships were just so much easier: we’d fall out, we’d fight, we’d make up, we’d forget about it the next day.High school was a particularly difficult time. When I was about 11, I became convinced I was meant to be a boy. My male friends were all developing differently to me, and in turn that made me feel like I wished I had what they had – they were stronger and more outgoing. On Tumblr and YouTube, I discovered trans people who argued that some people who are meant to be male are accidentally born female. I thought: this is the answer! I was gender dysphoric, I was meant to be born male and there was no other reason why I might not get on with women.At the same time, I began feeling sexually attracted to girls, though later I realised I was bisexual. Aged 12, I developed depression and anxiety. I had a few sessions with a counsellor, who used words such as “borderline”, “bipolar” and “manic”. My parents didn’t really know what to do, and support from the school was minimal. It was my boyfriend, who I met in high school and who is also bisexual, who gave me the most support.To add to my distress, when I was 14 I was sexually abused by a stranger after being groomed online. I told my parents, who reported it to the police. Eventually, the perpetrator was tried and sent to prison. It was a hugely traumatic period.I started experimenting with my gender presentation and on Instagram and Tumblr, I changed my pronouns to heshe. I thought I was gender-fluid because the concept of transitioning was too scary. I was only 13 or 14 at this point. Some days I wanted to be girly, other days I wanted to dress like a man.In my final year at school, I remember saying to my boyfriend that I needed to pick a side. Some days I would say my pronouns are “hehim” and others I would say, my pronouns are “sheher”. Before going to college I swallowed my dysphoria, and for the next two years of my life I decided I was going to be as girly as possible and blend in and be totally normal.But when I was 18 and did my last exam, I suddenly decided I needed to go ahead with this transition. The big narrative being pushed is that transition will be the answer to all your problems. I confided in my boyfriend and he was very supportive because, back then, he assumed that doctors knew what they were doing.The NHS waiting time for hormones is about five or six years, so I saved up enough money from my gap year job to pay for private gender therapy. In March 2018, I contacted Gender GP, an online health and wellbeing clinic for transgender people and was given a 30-minute phone consultation costing £300 I never had a face-to-face consultation. In June, I was prescribed hormones. There was no exploration of my sexual trauma, and no mention of my upbringing and how that could have affected things.The consultation included a question about fertility risks and whether I wanted children. Because of what I’d read on social media, I knew I needed to say ‘no’ in order to be prescribed hormones. They didn’t tell me all the potential side effects, such as heart problems and loss of bone density, or the extent to which it could impact fertility.(A spokesman for the online gender clinic, GenderGP, says: “We operate an informed model of care – that means we start from a position of belief if you say you are trans. Our job is not to try and validate your gender, or prove whether you are trans. Our job is to support you to make the best decisions.”)For the first year or so, I was over the moon. I changed my name to Ryan. It took about three months to see changes, which included developing more muscle mass and broader shoulders. My periods stopped, which I was very happy about. Socially, I enjoyed going out and being read as male, and was pleased to no longer attract unwelcome sexual attention from men. My relationship with my boyfriend was pretty much the same, though when we went out we did sometimes attract invasive questions about how we had sex.I was a lot more emotionally stable – no longer having the up-and-down emotions that girls tend to have as a result of a hormonal cycle. My friends were all very accepting. Although my dad found the name change difficult, he said that as I was an adult, I could do what I wanted. I had been binding my breasts and had saved up £7,000 to pay for a double mastectomy, but in the end decided it would be better to spend it on travelling or buying a house. I’m glad I didn’t go ahead.Then during my first term at the University of Lancaster, where I was studying psychology, I went through a bad mental health episode. After attempting suicide, I was referred to a social worker. When I explained to him that I’d always felt like an outcast and struggled if things weren’t routine, he suggested I might have autism.After being referred to specialists for an assessment, my autism diagnosis was confirmed. It was like having pieces of a jigsaw come together, enabling me to see the full picture.About six months later, I decided to come off testosterone. The online clinic advised me not to come off it altogether, because of my gender dysphoria, and recommended instead that I halve my dose. Initially, I did this, but when my periods came back, I decided to stop it altogether. I didn’t speak to any other medical professionals and didn’t have any more contact with the clinic, except to cancel my £30 monthly subscription fee.Although I had felt happy passing as male, I was never 100 per cent comfortable. I was constantly worried about whether I looked too female. A part of me felt like I was lying to myself and others.Fertility was another big factor. When I turned 20, I realised I really wanted a family – and I had chosen to self-sterilise for no good reason.I felt embarrassed about detransitioning, but friends and colleagues were very supportive, although my dad was concerned and had a lot of questions. Initially, I missed the emotional stability I’d had on testosterone. I also hated getting my periods back, because ever since detransitioning, my menstrual cycle has been an absolute mess, and I am now being investigated for polycystic ovary syndrome. Apart from this, given my periods have returned, I should be able to conceive.Physically, one of the most difficult things has been the amount of body hair I’ve been left with – I still need to shave a lot. My voice is deeper than it used to be.But it’s great to be able to dress up again. And my boyfriend has been fine with me detransitioning – the good thing about dating a bi dude is they don’t care either way.The main advice I’d give to others with gender dysphoria is to wait until you’re 21 before going on hormones. Let your body be an adult woman’s body before you decide to change it.  And listen to detransitioner stories, such as those of Sinead Watson and Keira Bell. If you believe you might have some sort of neuroergence or a history of abuse, think about how those things might have affected you.I’m now 22 and feel a lot better. I dropped out of my original university course and from September I plan to study criminology at a different university. What’s been nice is that I now accept my body. I do experience pangs of dysphoria, but they’re nowhere near as frequent as they used to be. My long-term plan is to become a probation officer – and I look forward to a future that includes children.If you need support with a family member who’s struggling with gender dysphoria, you can contact Genspect at info@Genspect.org.More from NewsNorth Korea could hold nuclear test as soon as next weekThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Ukraine can ‘absolutely’ win the war, says US Thousands of adults to partake in UK\u0026#39s first cannabis clinical trialInquiry to probe leak of Queen’s death plansMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nasty shock isle wight motorists electric car charging points","story":"Electric car owners have been left bewildered after public charge points on the Isle of Wight were hacked to show pornography.Screens on devices at the council’s car parks in Ryde, Cowes and Freshwater are supposed to display the council’s own website, but some featured flashing explicit images instead.Council officials were left scrambling to visit the hacked devices around the island, so they could cover up the screens that were displaying the “inappropriate” third-party site.Road users spotted the blunder after they struggled to access the charge points while they were rebooted.An Isle of Wight council spokesman said: “We are saddened to learn that a third-party web address displayed on our electric vehicle signage appears to have been hacked. “The council would like to apologise to anyone that may have found the inappropriate web content, and for any inconvenience from charge points out of action.”It added that the charge points were originally part of the Chargepoint Genie network, but have recently been transferred to the GeniePoint network.With a ban on new petrol and diesel cars sold in the UK after 2030 and hybrid sales banned from 2035, electric vehicles and their infrastructure are growing increasingly popular.The RAC estimates that there are about 460,000 zero-emission battery electric vehicles on the UK’s roads – 64,000 have so far been registered this year – along with more than 384,000 plug-in hybrids.A report last year by Pen Test Partners, a cybersecurity consultancy firm, identified several security flaws in devices used by six mainstream electric vehicle charging brands, including the potential for user accounts to be hacked.For public charging station networks, theft of electricity at the expense of driver accounts and manipulating chargers by turning them on or off were identified as other threats.Experts have also raised fears of criminal gangs extorting NHS ambulances by hacking their software using the “Brokenwire” technique. The University of Oxford team behind the discovery told The  last week that charging electric vehicles can be interrupted from up to 50 yards away using off-the-shelf equipment, such as software-defined radios, potentially blocking users from using them.More from NewsNorth Korea could hold nuclear test as soon as next weekThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Ukraine can ‘absolutely’ win the war, says US Thousands of adults to partake in UK\u0026#39s first cannabis clinical trialInquiry to probe leak of Queen’s death plansMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west must show putin collective strength","story":"The war in Ukraine is not the one Vladimir Putin planned. He has badly over-reached and is now suffering the consequences. But this is not the time for complacency. Russia is not retreating, but regrouping. Putin has changed his tactics, not his strategy. His forces are leaving the area around Kyiv only to push harder in the East and the South.The world has seen the appalling atrocities his forces have committed in Irpin and Bucha. Civilians have been targeted – there is evidence of butchery, rape and torture. We must do all we can to ensure Putin fails. That is why the UK is stepping up under the Prime Minister’s six-point plan of action.We are delivering on his plan by strengthening Ukraine’s defence with next-generation anti-tank weapons, Javelin missiles and Starstreak anti-aircraft systems. We are working as one of the largest humanitarian donors to mobilise an international coalition. We have joined forces with our friends to apply huge economic pressure on Putin’s regime with sanctions and to isolate him on the world stage. We are working to ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table when Putin is serious about diplomacy. And we are working to strengthen security and resilience across the Euro-Atlantic area.In the last few days, I have stood alongside my Ukrainian and Polish counterparts in making clear our determination to help Ukraine in every way we can. Today, I am joining our Nato and G7 partners in Brussels, where we will unite in taking further action to ensure Putin fails.After he invaded Georgia and Crimea, the free world did not do enough to respond. This emboldened him and we must learn the lessons. Now is the time to be strong to ensure we see off Putin’s aggression for good. We need to double down in supporting Ukraine so that it prevails over Putin and restores its sovereignty. When a European democracy is standing up to tyranny, we will not hesitate to help it defend itself.But we must go further to cripple Putin’s war machine through sanctions. I am working with our G7 partners to crack down on more Russian banks and agree a clear timetable to eliminate our imports of Russian oil, gas and coal. I am also encouraging them to join the UK in banning Russian ships from our ports and putting Russian gold beyond Putin’s reach.We must strengthen Nato’s own defence by reinforcing our presence in the East and ensuring that we have the agility to strike aggressors where they are least expecting it. We must also adapt for the future by raising our collective spending and investing in modern capabilities to face the threats of tomorrow, whether they be on Nato’s frontiers or in space and cyber.The UK is proud to be the largest defence spender in Europe. I applaud those nations – from Germany and Italy to Sweden and Poland – who have stepped up to boost their budgets.We need to redouble our efforts to support other countries whose territory Putin covets. We cannot allow sovereign democracies like Georgia and Bosnia to be subject to malign interference and must be ready to strengthen their defences. We need to also be vigilant about Russia’s damaging actions beyond Europe by taking on Moscow’s meddling in places like the Levant and the Sahel.We need to rebuild our international security architecture. We can no longer labour under outdated agreements with Russia that they blatantly disregard and undermine. The days of the Nato-Russia Founding Act are over.If and when we do engage, it will be on our terms. Our starting point will be our resilience, defence and deterrence, and that Russia faces justice for its heinous crimes. This approach should also recognise newer threats such as an increasingly assertive China.Finally, we need to rally our friends around the world to isolate the Putin regime further. As the evidence piles up of war crimes in Ukraine, Russia’s membership of the UN Human Rights Council is unconscionable.Of course, the world won’t simply follow the West, so we must show them that free democracies offer a better alternative as honest and reliable partners – from trade and investment to technology and defence.For Nato to remain at the vanguard of global security, it must be bold. As President Eisenhower, the alliance’s first supreme commander, said: “History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.”In that spirit, we must show our collective readiness to rise to the challenge. Putin is not just imperilling Ukraine but the security of Europe and the wider world. We need to be decisive, determined and dogged to end his brutal war. Together, we will ensure that Ukraine prevails. Ultimately, this is how we will secure a safer, more peaceful world.Liz Truss is the Foreign SecretaryMore from NewsNorth Korea could hold nuclear test as soon as next weekThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Ukraine can ‘absolutely’ win the war, says US Thousands of adults to partake in UK\u0026#39s first cannabis clinical trialInquiry to probe leak of Queen’s death plansMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pm refuses accept responsibility brits","story":"PM refuses to accept responsibility as Brits struggle to pay for fuel and foodBoris Johnson accepted today that the poorest households in Britain were having to choose between heating and eating.

The Koran states: “But to fast is best for you,you only knew.” Nearly , years later we are only just learning of the benefits of intermittent fasting – people managing to reverse health conditions and look younger and feel fitter as a result of this.This year we are free from the restrictions of Covid, the mosques are full of worshippers, and we can visit friends and family. But this year there is another menacing shadow – the cost-of-living crisis. Ramadan is not just about fasting but also about feasting. We open the fast with a simple date and water, as the prophet Muhammad would do, then tuck into lavish, lovingly cooked meals. This year, many Muslims are feeling hungry, not because they are fasting, but because they can’t afford to eat. The charity Islamic Relief adds that % of Muslim households are living in poverty and struggling to put food on the table. We’ve always thought of poverty – actual sick-to-the- stomach hunger – as being something that happened in far-flung countries, but it is happening right here at unprecedented levels. With rocketing fuel prices, the supermarket shelves empty because of Brexit lies, and the staggering rise in energy costs, many of us aren’t just “feeling the pinch”, we are being squeezed to death.

Elise Mallia, , and Jessy Jezequel, , found themselves  miles away from their home destination after trying to fly back from Marseille. The pair had made a whistle stop tour of the port town to watch a football match against Nice - but ended up unexpectedly extending their trip with a little journey to the Spanish capital of Madrid. It wasnapost until the couple were making their descent into Madrid that they realised the mix-up. Elise, an estate agent from Fulham, said: An hour into our flight, Jesse said he thought he heard a flight attendant say Madrid, but we thought he had dreamed it. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But after that we started realising all the flight attendants were speaking Spanish. When we asked, they told us we were going to Madrid - and we had no idea how that was possible. She added theyaposd had their boarding passes scanned three times before boarding the flight and assumed they must have been wrong - but when they checked, they werenapost. We were baffled and so were the flight attendants, she said. We got home in the end, but we still have no idea how it happened. Itaposs not like getting the wrong bus - we literally ended up in a dferent country!  The couple were booked on a flight from Marseille to Stansted shortly before pm on March , and headed towards what they believed was the correct gate to board. Elise said she swore she saw aposMadridapos on the neighbouring gate to theirs. She recalled even making a joke to Jesse that they should continue their holiday and go to Spain instead of ing to London - not realising that may actually be the case. Elise said: Surely it must be quite hard to actually get on the wrong plane because of the security! Well, that was what we thought. The pair did eventually make it back to Fulham, but five hours later than planned. We were panicking and tried to explain to the staff that we werenapost supposed to be in Spain, Elise said.Everyone thought we were crazy at first - until we showed them our boarding passes. How did nobody notice our boarding passes, or notice there were two extra passengers on the flight  Surely you shouldnapost be able to get on the wrong plane without anybody noticing! They said they have been unable to get in touch with Ryanair since the incident - still have no idea how it happened. A spokesperson for Ryanair said: Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia boarded their flight from Marseille to London Stansted through the correct gate. However, these passengers then failed to follow the allocated route to the aircraft departing for London Stansted, crossed an unauthorised area and wrongly boarded a flight departing to Madrid. Both passengers were able to occupy the same seats they had booked for their original flight, as this flight was not fully booked, thus not alerting them to their error at this time. An announcement advising passengers of their final destination and estimated time of arrival is made before every flight departure – which should have alerted Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia that they were on the wrong aircraft. Upon arriving at Madrid Airport, these passengers then realised their error and Ryanair staff were notied of these misrouted passengers. Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia were accommodated on a flight from Madrid to London Stansted later that day. It is each passenger’s responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft.”Have you had a travelling disaster  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ryanair\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Although it was found half a century later, the love letters didnt sail farThe mother and daughter managed to get in contact with the original writers of the letter after posting on social media Image: Scunthorpe Litter Pickers   SWNSByAdam DuttonSamantha Mordi:,  Apr |commentsA bottle containing cheeky messages from two teenage girls asking for boyfriends has washed up after drting in a UK river for  years. The corked glass bottle was discovered by a group of volunteer litter pickers who were cleaning up the Humber Estuary in Lincolnshire. Tracey Marshall, , and her daughter Charlotte, , found the messages in a bottle while working for Scunthorpe Litter Pickers. Mum-of-three Tracey said: Weaposd been litter picking on the Humber estuary. My daughter noticed the bottle in the reeds and in the mud and was quite buried but you could just see the top of the bottle poking out. Charlotte dragged it out and cleaned it and noticed there was something inside. We find a lot of bottles and usually put them in a recycling bag but this one had a cork so it pricked our attention so put it to one side.  When we had finished the litter pick we tried to get the notes out but couldnapost so we actually smashed the bottle. Inside were two rolled up notes, they were very very rolled up in cellophane over the top of them. We eventually got them open and they were two letters. Itaposs really exciting, we couldnapost believe it when we found them. I just popped it on social media and didnapost expect it to blow up as much as it did. Inside were two scribbled notes written by -year-old pals Jenner Coleman and Janet Blankley dated August , . The love-lorn pair wrote descriptions of themselves and invited teenage boys who found the bottle to write back to them. Janet wrote: I am , not bad looking, long wavy brown, chestnut hair and apos.Anyone interested, a photo will be exchanged in person. Boy who writes. No one under  or over .  Jenneraposs note said: Anyone who finds this please contact J Coleman. Please writeyou are a boy under  over . Please send photo and one will be exchanged. Thank you. The girls both included their addresses in Grantham, Lincs. It is thought the girls were on a day trip to South Ferriby near Scunthorpe when they tossed the bottle into the river. Tracey continues: One of the ladies emigrated to Australia in . Iaposve spoken to her a lot. Weaposre actually going to send her the letter back. Jenner Anne Coleman. She was  when she wrote the letter with her friend and tossed it in the river in the Boston, Skegness area. Ironically, they tossed the bottle into this spot, so it obviously hasnapost gone far in all these years. We find some weird and wonderful things. We were like big kids when we find things. Incredibly, Tracey was able to track Jenner down on social media and discovered she moved to Australia with her family in . Jenner, now aged , said: Janet and I were good friends at school we spent a lot of time together during school holidays, we went our separate ways once we finished school. I had completely forgotten about the message in the bottle and it is in such good condition after half a century, unbelievable. I canapost believe it was in the water for that long. I think itaposs hilarious and unbelievable that itaposs been there for  years just lying around. I vaguely remember sending it. I just thought it would be interestingwe ever got a reply from our notes. She adds: You did used to hear about messages in bottles in my childhood but I donapost think we gave it another thought afterwards. I lived in Grantham until I was . I canapost believe the letters were so well preserved after so many years. Jenner had family in Ferriby at the time she and Janet wrote the notes, and so spent a lot of time in the area and going to Cleethorpes in the summer.

It has today been announced that diners will see the calorie content of dishes on menus as part of a Government drive to tackle obesity.Businesses with  or more employees in England, including cafes, restaurants and takeaways, will be required to display the calorie information of non-prepacked food and soft drinks prepared for customers. Many donapost want to knowthe food they are eating is bad for them and say they will now feel guilt-tripped - while others are concerned that it could potentially encouraging eating disorders.Some of the UKaposs most caloric meals have been thrust into the spotlight as the move to improve the nationaposs health begins. Toby Carveryaposs All You Can Eat Breakfast is one of the worst, coming in at a belt-busting , calories. Miller and Carteraposs Smoky Barbecue Ribs are nearly as bad fro you, while the Flame Grill Combo from Beefeater comes in at , calories. There was also shock at Subwayaposs popular Mega Meat footlong with Doritos and Nandoaposs Fino Pitta with peri-salted chips and garlic bread both being over , calories. People have taken to social media to register their surprise as the move ided opinion among industry leaders and diners. One person tweeted: Just been for an all you can eat breakfast at Toby Carvery!!! Guess i’m not eating again now till thursday! #breakfast.Another said: Bc of the change in the UK where calorie info has to be on everything, I’m really struggling - one slice of pizza is literally more calories than I feel comfortable eating in a full meal. A third put: I actually can’t get over a Yorkshire pudding from Toby Carvery being  calories. Another said: Nearly , cals in #Nandoaposs pitta meal I thought it was healthy lol! Calories will need to be displayed at the point of choice for the customer, such as physical menus, online menus, food delivery s and food labels. The measures, which form part of the Governmentaposs wider war on obesity, have been introduced to help consumers make more informed, healthier choices when eating out or ordering takeaways. It is estimated that overweight and obesity-related conditions cost the NHS £. billion each year.Almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese - and one in three children leaves primary school at an unhealthy weight. In a Public Health England survey on calorie reduction, % of respondents said they think menus should include the number of calories in food and drinks. However, the move has received a mixed response, with one charity warning the move will negatively affect people with eating disorders.  Tom Quinn, director of external affairs at Beat, said the eating disorder charity was extremely disappointed. He said: We know from the people we support that including calories on menus can contribute to harmful eating disorder thoughts and behaviours worsening. For instance, it can increase a fixation on restricting calories for those with anorexia or bulimia, or increase feelings of guilt for those with binge-eating disorder. There is also very limited evidence that the legislation will lead to changed eating habits among the general population . million people in the UK have an eating disorder, and sadly we know that the pandemic has contributed to more people than ever before needing support for these serious mental illnesses. Beat has continually asked the Government to consider the impact on people affected by eating disorders and to take an evidence-based approach when creating health policies. This should involve consulting eating disorder clinicians and experts by experience at every stage of the process.  Wagamama has said it will now offer two menus. They say one will have calories displayed and there will be one without on request. Wagamama CEO Thomas Heier said: After two years of working with our charity partners Young Minds, disordered eating for young people is something weaposre acutely aware of. As calories become a legal necessity for all restaurants, weaposve decided to offer a non-calorie menu for guests suffering with a challenging relationship with food.Mark Selby, co-founder of Mexican street food restaurant Wahaca, told the BBC : It tells part of the story but I think it slightly misses out some quite important fundamentals around food - be it nutrition, fibre, all those things - which potentially we feel might be more relevant or certainly need to be considered.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: Obesity is one of the biggest health issues we face as a country and clear food labelling plays an important role in helping people make healthier choices for themselves and their families. We are all used to seeing nutritional information on products sold in supermarkets and displaying calorie information on menus can help us consume fewer calories when eating out or getting a takeaway. The regulations will also allow businesses to provide menus without calorie information at the request of the customer.

Richard, , an engineer, was volunteered for the job by seven-year-old Alexander, a Year Three pupil.They studied the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun before Richard crafted a replica out of foamboard, polystyrene and papier-mache – all for £.The model, complete with the mummied pharaoh, was a huge hit with Alexander’s classmates and his teacher. Richard, chairman of Moorside Primary School PTA in Lancaster, Lancs, said: “I have a history of making stuff for the PTA, so my boy’s teacher asked himhe thought I could build one and he came out of school one day with the message to have a chat with her.  “It was a challenge, but I thought I could give it a good go, so I went away, had a think and managed to create this.” He spent  hours painstakingly crafting his sarcophagus over five or six weeks, getting to work in the evenings after Alexander had gone to bed. Richard said: “I’m really pleased with how it all came together – it turned out better than expected. “I looked up the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun for inspiration and a few styling cues to make it at least a little historically accurate for the school rather than totally made up.“The mummied pharaoh was a leftover Halloween prop, which I bulked out with more polystyrene and pipe insulation before using papier-mache for the head.” He then dyed the mummy’s bandages with tea. He said: “It was a failure. Apart from making the whole house stink like a tea merchants, when we washed the smell of tea out, they were nearly a normal colour again.” But the sarcophagus has been a success with pupils and teachers.

Their hopes were later raised when their plane ed to the runway because of a medical emergency, but the captain insisted they could not join the flight.  Michelle says the chaos cost them their £, holiday - their first since the start of the pandemic. She said: It was just an absolute nightmare. “People were just in a bit of a panic and then we got to that security line and it just stopped, it seemed like hours and hours and hours. “You can see the staff are overworked and doing two or three jobs at the same time and there were some that when they were delegated one job, they were fine and they were happy and they could do it well.  “At one point, a fella was letting people through and he got told off by another member of staff to stop letting people through and he said Iaposve got loads of people trying to get out and she said Iaposve got loads of people over here.

Dr Kidney said that most people who are infected with a rhinovirus only experience the symptoms of a cold, however there are certain groups who are more at risk of developing a more serious infection, such as asthmatics, those with COPD or an impaired immune system. He said that around % of the population has the virus in their nose at any one time and it is most likely to replicate in colder temperatures. Due to their changing nature it can be dficult to build a full immunity to them and it is possible to be infected by a rhinovirus within weeks of recovering from one. Dr Kidney said: I think we all get about six colds a year under normal circumstances and our bodies might have forgotten that during the lockdown.  The majority of those are rhinovirus and there are around % of us that have a rhinovirus in our nose at any one time and they like to replicate in colder temperatures such as  degrees rather than , which is our body temperature. So when it gets cold outside it replicates in our nose which is why we call them colds. Most of the symptoms are of a cold, cough, runny nose, sinusitis and they can make you feel just rotten but often not very very ill, where flu is much more likely to give you temperatures. Although you can still get aches and pains with rhinovirus as well.The issue is now we are looking at people with runny noses and we want to knowthey have coronavirus and the answer is they might do, but with a runny nose that can actually be a rhinovirus as well.Dr Kidney said that while the majority of people only experience cold like symptoms from a Rhinovirus, there are groups who are particularly at risk, with the virus being the cause of around % of asthma exacerbations.  He continued: Poorly controlled asthmatics are a real risk group and these are people who should be taking preventer treatments, a brown or red inhaler. They feel well between the episodes so they feel an the urgency to take medication because they are getting by with their relievers or blue inhalers, and then they can get very sick with a rhinovirus infection, so probably rhinovirus is responsible for % of asthma exacerbations and while it is very uncommon now, asthma deaths do occur. What I used to say is the common cold can be uncommonly dangerous to some people. The other that gets very sick are those with COPD, and an exaserpatation is the second commonest cause for people coming into hospital. Dr Kidney warned that Northern Ireland is currently seeing almost a peak number of Coronavirus cases, with Scotland recording its highest ever figure last week. However he says that the progress that has been made with treatments for virus have proven to be very effective, with NI having the lowest mortality rate of any country in the UK. He said: The great thing about the coronavirus is the vaccine, people who have been getting very very sick with coronavirus before are not now and the vaccine has been a huge success, it has been one of the greatest victories of science in this century. Our huge achievement has been the vaccine and it would be unkind of me not to mention all the drugs that have been developed during the trials, they have tremendously changed people. We had a lot of new treatments pioneered at the Mater, the Covid hospital for Belfast. Lots of patients took part and we tried about  drugs, four of which are now in use and it substantially changed how we do things. It was a real roll up your sleeves and get this job done effort and people were remarkable. It was great to see that collectively we could find the new treatments and see them rolled out right in front of our eyes, it was great to make that change. The doctor issued one last warning about the Rhinovirus saying: We have been getting them for years andyou are healthy you will get a cold butyou are susceptible it could make you sicker. People with asthma need to take their preventers, they could be between infections and they could get sick with a rhinovirus and COPD often lands people in hospital. It is best not to get themyou are vulnerable. I worry about older people taking care of young people, it can be a great spreader of these colds.

He had been at the Queenaposs side for  years and served for most of them as her consort - assisting her in her duties.But he also had a remarkable le of his own and was a Royal Navy hero thanks to his brave actions in the Second World War and set up the pioneering Duke of Edinburghaposs Award. He was also a patron, president and member of more than  organisations and had a passion for the natural world, engineering and technology. All of these aspects of his le were celebrated at his memorial service last month at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by nearly all members of his family.And as it approaches the first anniversary of his death aged , it seems there are several members of his family who are keen to keep his memory and legacy alive... Prince Williamaposs causes Although Prince Philip was involved in many organisations and charities over his long le, he maintained a particular interest in topics such as the environment and technology. And this approach to his work is reportedly what his grandson Prince William wants to emulate - especially when he becomes Prince of Wales, which is not a given but very likely, and eventually King. According to the Mail on Sunday, Williamaposs blueprint for doing things going forward is much the same way as the Duke of Edinburghaposs approach.Like his grandfather, William is very much interested in the environment and conservation and last year held his inaugural Earthshot Prize awards. Prince Charlesapos environmental work When it came to his views and work on conservation and preserving the environment, Philip was often seen as a pioneer. After his death, Sir David Attenborough praised his knowledge when it came to conservation and the environment.He told the BBC : He was right there at the beginning at a time when conservation didnapost mean much to many people.But he, back in the end of the s and s, when in fact the world conservation had hardly opened up... he made it a real issue, an important issue, not something to be brushed aside, not something that was a pastime but something that was centrally important.And one family member carrying on his deep interest in conservation is his son Prince Charles.Charles has often been vocal about the urgent need to save the planet from issues such as climate change and the Queen remarked last year: It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. I could not be more proud of them. Lady Louise Windsoraposs carriage driving  Although his charity work and royal duties kept him busy, Philip also carved out time for one of his favourite hobbies - carriage driving. He was synonymous with carriage driving and reportedly loved nothing more than to go haring through the countryside at high speed, whip in hand, in a horse-drawn wheeled carriage.And it seems that love of carriage driving has now been passed on to his youngest granddaughter -year-old Lady Louise Windsor.In September, Louise made her public speaking debut in a series of interviews for a documentary honouring her late grandfather.And in the interviews, she talked about how she has taken up Philipaposs favourite sport of carriage driving and said: The Duke of Edinburgh has been so involved in my driving, but itaposs slightly scary as he invented the sport pretty much. But itaposs incredible to have learned first-hand from him and it definitely made us closer I think. Camilla and Sophie Wessexaposs military affiliations  Throughout his le, Philip had a close relationship with the military - and his last public engagement before his retirement in  involved the Royal Marines. He had military affiliations to many regiments and organisations and was Colonel-in-Chief of the Rles as well as Colonel-in-Chief of The Royal Electrical  Mechanical Engineers.And now these special roles have been passed on to his daughters-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall and the Countess of Wessex. Camilla took over as Colonel-in-Chief of the Rles before Philipaposs death in  - and at his memorial service last week wore her forest green regimental coat dress. Meanwhile, Sophie was announced as the new Colonel-in-Chief of The Royal Electrical  Mechanical Engineers last week. Prince Edwardaposs Duke of Edinburghaposs award role One of Philipaposs lasting legacies is the Duke of Edinburghaposs award, which helps young people to develop skills for le and work. It began in  and millions of young people around the world have taken part in the programme. Before his death, Philipaposs youngest son Prince Edward started taking on more responsibility relating to the award. And according to the Royal Family website, he is now taken over many responsibilities from his father.

The Good Morning Britain expert pointed out how people can wear heated USB gloves, hand warmers, an electric gilet or an electric blanket to get warm without having to heat the entire house.  His guide also told of the benefits of layered clothing and thermal tops while eating food regularly keeps people warmer. Martin said: I felt sad asking my team to put this together, but my email bag is full of folk so desperate they canapost put the heat on, I wanted to try some help. Pls share. Full cost of living survival guide coming soon Martin added on his site: This is a guide I really wish we needn’t be publishing. The reason I asked Sarah and the team to put this together is due to my overflowing e-mail bag of desperation from people who can’t afford their energy bills. So don’t see this as an ‘MSE or Martin says you should do this’. Itaposs more that we’re trying to help provide some options and information for those that may need to drastically cut down on energy usage due to financial desperation and some help for others who may want to do it out of a commitment to green issues.  Martin pointed out in his guide that it costs only £ to buy a cheap electric blanket which in turn, costs p an hour to run, even in todayaposs climate of rising costs. That equals a cost per week of £.used for seven hours a day. An electric gilet, basically a heated jacket, would cost £ to buy and just p per week to run, while USB gloves would cost p per week to run and just £ to buy. Another consumer expert Jack Monroe reached out to Martin Lewis for the guide, adding: Thank you for your vital and heart breaking service, friend. I know this is taking a hell of a toll on you, please please take care of yourself out here. We need you now more than ever, but we need you well and fit for what’s to come. Martin responded: What lovely words - thanks Jack. Yes Iaposm feeling the pressure, but thataposs trivial compared to the trauma many are facing being unable to afford to live. Martinaposs loyal legion of followers praised the tips, but expressed their disbelief that they were necessary in one of the worldaposs largest economies.Jon Wilson said: Good tips but itaposs  in one of the worldaposs wealthiest economies  weaposre one step away from the Universal Credit journal suggesting claimants Google how Bear Grylls went about sleeping in a deer carcass to keep warm.

Good news came at the end of February when Walsall Council served the landowners with an enforcement notice - requiring the site be cleared by the end of May. But the owners have appealed the notice, saying they need more time to clear their rubbish pile. Resident Michael Aston said: Iaposm over here very often feeding the ducks so to see that is terrible.  I feel for the people who live right next to it who open their windows and have to see that first thing in the morning. In the summer, you get a bit of a smell off it as well. It is ridiculous. We all know each other in this street but to have to deal with that on a daily basis is totally undesirable. If people want to walk along the canal or sell their house on this street, theyaposve got that to deal with. Having someoneaposs rubbish dumped on your doorstep. You see the odd rat going across there. Itaposs been there quite a while and is part of the view now but weaposre fed up of it. Another resident Wayne Phillips added: Itaposs been an absolute nightmare. Itaposs been there a couple of years and itaposs got worse and worse. Nothingaposs been done.  Now, what we are looking at is the summer is coming, spring is coming so we will get rats again, the smell will come back like it was before. There are a lot of kids on this street as well so to have to wake up to that every morning is unacceptable. Someone needs to take a bit of ownership really. Councillors in the area praised residents for their patience and support and added that despite the appeal potentially delaying the clean-up, they were pleased to see action being taken. Councillor Sarah-Jane Cooper said: We have been working on this issue for some time but we are very pleased to see that enforcement action is finally being taken against the occupiers of this site. The conditions nearby residents were forced to live with were completely unacceptable. Councillor Josh Whitehouse added: It’s great that action is finally being taken on Straight Road, the legalities of this case have delayed action and residents have been extremely patient in waiting to get to this point. We are very glad of the end result.” Local Conservative campaigner Amandeep Garcha also said: I’m sure everyone will be pleased to see this enforcement action being taken following our campaign to clear the site. The nearby residents have been extremely patient and have had to endure this for quite some time. We can’t wait to see this blight on the area gone from our town.

Given the huge number of people she meets, it would be fair to assume sheaposd have a hard time remembering who sheaposs actually meeting - and youaposd be right. But, ever the professional, the Queen has a clever strategy to make sure she appears as though sheaposs done her research every time she meets someone new.  Childrenaposs author Julia Donaldson - who penned the famous The Gruffalo book - experienced this first hand, when she was appointed CBE at the Queenaposs honours.Julia explained to Whimn : I was told the Queen goes through the potted biographies with a yellow marker and just two words get highlighted.So when you get called up, the equerry shows her the words. I did my little curtsey and she said, aposOh, so youaposre a writer. Youaposre very popular...apos I went off thinking aposwriter  popular...apos those must have been my two words.  The author went on to say she was full of admiration for Her Majesty, who does this with some  people every session and sheaposs on her feet the whole time. But, while absolutely no one can criticise the Queen for her dedication to her work, it turns out that there are some elements to her position that irritate her - no matter how well she manages to hide it.  Ever wondered what the Queen feels like when she enters a room filled with people, knowing theyaposre all nervous about meeting her  royal author Adam Heliker explained.Well, an RAF officer who served as an equerry discloses: aposOne summer day she asked me to join her on a walk at Balmoral. She talked about how irritating it was to go into a party and as she put it, watch people peel away, like the water parting as the bow of a ship ploughed through it. aposShe said she always felt it would be lovely to just slip into a party, wandering around incognito, talking to anyone she felt like. But the thing that most irritated her was the aposinevitable hushapos that always greeted her when they saw her walking in.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Ollie Tutt, , posted the video saying how much he loved working as a delivery driver and described it as the easiest job in the country. The clip got more than a .million views on TikTok. The teen said: If you want an easy job, just go and work at Tesco, Sainsbury and do this delivering s**t. “It is possibly the easiest job Iaposve ever had, the best paying job Iaposve ever had and I get looked after. “I don’t do much, I just sit on the side of the road waiting to do these drops.“All the customers are f*****g lovely and haven’t had an occasion where they have been an a******e.” He went on and added: “Don’t work in the store though, that’s s**t and boring. “Seriouslyyou wanna do an easy job just do this.” Since it was shared on March , it has received more than , likes. However, a few days later Ollie, from East Sussex, shared another video saying his original one was seen by his manager and they werenapost happy.Ollie said: “That video got a lot more attention than I thought it would and caused a bit of a problem. “My manager told me that the store manager didn’t really mind but because I swore in that video it’s kind of bad for the company. “Which kind of is obvious because it doesn’t look really good on them.” Ollie says not long after his chat with management, he was sacked.  In a video shared on Sunday, he said: “Yep I got sacked and now I am worried about how I am going to pay my rent in a week. Ollie says he was sacked for gross misconduct and disrepute as well as for not caring enough about the whole situation. He added: “It’s not a big deal, like they are a multi-billion pound company and they care about a single video. “Yep you were all right about me losing my job, go f**k yourself. Now I am going to apply for new jobs.” A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We are unable to discuss inidual colleague cases. “Any decision to review a colleague’s employment is not taken lightly and based on a range of factors.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoSainsburysViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But official Department of Health data shows the number of confirmed infections fell by nearly a third in a week - days after free lateral flow tests were scrapped across England. Latest data shows that the UKaposs worst-hit hotspots are in Scotland and the South West, with Na h-Eileanan Siar recording the highest infection rate. Plymouth has Englandaposs highest rate, while Swansea in Wales has the lowest in the UK. Latest maps show rates have plummeted in parts of the UK, with Wales in particular seeing a dramatic week-on-week drop. Todayaposs Department of Health figures show , people have tested positive for coronavirus in the past week - down a whopping , from the previous week.But the decision to abolish free lateral flow tests for all but a small number of eligible people in England means fewer are likely to be testing, experts say. Hospital admissions of people with Covid has gone up slightly, with , in seven days - but NHS bosses say the virus is only the cause of admission in around half of cases. Yesterday there were  people in ventilation beds - the highest number since mid-February. Tragically , people have died within  days of testing positive for Covid, the Department of Health figures show.

The prevalence rate shot up from . per cent in February to . per cent in March, the data shows. This is the highest rate since the study started in May , officials said today. It found that the seven places with the highest prevalence of cases were in the South West – Plymouth, Cornwall, South Hams, Torridge, Torbay, West Devon and Exeter. The other three highest – Braintree, Colchester and Maldon – were in the East of England.  Professor Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme from Imperial’s School of Public Health, said: These trends are concerning since when a very high number of people are infected, this may lead to more people becoming seriously ill and needing to go to hospital. Although restrictions have ended, I would urge people to still behave cautiously to help protect others who might be vulnerable and avoid contact with other peopleyou have symptoms. This will help to slow the spread of the virus and lessen its impact on the NHS and our lives more broadly as we enter this next phase of the epidemic.

Today a chief medical officer in the South West called on families to accept loved ones home from hospital eventhey are Covid- positive as health services face a perfect storm.Dr Derek Sandeman, chief medical officer for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care System, made his plea as he reported that almost every hospital in the two counties was full.  And the number of people with Covid- being cared for in hospitals across the area was  - more than . times higher than in early January.Dr Sandeman said: With staff sickness rates well above average, rising cases of Covid- and very high numbers of people needing treatment, we face a perfect storm - but there are some very specic ways in which people can help the frontline NHS and care teams. If you have a loved one who is in hospital, please help staff to help get them home quickly when they are well enough - eventhey are still testing positive for Covid.  That is enormously important to help us make beds available for those in greatest need. The high prevalence of cases has sparked calls for people to be careful. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency , said: These latest study results are another reminder that the pandemic is not over, and there is still a real risk to many of us catching Covid- with infection rates so high. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in crowded, enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from othersyou have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid-. Vaccination continues to prevent a high number of cases resulting in severe disease, hospitalisation and death and remains the best way to protect us all.

The woman, who does not want to be named, was taken to accident and emergency at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin by her GP, reports the Irish Mirror.He gave her a letter asking for her to seen urgently because she was suffering from extreme pain in her head and neck. She said: I was vomiting constantly and on the verge of passing out every time I stood up. I also had a rising temperature. The pain in my head was absolutely unbearable and in that moment I honestly would have rather died than be in the pain I was in.  My GP stated all this on the letter and said I urgently needed a CT scan. The patient arrived at AE at exactly :pm and was checked in by pm after presenting her letter to reception. The patient said she was triaged by a nurse at around :pm and was told she would have a few hours wait to see a doctor but not too long. The woman then described the absolutely horrendous  hour wait she endured before seeing a doctor. The nurse could see the pain I was in so she gave me two Paracetamol, she said. I have waited in Beaumont AE many times before so I knew I would have a bit of a wait ahead of me and that was okay. Nothing could have prepared me for the  hour wait I then had for a doctor.  hours I was left sitting in a plastic chair in extreme pain. It was absolutely horrendous. I cried and vomited my way through. I went up and down asking for painkillers and anti nausea tablets. The woman said that, at about am, she told a staff member that she couldnapost take the pain or the waiting any more and was told in response youaposve got  hours left, sit down, nothing I can do. The healthcare assistant in homecare said her heart absolutely broke seeing elderly people waiting in pain in the emergency department. She said: At one point, a man in his ’s who was with his daughter, ended up leaving the department at around am. He was in too much pain to continue waiting. Everyone around me was in the exact same boat. I was probably one of the youngest waiting and I knowit was one of my parents sitting in that AE department I’d be absolutely furious. For the  hours I was sitting there, I got  minutes sleep and that was on the floor. The patient said she was brought in to get her bloods done at around am and continued to wait for hours afterwards to see a doctor. She said: The next afternoon while I was still waiting, at about pm, a member of staff came out to apologise on behalf of Beaumont Hospital for the long waiting times. She said the people who presented to AE the day before at pm were now only being seen by a doctor. She said thatyou were waiting and you think your illness could be dealt with by a GP then you should go home. Another staff member then proceeded to tell everyone they should only staythey’re aposreally sickapos. The woman said that one staff member asked hershe was okay and when the woman said aposno to be honest I’ve been waiting all nightapos the staff member said aposwell, ambulances are priorityapos and the woman burst out crying. After waiting all night, I needed a bit of empathy, not to be made feel the way that comment made me feel. I’m a very understanding person and of course I understand ambulances and those who are extremely unwell are a priority but I’m also a human being who’s in pain and who’s been left sitting evening, night and morning on a plastic chair. The patient said she was called by a doctor at pm and was seated in another area.She said an elderly woman on a trolley looked over at her and said: “I’ve been here since amand I haven’t seen a doctor yet, isn’t it like a war zone The patient said her CT scan was done quite quickly and her doctor told her to wait back in the chair beside the nurses station where I had been seated. She claims other staff members told her to move and she had to go back out to the waiting room where her doctor eventually found her at pm. She apologised for the wait and also said she hadn’t realised I’d been moved out. My doctor was absolutely lovely and made me feel heard and understood. The patient said the awful experience has put her off ever wanting to go back into Beaumont.She said: I understand hospitals are under pressure due to Covid and staff shortages but it is absolutely inhumane to leave someone sitting on a plastic chair for  hours especially with so much pain.The Mirror has contacted Beaumont Hospital for comment.

He said: “She was going to dance for him in underwear he selected. That deal went badly wrong. The fire brigade found her dead. She had been killed by asphyxia. Jackson of Dunstable Road, Toddington, Beds and his business partner and fellow security guard Christopher Hayward, also , of Fensome Drive, Houghton Regis, Beds both deny murder.  The jury was told by Judge Michael Kay QC that Jackson refused to leave prison and would be tried in his absence. Hayward is aided in court by an intermediary. Opening the case, Mr Matthew said: “Louise Rump was killed on Friday th October . She was  at the time. She was killed in her flat in Plewes Close, Kensworth.” He said she had been alive and well earlier in the day when neighbours had seen her and she had exchanged WhatApp messages with a cousin until . in the morning. “Sometime between a quarter past eleven and half past midday she was killed, he said. “Both of these defendants, in that one hour  minutes, were at her address. She was found dead after they left.“The pathologist found she had been killed by asphyxia before her body was set on fire. There was signs of an attack with bruising on her face, her left hand, wrist and pelvis. The fire was a quite deliberate attempt to destroy the traces her attacker might have left,” he said. Telephone, Automatic Number Plate Recognition and CCTV evidence from Kensworth Village Stores were alleged to have tracked the two men’s cars as they drove from Toddington to Kensworth on the morning of the killing. At . in the afternoon, CCTV from the shop recorded the two cars leaving the village, the court heard. Jackson was seen to stop by the side of the road and dumped a jumper that had Louise’s blood on it and a cardboard box, the jury was told. When the fire fighters entered the flat they found a pole dancer’s pole in the lounge and Louise’s body in the bedroom. Mr Matthew said: “That was where the fire was lit. The curtains had caught fire and there was smoke damage. At the end of the bed was a plastic water bottle. There is reason to think there had been petrol or some accelerant in it to get the fire going. The jury was told Jackson referred to himself as Louise’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ at times. They had been involved in a relationship that had ended about a year earlier. In a message on  October Jackson wrote to Louise: “It has been a year baby, since I was deep where I belong.”He went on: “Can’t you give me what I crave ” She replied: “No.” Mr Matthew said, referring to the planned pole dance, Jackson wrote: “G-string and undies ready ” When Jackson was questioned by the police the day after the killing he said they had an on-off relationship, the court heard. He denied he had been to the flat on the day of the killing but said he had been there on Thursday th February when they had a play fight and she had scratched his face. The prosecutor said there was a scratch on Jackson’s face under his right eye. Hayward made no comment to answer police questions.

Sherf Goldsworthy, a member of the Los Angeles County Sherfaposs Department Montrose Search-and-Rescue Team said: We were hollering down in this canyon, and I heard something come back. It sounded like somebody taking two rocks and putting them together. I could hear the rocks hit, and a slight echo. I could hear that three dferent times.In a post on Facebook discussing the incident, the team wrote: Our team member went down the mountainside and made contact with the missing person. Recognizing the sensitivity of the situation, he worked to build a rapport with the teenager. After gaining the trust of the missing person, he led him up the mountain to safety. Once at the top, he was treated by paramedics and released to his family. The team found the -year-old north of the park with the help of aerial footage. He adds: I found him basically sitting under an oak tree, probably three miles from where he was last seen with his mum. “He will go out of his way to kick a rock, pick up a rock, throw a rock, Those were, like, his favorite things, so I picked up the rock and threw it down the gully, and he looked at me, and he ended up giving me a fist bump.

There’s so many fake profiles out there, whenever I start a legit account I get reported and Tinder has me taken down! I’ve had a lot of dferent looks over the years, and have been on the Internet forever, so they have lots of options to work with.There’s even a fake Facebook of me somewhere that someone made, it currently has thousands of followers!I just need to keep reminding myself I can’t do anything about it, and it’s out of my control.

Ex-president and deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said Putin launched his brutal invasion of the former Soviet republic to bring peace to Ukraine, in a Telegram post.The shocking allegations were made as Western leaders shared fears Moscow is planning a new military offensive in southern and eastern parts of Ukraine. Medvedev said: To change the bloody and full of  myths consciousness of a part of today’s Ukrainians is the most important goal. The goal is for the sake of the peace of future generations of Ukrainians themselves and the opportunity to finally build an open Eurasia – from Lisbon to Vlaostok.  He further accused Nazis, murderers and collaborators of stirring up Russophobia in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union in . The ex-Russian leader also said Putinaposs special military operation in Ukraine was undertaken in a bid to demilitarise and de-Nazy the country. Medvedev added the offensive will not only be decided on the battlefields. He also questioned the legitimacy of Ukrainian sovereignty saying: The passionate part of Ukrainians has been praying for the Third Reich for the last  years.  The former president revealed on Wednesday Moscow intends to fight attempts to seize Russian property abroad in courts around the globe. He said: Our opponents … should understand that they will face a large number of cases in courts. Both in the national courts of the United States and Europe and in international courts. Medvedevaposs comments come amid heightened concerns from Western officials including NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg that Rusasia will push to try to capture Ukraineaposs eastern region of Donbas in coming weeks.Officials warned Russian troops may attempt to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea.Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky yesterday accused Russian military of carrying out the worst crimes since World War II.

Mr Zelensky said: The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.  He urged the UN to take action saying failure to do so would make the world body ineffectual. Mr Zelensky added: Are you ready to close the UN  And the time of international law is gone  If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately. President Zelensky was praised for his ferocious and passionate attack on Russian military, telling the UN that accountability must be inevitable. He said: We are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the UN Security Council into the right to [cause] death. Before Putin launched his invasion into Ukraine, the Russian parliamentaposs deputy chairman Pyotr Tolstoy said Finland and Ukraine should be incorporated back into an enlarged Russia.Speaking in January, he claimed NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will “crawl” back under the Kremlin’s sway after realising the “insignicance of their position”, according to Znak media. Tolstoy did not specy how this “restoration” might happen, but claimed it could be in the next ten years. He later claimed his comments about the Kremlin restoring its old empire at a Russian Press Day event had been a “joke”, but he previously made clear he holds such views. Last year he declared “there will be no Ukraine”, describing it as “part of Russia which has temporarily seceded”.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

It’s ultimately a long game of analysis and exclusion of implausible scenarios.”According to the study, HD is extremely bright in ultraviolet light.At first, the researchers assumed it was a standard starburst galaxy – one that is creating stars at a high rate.But after calculating how many stars HD was producing, the astronomers found it would be forming more than  stars every single year..removeThis is at least  times higher than what would be expected for these galaxies, and therefore the researchers started suspecting HD might not be forming normal, everyday stars.Dr Pacucci said: “The very first population of stars that formed in the universe were more massive, more luminous and hotter than modern stars.“If we assume the stars produced in HD are these first, or Population III, stars, then its properties could be explained more easily.“In fact, Population III stars are capable of producing more UV light than normal stars, which could clary the extreme ultraviolet luminosity of HD.”But a supermassive black hole could also explain the extreme brightness of HD.If that is the case it would be by far the earliest supermassive black hole known to humankind, observed much closer in time to the Big Bang compared with the current record-holder.Avi Loeb, an astronomer at the Centre for Astrophysics and co-author on the MNRAS study, said: “HD would represent a giant baby in the delivery room of the early universe.”HD was discovered after more than , hours of observing time with the Subaru Telescope, Vista Telescope, UK Infrared Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope.The team then conducted follow-up observations using the Atacama Large Millimetre submillimetre Arrayto confirm the distance, which is  million light-years further than GN-z, the current record-holder for the furthest galaxy.Soon the researchers will use the James Webb Space Telescope to again observe HD to very its distance from Earth.If current calculations are correct, HD will be the most distant – and oldest – galaxy ever recorded..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Astronomers observe most distant galaxy ever spotted  u study"},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022","story":"One of the five tenets of taekwon-do is indomitable spirit.That is something which has been displayed in abundance in the last two weeks, since Russian forces invaded Ukraine.Despite all they are currently facing, Ukrainian soldiers took time on Tuesday, on International Women#s Day, to hand flowers to women they stopped at checkpoints.Viral videos of off-duty Ukrainian soldiers dancing in their unorms continue to flood social media.And, amid leading the fight against Russian invaders and holding meetings with world leaders, the country#s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, welcomed the start of spring in an outdoors video, ending the broadcast with a wink to the camera.The strength of spirit Ukrainians continue to show, from the bottom to the very top, should be an inspiration to us all.Kintyre has already shown incredible community spirit in its response to the crisis – well done to every person who contributed.And, although it might not effect change on a global scale, SG Taekwon-Do#s display of support for Ukraine shows that there are people in every corner of the world willing to stand up for democracy and what they believe is right."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

His company, which is sponsoring the Estate Agency of the Year Award, has been providing research and support services to Scotland’s legal profession for  years and it continues to supply land and property searches, compile legal reports, prepare deed plans and carry out company searches for solicitors and estate agents.This year Richard predicts that those companies and iniduals who stand out against their competitors will be those who have demonstrated a sense of progress and innovation.It is that spirit of embracing new technologies and opportunities which he says have kept Millar  Bryce at the forefront of their sector and this continues to be the company’s philosophy, with its recent introduction of Landmark Scotland, part of the Landmark Information Group, which is the UK’s biggest provider of property and land searches.The commissioning of a state-of-the-art IT system has also helped Millar  Bryce to keep working seamlessly during the pandemic and to keep apace with the demands of the sector and this digital focus is also helping Landmark Scotland to provide support to the estate agency sector, which is coming under increased regulation, by building in compliance tools.Richard says he expects to see a similar innovative attitude amongst those entrants who emerge as winners at this year’s awards.“At the start of the pandemic many estate agencies and legal firms found themselves facing a digital clf, but those who have embraced the technology are now in a very strong position as we move to the next stage,” he says.This year there are  awards in total  including ‘Best Family Home ’ sponsored by DAW Interiors and Deane Harrison, Sales  Marketing Director, Daw Interiors, says: “We’re thrilled to be sponsoring the Best Family Home category – here at DAW we know the importance of family and creating a space that’s designed with them in mind.

We are looking for entrants that go that extra mile to make sure both tenants and landlords are put first at all times no matter the situation.”The Best Luxury Home categoryis sponsored by property management company, Ross  Liddell, and Alec Cassidy, director, says: “We are absolutely delighted to be associated with the Herald Property Awards once again. Over the year Best Luxury Home category has seen some very interesting and erse winners. It has been the perfect complement for Ross  Liddell and we are very much looking forward to meeting this year’s category entrants in person.”Meanwhile the Best Show Home category is sponsored by DAW Signs.Managing Director, Gary Daw, says: “We’re absolutely delighted to be sponsoring the Best Show Home category this year – as a business that specialises in signage and fit-outs, we’ve worked with many property developers on their show home designs.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

It’s ultimately a long game of analysis and exclusion of implausible scenarios.”According to the study, HD is extremely bright in ultraviolet light.At first, the researchers assumed it was a standard starburst galaxy – one that is creating stars at a high rate.But after calculating how many stars HD was producing, the astronomers found it would be forming more than  stars every single year.This is at least  times higher than what would be expected for these galaxies, and therefore the researchers started suspecting HD might not be forming normal, everyday stars.Dr Pacucci said: “The very first population of stars that formed in the universe were more massive, more luminous and hotter than modern stars.“If we assume the stars produced in HD are these first, or Population III, stars, then its properties could be explained more easily.“In fact, Population III stars are capable of producing more UV light than normal stars, which could clary the extreme ultraviolet luminosity of HD.”But a supermassive black hole could also explain the extreme brightness of HD.If that is the case it would be by far the earliest supermassive black hole known to humankind, observed much closer in time to the Big Bang compared with the current record-holder.Avi Loeb, an astronomer at the Centre for Astrophysics and co-author on the MNRAS study, said: “HD would represent a giant baby in the delivery room of the early universe.”HD was discovered after more than , hours of observing time with the Subaru Telescope, Vista Telescope, UK Infrared Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope.The team then conducted follow-up observations using the Atacama Large Millimetre submillimetre Arrayto confirm the distance, which is  million light-years further than GN-z, the current record-holder for the furthest galaxy.Soon the researchers will use the James Webb Space Telescope to again observe HD to very its distance from Earth.If current calculations are correct, HD will be the most distant – and oldest – galaxy ever recorded."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-291-april-6-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4563957.jpg--.jpg?1649147610000\n","title":"donation to air ambulance ni in nan s memory","story":" The family of the late Nan Crawford, Parkmore, Ballymena, who passed away peacefully on the th December  have made a donation to the Air Ambulance NI Charity in her memory.Nan’s husband Rodger and daughter-in-law Catherine made the donation of pound to Air Ambulance NI as it was Nan’s wish to have donations in-lieu of flowers to the helicopter emergency medical service before she passed away.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

The flag is flown for  days at Church Street.Last September, the DUP held up a TUV proposal to fly the Union flag every day on all public buildings and war memorials in Ards and North Down Borough for a report on the costs and “the potential risk associated with a full Equality Impact Assessment”.After the recent decision the council stated: “This decision is subject to the council’s ‘call in’ process and to an Equality Impact Assessment. It will not be acted upon until that assessment is concluded and the report is considered in full by the council.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The EQIA will take around six months to complete. It includes a  week consultation to assess the views of those who may be affected by this policy decision.”SDLP Councillor Joe Boyle said after the initial TUV proposal last year that unionists in Ards and North Down were “trying to outdo each other” with policies on flying the Union flag.After the full council decision, he said: “Nothing has been decided, because we are currently on a journey. It could be six months before we get anything back – first of all you have the equality impact assessment. And it depends on the contents of that, the opinions of the public within it.“There is a questionnaire that will go out, encompassing everything that you would expect, with an opportunity for all and sundry to respond, and obviously that includes staff as well.“The final views of that will have to be pummelled together, and a final report will come back to the council, probably with some legal opinion attached to it. That is when the discussion will happen.”He added: “What I was opposed to was this going anywhere at this stage – I was quite happy with the flags policy in place in the council, and that was couched in having a settled and respecting borough.“I could have lived with the war memorial part of the motion, because I understand people’s affinity and sincerity towards the war memorials, and what they really mean to people. I could live with that all right.“But I was a bit disappointed that it was latched onto the civic building.”He added: “I opposed this on the basis that I didn’t think it was worthy or timely, or actually necessary to bring in this motion to a council that is settling in nicely. I think it was a tester for unionists and unionist parties.”He said: “I do have concerns with the flag flying at our civic building, a building that is meant to be open and welcoming and neutral for all those visiting and working within.”Most ReadThe Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandRevealed:  senior NI council staff received over £k in pay packetsWest Belfast driver shamed online after abandoning their vehicle blocking a roadNorthern Ireland student loses High Court battle over A-level gradesTop VideosPlayAmbulance donated by UK to Ukraine is blown up by Russia in CCTV footage PlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Northern IrelandJude Hill: Belfast star the face of US designer’s new children’s collectionEd Sheeran was right to stand up for himself in ‘Shape of You’claim... this ruling will make people think twice, says NI broadcasterMan and woman arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs in County DownMandies in Co Tyrone road traffic collisionNorthern Ireland police to send safety equipment to UkraineLatestBritney Spears objects to paying her mother’s £, legal feesMasters Day One: All eyes on Tiger Woods at AugustaFormer Trump advisers held in contempt of Congress over attack on US CapitolDeadline nears to register to vote in May electionsHigh Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over ‘MI informant’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was followed in the table by Fermanagh and Omagh’s chief executive Alison McCullagh who was paid £, in  . Finally, Adrian McCreesh, the chief executive in Mid Ulster, was paid £, in   and the only worker there earning more than £, per year.Commenting on BCC’s chief having the most lucrative pay packet, TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive John O’Connell said Belfast taxpayers facing a cost of living crisis want to know they are getting value for money from their local authority’s leadership.“With households having suffered through the pandemic and now struggling with rising rates, residents need the council to prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes. These figures will allow residents to judge town hall bosses for themselves and hold their local councils to account,” he said.All  NI councils were asked to comment on the report. A BCC spokesperson said the salaries for the chief executives of the councils were set independently during local government reforms in  and the salary takes into account the fact that the council is the largest.“It is also benchmarked against other comparable posts in the public sector. The salaries of directors in Belfast City Council were also set after an independent evaluation of the job roles and the scale of the s the directors are responsible for in a city authority,” the spokesperson added.Antrim and Newtownabbey also said salaries are in line with the salary banding agreed for local government here.Derry City and Strabane District Council said its chief executive’s pay is in line with the appropriate local government salary scale for the post.Ards and North Down Borough Council added: “[Salaries] are benchmarked against other comparable public sector posts and are proportionately lower than in England, Scotland and Wales.’Causeway Coast and Glen Borough Council said: “Council senior officer salaries are set at a national level in England, therefore the council has little influence on these rates of pay.”Mid Ulster District Council said: “The sole staff member identied on the list for Mid Ulster District Council is the Chief Executive of the Council. Chief Executives’ salaries in Northern Ireland councils were set in  independently of the councils and are stipulated in  bands, with band  being the highest and band  applicable to the majority of councils, including Mid Ulster.”Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said that the basic salaries of chief officers in local authorities are agreed through the Joint Negotiating Committee for chief officers of local authorities.”Related topicsBelfast City CouncilDerry City and Strabane District CouncilMid and East Antrim Borough CouncilCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilLisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilNewry, Mourne and Down District CouncilAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilArds and North Down Borough CouncilFermanagh and Omagh District CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council looking to establish Poverty Commission amid cost of living crisisOverflowing bins leading to ‘health crisis’ for residents in HolylandBelfast to hold annual Troubles reflection day on June Ulster Unionist Dr John Kyle in call for Belfast to become a ‘City of Sanctuary’ for refugees and asylum seekersBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the TroublesMost ReadThe Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandRevealed:  senior NI council staff received over £k in pay packetsWest Belfast driver shamed online after abandoning their vehicle blocking a roadNorthern Ireland student loses High Court battle over A-level gradesTop VideosPlayAmbulance donated by UK to Ukraine is blown up by Russia in CCTV footage PlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern IrelandJude Hill: Belfast star the face of US designer’s new children’s collectionEd Sheeran was right to stand up for himself in ‘Shape of You’claim... this ruling will make people think twice, says NI broadcasterMan and woman arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs in County DownMandies in Co Tyrone road traffic collisionNorthern Ireland police to send safety equipment to UkraineLatestMasters Day One: All eyes on Tiger Woods at AugustaFormer Trump advisers held in contempt of Congress over attack on US CapitolDeadline nears to register to vote in May electionsHigh Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over ‘MI informant’How can the UK cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels and curb energy bills ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Yes, of course it’s me, so give me your vote so I can do that thing with the border and Stormont that you’d expect. https:t.co fuwFdbDoQR— Dara Ó BriainApril , One Twitter user posted a picture of Mr Clarke#s election poster along with the caption Dara Ó Briain, is this a new career path you#re trying .The comedian saw the funny side, responding: Getting this a lot this week.

Another user said: He’s your DUPlicate It wouldn#t be the first time — and perhaps not the last — that potential confusion arose around Trevor Clarke. Back in February the TUV announced it would be standing a candidate for May#s poll named… Trevor Clarke. Thankfully, however, the ‘TUV Clarke’ is standing in West Tyrone, which is far enough away from South Antrim, so there shouldn#t be too much dficulty. But then again, either way, a vote for Clarke would be a vote for unionism, regardless of which one it is.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Saved by the bellEarlier this month, it emerged that the Irish Republican Socialist Party— the political wing of the INLA — was to be barred from standing in the Assembly election by the Electoral Commission as its constitution did not meet legal requirements. In turn, the party accused the commission of trying to deny the IRSP access to the democratic process.IRSP supporters, however, were out canvassing for its proposed west Belfast candidate, Dan Murphy, this week — so what changed  Well, it turns out the party has been saved by the bell, with the Electoral Commission reversing its decision and allowing candidates to stand for May#s poll with less than a month to go.The IRSP hasn#t exactly been busy contesting elections for the past few decades, only running a handful of candidates back in #s local government elections, with little success. Perhaps the IRSP should have been counting its lucky stars at the Electoral Commission#s earlier decision to prevent the party from standing — might have saved it a few quid on its deposits and the party could have always saved face by hitting out at the ‘British Establishment’ for somehow stling its electoral hopes.Read MoreIrish Republican Socialist Party accuses electoral chiefs of preventing it from standing in Assembly pollTory catsFollowing the news that the Northern Ireland Conservatives could be all but finished, with the party only fielding one candidate in the upcoming election, many were left simply thinking, #Who #They have never had a huge footprint here and one of the most prominent Tories in NI, Gary Hynds, who was supposed to run for the party, resigned over the party#s stance on the protocol a few weeks ago and is now running as an independent.As Ulster Unionist activist Michael Palmer described the Northern Ireland Conservatives’ impact on the country: My cats have had more impact on my le than the Northern Ireland Conservatives ever had in Northern Ireland politics — and I do everything for my cats!

Suzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe former chair of the Northern Ireland Conservatives says local Tories are almost “an extinct species” as the party is running only one candidate in May’s election — compared to  in .Millionaire businessman Alan Dunlop, who resigned from the party six months ago, claimed the lack of candidates was “as good as raising the white flag in surrender”.Current chair Matthew Robinson, who is running in North Down as the Tories’ sole Assembly candidate, said: “The party does not comment on the views of former members.”Mr Dunlop said: “This is a wipe-out election for the party. One candidate is standing and he has as much hope of getting elected as Michelle O’Neill has of securing the leadership of the DUP.“It’s the last throw of the dice for Northern Ireland Conservatives. They’re about to become an extinct species. The party’s failure to deal with the isive and obnoxious Northern Ireland Protocol is to blame forelectoral demise.“My former party has driven a coach and four through UK sovereignty. They’ve uncoupled Northern Ireland from the rest of the kingdom and have failed to grasp the enormity of their actions.”Mr Dunlop said it was time for political change: “What Northern Ireland needs is a middle ground party that is unashamedly pro-Union — and no, that’s not the Alliance Party — that’s prepared to work without tribal affiliation for all our people.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Tens of thousands of people don’t bother to vote any longer and we have to ask why. They want something that is relevant and meaningful that meets their needs.“They couldn’t care less about a border poll or the colour of flags. They want to get on with their lives and do the best they can for their families. They want change, meaningful change that gives them the space to be whatever they want to be within the Union.”Mr Dunlop quit the party last October claiming that locally it was “run more like a supper club than a properly organised political machine”.He accused the Tories nationally of failing to enthusiastically back the operation here because the leadership didn’t want to upset the political status quo.A fortnight ago, selected Conservative candidate Gary Hynds resigned over his party’s stance on the Irish Sea border. He is now contesting Lagan Valley as an independent.The Lisburn-based businessman claimed the protocol had “done more to edge Northern Ireland out of the Union than  years of republican terrorism”.Mr Hynds said: “Northern Ireland Conservatives are schizophrenic on what is a fundamental point. Some seem to think you can half oppose and half support it, depending on which constituency you find yourself in.“They are asking the electorate to buy into a dangerous mixed message. The damage the protocol is doing has to be recognised.“It has undermined Northern Ireland’s place within the Union and needs to be jettisoned.“The party locally doesn’t see it that way and thinks it can play politics with something that strikes at the very heart of our Britishness.“The Conservatives are a beaten docket here. They have no credibility and, in my view, are beyond the point of recovery. A barely discernible pulse is all that’s left.“The brand is close to being a dead duck.”Most ReadThe Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandRevealed:  senior NI council staff received over £k in pay packetsWest Belfast driver shamed online after abandoning their vehicle blocking a roadNorthern Ireland student loses High Court battle over A-level gradesTop VideosPlayAmbulance donated by UK to Ukraine is blown up by Russia in CCTV footage PlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From the DUP’s Dara Ó Briain lookalike to the IRSP’s poll push and NI Tory catsWestminster should ensure Stormont executive can be formed after election – LongAlex KaneOpinionRallies have yet to explain why protocol has had such an impact on unionistsSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsCandidates’ debate hears call for new Department for EnergyLatestMasters Day One: All eyes on Tiger Woods at AugustaFormer Trump advisers held in contempt of Congress over attack on US CapitolDeadline nears to register to vote in May electionsHigh Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over ‘MI informant’How can the UK cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels and curb energy bills ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For any party to disregard that would be wrong.“What we want is a programme for government that reflects our values and our vision for Northern Ireland.“We want one that will tackle the issues. Part of the process after the election is getting into those discussions to make sure that programme for government is right and that the budget matches.“Obviouslyother parties are in a position to stop that from happening, we would have to consider our position. I make no bones about the fact that what you can deliver in government far exceeds what you can do in opposition.“Opposition has an important role and I would never dismiss it. It’s a role in which I’ve served most of my political career, but the two years that I’ve had in government are years in which Alliance has been able to shape departments around their values and deliver for people in Northern Ireland.”She continued: “Ideally what I would like to see is a coalition government that includes all of the parties actually focused on delivery for all of our constituents.“If that is not possible, there would be a responsibility on the government to reform the institutions. It is unsustainable for any party to be able to decide that they can take their ball home and not play any more. That isn’t the way to run a government.“If the DUP don’t want to be part of a government, then it should be possible for them to go into opposition and leave the politicians willing to serve in a government to be able to get on with the job.“The government now needs to be looking at reforming the institutions to allow those who are unwilling to step back into opposition and for those who are willing to carry on with the job.”And Ms Long criticised those who are seeking to turn the election into a debate about the NI Protocol.“The protocol has been raised with us once in six months on the doors, in east Belfast. I think that puts it in context.“I think there are those who want to make it the story of the election, who want the entire election to be focused on ision and the protocol, because they see it as a rallying call for their party, but I don’t believe it reflects the true concerns of the public or business.“What they want to know from us is that we will deliver stability. That means dealing with the protocol, but it doesn’t mean putting the protocol at the top of the chain and stopping everything  until it is resolved.”Ms Long also refused to commit her party to a position on any possible united Ireland referendum.“That will be something the people will decide, not the politicians. I don’t see why we should have to have a position on that right now,” she said.Most ReadThe Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandRevealed:  senior NI council staff received over £k in pay packetsWest Belfast driver shamed online after abandoning their vehicle blocking a roadNorthern Ireland student loses High Court battle over A-level gradesTop VideosPlayAmbulance donated by UK to Ukraine is blown up by Russia in CCTV footage PlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From the DUP’s Dara Ó Briain lookalike to the IRSP’s poll push and NI Tory catsWestminster should ensure Stormont executive can be formed after election – LongAlex KaneOpinionRallies have yet to explain why protocol has had such an impact on unionistsSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsLocal Tories ‘on brink of extinction’ as party fields a single runnerLatestBritney Spears objects to paying her mother’s £, legal feesMasters Day One: All eyes on Tiger Woods at AugustaFormer Trump advisers held in contempt of Congress over attack on US CapitolDeadline nears to register to vote in May electionsHigh Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over ‘MI informant’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may,

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and

officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it

marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle.

tourism staff with no increase in funding, he continued.ldquoFunding for the Centre was slashed from pound, per annum to pound, per annum  years ago, with the local council paying pound, in rent for the tourism centre located in the building.ldquoThis means that the Centre has had to manage on pound, per annum with no inflation adjustment for over  years and now must cover the work of two full-time council staff.He added: ldquoNo matter what way the issue is spun, it is about a net cut in essential frontline tourism services which are key to tourism growth and economic development in this area.ldquoWhile I am aware of the huge amount of voluntary work and fundraising that goes on at the Saint Patrick Centre, to suggest that it can easily take up the slack for two full-time council staff looks very improbable to me.ldquoThese two posts were redeployed during Covid- and I want them reinstated..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component:

Just six weeks later, while most of N. Ireland was celebrating what promised to be a new beginning, the Orange Order brought the Province to a standstill for the third year in a row in an attempt to force a parade from Drumcree down the Garvaghy Road.I was teaching in a state school at the time and was appalled to see pupils had become involved in the chaotic protests which were dominated by paramilitaries. In June  we had a sense of optimism and hope that our two communities would come together and work for the common good, but this was destroyed by the Drumcree protests, which ended with the shameful murders of the three Quinn children, and was followed by the horric Omagh bombing few weeks later.N. Ireland does not need another period of instability, it certainly does not need more street protests where working class teenagers will suffer.Can I appeal to the Orange Order to rethink their strategy, do not let history repeat itself, do not be fooled into destabilising N.

I would prefer actuallythe Sinn Fein ministers, the Finance Ministerand the Communities Minister , who are in charge of actually getting money into people’s pockets, had been doing that during the last number of months.“When we’ve been saying for six or seven months that there’s a cost-of-living crisis, we need an action plan, we needed a taskforce, we needed action, we needed money into people’s pockets, Sinn Fein sat on their hands and talked about border polls.“They are now realising, because they’re clearly hearing on the doors that people are struggling. And that’s the number one issue. As John Hume said many years ago ‘you can’t eat a flag’. We’ve been focused on trying to deal with people’s problems, Sinn Fein have been in fantasyland.“Now it’s time we all got round the table and dealt with some of these real issues.”Mr Eastwood joined SDLP deputy leader and north Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon, west Belfast candidate Paul Doherty and south Antrim candidate Roisin Lynch as they handed in nomination papers at the Electoral Office in Belfast.Northern Ireland has not had a ing powersharing executive since early February when DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson collapsed the administration by pulling out First Minister Paul Givan in protest at Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.There are signicant doubts whether a new executive will be formed following May’s election, given the DUP has insisted it will notuntil changes are made to the contentious Irish Sea trading arrangements.Powersharing rules mean a properly ing administration can only be formedthe largest unionist and largest nationalist parties agree to enter the joint office of the first and deputy first ministers.Mr Eastwood said the DUP’s position was “shameful”.“It’s absolutely clear, all that we’re hearing on the ground is that people are really struggling, struggling to heat their homes, struggling to feed their family,” he said.“And it isn’t just people who are normally on the poverty line, although we need to help them massively, it’s people who are out working every day and coming home and having to make a decision about whether they can turn the heating on.“And that’s all in the context of Jeffrey Donaldson walking away from government. It’s just shameful, really.“What we want is people to get around the table, to get on with the work and to try to put money into people’s pockets straight after this election.“There’s no more time for political games, or machinations with political parties, theywant politicians to get back to work, get their sleeves rolled up and to get on with the job.”Colum EastwoodSinn FeinSDLPMichelle ONeillJeffrey Donaldson  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThere is ‘no evidence’ that Irish speakers are ‘marginalised second-class citizens’ says former education ministerPSNI Policing Board to press for first ever MI briefing on current activities of IRA‘The tentacles of the Northern Ireland Protocol reach way beyond mere cargo and ports – and you could see the problems coming from outer space’Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Sinn Fein should be honest on border pollMotorists advised of traffic disruption on Friday afternoon with paradeMost PopularBest walking shoes for men UK : the best men’s shoes for hiking from Salomon, Inov-, and MerrellBest sleep headphones UK : comfy, thin sleep earbuds and noise-cancelling headphones to help you sleepGarden tools  UK: gardening essentials to ensure your garden looks great, from greenhouses to compostersBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineeringBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and Lakeland                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The days of Irish speakers being treated as second class citizens are over.”‘NO-ONE IS BARRED FROM SPEAKING IRISH’:Mr Weir was education minister from springtime  until summertime last year .He was asked about the assertion that Irish speakers are “marginalised” and have their “rights denied”.“I think there’s no evidence to bear that out,” he said.“If you’re making an allegation, then I think you’ve got to bear that out with an evidential basis.”He also said: “There clearly has been a lot of support that’s been given officially and financially to the Irish langauge sector... It’s very clear that, for example, Irish language education is funded.“No-one is denied the right to speak or use any language.”In , the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition commission found that Stormont departments had spent £.m on Irish language resources over the previous seven years. Most of thathad gone on Irish-medium schools.The  census had found that Irish was the main language of only , people in Northern Ireland, far below Polishand Lithuanian .Mr Weir added that most ordinary members of the public are “crying out actually much more on practical issues than any form of ‘denial of rights’” and that simple matters like the cost of fuel are much more of a priority.He also said that there are committments from Westminster which the DUP is very keen to see fulfilled too: not least “a number of government pledges to ensure there’d be no barriers in terms of the internal market”.More from this reporter: ‘The tentacles of the Northern Ireland Protocol reach way beyond mere cargo and ports – and you could see the problems coming from outer space’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNamed HD, the galaxy candidate is some . billion light-years away, and scientists are speculating what exactly it is.Researchers propose two ideas, with the first being that HD may be forming stars at an astounding rate and is possibly even home to the universe’s very first stars known as Population III stars – which have never been observed.Alternatively, HD may contain a supermassive black hole about  million times the mass of the Sun, the scientists suggest.The observation is described in the Astrophysical Journal, while the descriptions of what it could be are detailed in an accompanying paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters .Yuichi Harikane, an astronomer at the University of Tokyo who discovered it, said: “It was very hard work to find HD out of more than , objects.“HD’s red colour matched the expected characteristics of a galaxy . billion light-years away surprisingly well, giving me a little bit of goose bumps when I found it.”Fabio Pacucci, lead author of the MNRAS study, co-author in the discovery paper, and an astronomer at the Centre for Astrophysics Hard  Smithsonian, said: “Answering questions about the nature of a source so far away can be challenging.“It’s like guessing the nationality of a ship from the flag it flies, while being faraway ashore, with the vessel in the middle of a gale and dense fog.“One can maybe see some colours and shapes of the flag, but not in their entirety. It’s ultimately a long game of analysis and exclusion of implausible scenarios.”According to the study, HD is extremely bright in ultraviolet light.At first, the researchers assumed it was a standard starburst galaxy – one that is creating stars at a high rate.But after calculating how many stars HD was producing, the astronomers found it would be forming more than  stars every single year..removeThis is at least  times higher than what would be expected for these galaxies, and therefore the researchers started suspecting HD might not be forming normal, everyday stars.Dr Pacucci said: “The very first population of stars that formed in the universe were more massive, more luminous and hotter than modern stars.“If we assume the stars produced in HD are these first, or Population III, stars, then its properties could be explained more easily.“In fact, Population III stars are capable of producing more UV light than normal stars, which could clary the extreme ultraviolet luminosity of HD.”But a supermassive black hole could also explain the extreme brightness of HD.If that is the case it would be by far the earliest supermassive black hole known to humankind, observed much closer in time to the Big Bang compared with the current record-holder.Avi Loeb, an astronomer at the Centre for Astrophysics and co-author on the MNRAS study, said: “HD would represent a giant baby in the delivery room of the early universe.”HD was discovered after more than , hours of observing time with the Subaru Telescope, Vista Telescope, UK Infrared Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope.The team then conducted follow-up observations using the Atacama Large Millimetre submillimetre Arrayto confirm the distance, which is  million light-years further than GN-z, the current record-holder for the furthest galaxy.Soon the researchers will use the James Webb Space Telescope to again observe HD to very its distance from Earth.If current calculations are correct, HD will be the most distant – and oldest – galaxy ever recorded..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Astronomers observe most distant galaxy ever spotted  u study article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"carrick guitarist simon mcbride to join deep purple on the road ","story":"Appeal after Mercedes car is stolen from driveway of house   Two people rushed to hospital after crash at Rushmere roundabout in CraigavonNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleCarrick guitarist Simon McBride to join Deep Purple on the roadCarrickfergus guitarist Simon McBride is to join rock band Deep Purple as they go on tour this year.By News ReporterWednesday, th April , : pm  \"       \"  John McCullough, Carricks own Simon McBride and Trevor Dyer during a Live at the Castle event in .

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.
